So, knowledgeable with a nice demeanor, great on policies but is she a leader?  She can lead me with all that, but those that are called reps?  Idk.

Can she defend us from... everything? Anything? Them? Us?

>The Walton family, heirs to Walmart's founder and one of the richest families in the US, have seen their wealth grow. The company earned $13 billion in profits last year, while the median worker is paid just over $19,000 a year.

>Senator Sanders introduced the [Stop BEZOS Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3410) in September in an effort to pressure Amazon to boost its pay. That legislation called for levying a tax on large companies equal to the value of the public benefits that their workers receive.

>If employers paid a living wage, taxpayers would save $150 billion a year on government assistance programs, including food stamps, Medicaid and public housing. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is among the world's wealthiest people.

>Several weeks later, Amazon announced it will raise its minimum wage to $15/h for all US employees, starting Nov 1^st. But it also said it will phase out its bonus and stock award program, though it maintains that workers will make more under the new system.

Yes the minimum wage needs to be raised, but I don't think they really stops the exploitation that companies like Walmart and Papa John's employ to generate record profits while also forcing their employees to live on food stamps.

Companies aren't beholden to their government or their employees, but they have a legal responsibility to their shareholders.

America needs to close the under employment loopholes, and needs to find a way to hold company's accountable for the knock on effects of their wage to profit ratio. 

Eg: of you make more than x profits, you are responsible for paying the social services costs of your employees irregardless of their hours. This gives them an incentive to pay a real living wage to avoid paying the cost to the tax payer, and potentially offering better working benefits/conditions as happier & healthier employees are not only more productive but don't cost them money. Right now these companies are not only weaselling out if their social responsibilities as employers, but also using your tax money to subsidize their record growths.

I personally think it's a bit dishonest to pretend they *weren't*. Regardless of the fluctuation, while the stock prices were that high, they could have borrowed money against their net worth, used that money to invest, made more than that in investment income and interest, and barely notice when the stock prices fell again because they'd already seen the benefit of the income while the price was high. And they have, no doubt, done that over and over in the past, even though they might not have this *specific* time. Yet the public doesn't have insight into their personal finances in that way.

"OK. Follow me here (add more than a few zeros to make it more accurate): Your net worth increases, allowing you to be approved for a $1000 loan. You get that loan, invest the money and make $300 interest over the next month. You pay back the loan, plus the $100 loan interest (if you were even charged that, because someone with your credit rating and net worth sometimes *isn't* charged). It leaves you $200 profit in the investment, steadily making interest over the following months until you have another $1000 you can invest in another venue.

Now...at what point in that scenario, do you CARE that your net worth fell again after that initial rise? After you got the loan approval, your net worth affects *nothing*. You still gained the benefit of the rise, were able to take advantage of it, and when it falls again the only thing it affects is how likely it is that you could do it *again* (for which the answer might be 'not right now', but is not likely to be anything close to 'never').

ALSO tell me...how many Walmart employees could make the same investment choices? How many people on food stamps could trade against their net worth in order to secure a loan for investing anything at all?

The point is...whether the gain was in actual physical money or in just the *influence* of money - they still benefited by a $12 billion gain.

It's not splitting hairs at all. You don't seem to really grasp how a public company operates. There's income and expenses. Shareholders are not employees, and are not an expense. That $12 billion did not come from Walmart. In fact, it doesn't exist. It's a current market value.

If Walmart were directly paying $12 billion expenses to a person or business that could be going to employees, that would be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

**Reactionary Wildfire Smoke Defenses:** 

1. Get children, the elderly, & the medically vulnerable out of the area if possible.
2. Use OSHA-certified N95 particulate filtering masks. They come in 3 sizes, stores usually only stock large. Bend the flexible metal strip at the top of the mask so that it fits the curve of the nose. Get it the tightest possible, they have to seal around like a snorkel mask.
3. Set home venting to recirculate.
4. Outfit homes with HEPA filters if you can, and ensure they're changed regularly.

Combat climate change at foundational levels by educating, organizing, & mobilizing to press for public leadership & regulation. We do not have 11 years. We will certainly pass 1.5°C next year. And will likely blow by 2°C in 2020 if we do not pass enact & enforce regulatory legislation in the next year.

**Specifics, Why & What Can Be Done:**

Ball-park: Humanity has used the 20% of Earth's petroleum that was easiest to develop. Half won't be economically feasible to access for centuries. The remaining 30% will be used up over the next 40 years or so if our rate continues on. We must transition from fossil fuels. This is a golden opportunity for us to come together in a common cause and spur on the benefits developed by crushing a challenge.  

>Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C... In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions decline by about 45%

-[IPCC](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15)

 >To prevent temperatures rising above 2°C, carbon emissions from human activities must be reduced by 25% more than previously estimated [by the IPCC].

Shift from a focus on individual cognition to social or structural dimensions of human behavior... As well as triggering the transition to sustainability, a [job guarantee](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/rpr_4_18.pdf ) would ensure full employment, lessen insecurity & the need to compete for environmentally destructive jobs on individual & collective levels.

Office holders at all levels must be replaced with representatives who will address the situation to the point of remedy if they do not: 

1. Have low barrier, quick access to regularly talking WITH individual citizens about the topic.  
2. Have a hard & short timeline to present draft legislation for public review that is well beyond sufficient to address this crisis.   
3. Prioritize resources in this regard & set aside political gamesmanship.  
4. Not allow commercial corporations to fund or consult beyond providing requested records.  
5. Publicly tie their employment to their success in remedying the situation.

>Global warming has a high likelihood to end civilization.

-Swedish Global Challenges Foundation

Health:  

* Elimination of glaciers & snowpack that supplies water to 1.3 billion people  
* Increased heat waves, floods, droughts, and storms  
* Hundreds of millions will suffer negative health consequences
* Reduction in intelligence from air pollution to the equivalent of a year's education being lost  
* Aside from war there's already over 110,000 needless deaths per year due to the situation (including 94,000 children) and upwards of 150 million needless deaths will result from inadequate action  

War: 

* Increase of interpersonal violence by 4%, and intergroup conflict by 14%  

>As greenhouse gas emissions increase, sea levels are rising, average global temperatures are increasing, and severe weather patterns are accelerating... this will devastate homes, land, and infrastructure... exacerbate water scarcity and lead to sharp increases in food costs. The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world. These effects are threat multipliers...  

-Pentagon  

>Extreme weather, climate change, environmental degradation, rising demand for food and water, poor policy decisions and inadequate infrastructure will magnify the continuing trend of unpredictable instability.  

-Director of National Intelligence  

* War in Darfur: Sustained drought encouraged conflict between herders and farmers.  
* Syrian Civil War: Preceded by the displacement of 1.5 million people due to drought-induced crop & livestock failure.  
* Nigerian Insurgency: Anti-government sentiment fueled by natural resource shortages.  
* Somali Civil War: Violence brought on by droughts and extreme high temperatures.  

Economics:  

* 0.25 change in ocean acidity  
* Collapse of the Atlantic Flow  
* Risk of extinction for further 25% of plant and animal species
* Disruption of agriculture, fisheries, forestry, energy, construction, insurance, financial services, tourism, and recreation industries  
* 56cm-8m sea level rise (much due to positive feedback permafrost gassing)  
* 250 million climate migrants by 2050  
* Trillions in investments controlled by conservative entities (such as Alaska's permanent fund, Swiss Re, Whitman College, the AMA etc.) are now [rapidly exiting their fossil fuel positions](https://gofossilfree.org/divestment/commitments/)  
* Economic impact after Paris thresholds are passed: [~$4 trillion/year](http://unionsforenergydemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sternreview_report_complete.pdf)

>* Will move in a countercyclical pattern—growing in downturns and shrinking in recoveries as workers are pulled into the private sector. This helps to stabilize economic activity and household incomes. Economists call this an automatic stabilizer. The government’s budget will also move in a countercyclical manner as spending on the program cycles with the economy. This too helps to smooth cyclical fluctuations. 
>* We also see the advantages of decentralizing administration to the community level. Since the goal is to create jobs in every community, and to create projects that are beneficial to every community, it makes sense to involve the local communities in the projects from the proposal stage through to implementation, administration, & evaluation.

>Recognition that public funding for pre-school through university is not only an investment in the individual, but an investment in the future of the country, could shift the spending priorities of a nation while enhancing democratic values. We should educate people for democracy. The media could assist by offering broader perspectives and fostering more debate on the facts, ethics and morality of particular stances regarding the economy, income inequality, budget policy and democratic principles in general.  

>In our schools and colleges, we need to put greater emphasis on economists working with students on global inequality and poverty. We need more scientists exploring the root causes of the planetary climate crisis and the necessity of sustainable development and renewable energies. We need greater focus in teacher-education programs on sharing the latest neuroscience discoveries and considering their implications for nurturing curiosity, creativity and confidence and cultivating a thirst for lifelong learning.  

>A consistent interdisciplinary approach can bring students in various fields together to work collaboratively in teams and respectful civil discourse: Discussions about why policies that are best for the largest number of people, fairer for all, are – or are not – adopted in our nation’s capitals.

It requires an understanding of sustainable development, and the ability to identify and research complex issues. And it requires ethical behavior.  

>We need to voice our opposition when we see the harsh, divisive and partisan rhetoric or the politics of personal destruction at work, regardless of whether we support or oppose the speaker or the target.

>Media is about what is not covered. The more important the issue is to large numbers of working people, the less interesting it is to corporate media. Issues being pushed by the top 1% get a lot of attention. My candidacy, alone, accounted for the majority of attention that network Sunday news shows paid to poverty in America, one of the great crises facing the nation. National television coverage ignores the reality of important parts of American life. Corporations have an agenda that serves their bottom line. In fact, that’s the reason for their existence. The largest media corporations are themselves owned by even larger conglomerates that have their own particular set of economic interests.  

>The extraordinary power of the multinational corporations provides billions of dollars a year in advertising revenue to the corporate owners of the media. These powerful corporations have an agenda. Six corporations control 90% of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy...  

>The political revolution, our revolution, must continue. Stay involved and get your friends involved. Run for the school board, city council, state legislature. Run for governor. Run for Congress. Run for the Senate. Run for president. Hold your elected officials accountable. Know what they’re doing and how they’re voting—and tell your neighbors. But transforming our nation is more than just elections. It’s about changing our culture.  

>Demand that the media focuses on the real issues facing our nation and the world, not just political gossip. And if corporate media won’t change, and they won’t, start new media. The Internet offers revolutionary prospects.

"> their passivity and utter spinelessness, along with their absolutely idiotic pleas for bipartisanship makes them just as complicit in cataclysmic climate change as the gop

I'm not going to defend those like Pelosi, but the Democrats haven't had control of a single chamber in 8 years, so the ""idiotic pleas for bipartisanship "" was *literally the only option* unfortunately. There was a two year window where Democrats could do something (2008-2010) and unfortunately the world economy was in the toilet and they really only got the ACA passed (understandably as it was incredibly unpopular at the time). The Democrats did do something, and the GOP obstructed essentially everything they tried for the past decade or so.  Blaming the Dems on climate change issues in this fashion is like blaming astronauts for not being able to survive without a space suit in space. Let me be clear, I support Bernie and I think his platform is the best thing we've got, but simply put Dems are in their current situation mostly because the GOP fucked up politics in America.

"Alright. Let’s look at 2016.

Bernie Sanders won 45% of the vote and was close enough to force a contested convention. He did well enough to get several of his people on the platform committee, and he forced them to create the Unity Reform Commission, which has passed important reforms that will make the finances of the DNC more transparent going forward as well as enormously weakening the power of Superdelegates by preventing them from voting on the first ballot. He did all of this prior to having the national name recognition and organization that he has now.

Jill Stein, running with a progressive third party that has been working for decades to build a movement outside the major parties, earned 1% of the popular vote and 0 electoral votes. In 2012 she only earned 0.36%. Every third party candidate combined earned less than 6% of the vote. No third party candidate has won any electoral votes since George Wallace won a handful of southern states in 1968.",WhoAteMyPasghetti,e9ohfdg,SandersForPresident

I'm sorry, but if you think Bernie Sanders, the most popular politician in America, would earn 1 or 2% of the popular vote if he ran third party, that's insanity.  When was the last time that someone of Bernie's stature ran as third party?  Comparing him to Jill Stein is hardly a reasonable comparison.

People care less about parties than they have in probably seventy or eighty years.  This is the time to do it.",thegeebeebee,e9oiq67,SandersForPresident
"Gary Johnson and Will Weld, the Libertarian candidates, had a ton of name recognition because they were both former Governors. They also got a bunch of media coverage every time Gary said something stupid (and as Trump proved, no press is bad press). They only got 3% of the popular vote.

The only time a minor party candidate has finished second (outside of a realignment) was when former President Teddy Roosevelt ran with the Bull Moose Party, He only won 27% of the vote and 6 states totaling 88 electoral votes. This allowed his opponent, Woodrow Wilson, to stride into an easy victory despite only earning 42% of the popular vote. Had he not split the Republican vote, Taft would have almost certainly been reelected.",WhoAteMyPasghetti,e9ojla7,SandersForPresident
"Sorry, you just can't compare Gary Johnson and Will Weld to Bernie Sanders.  If they have a ton of name recognition, Bernie has 1,000 tons.

If you want to go back in time, then, we can look at Andrew Jackson, who led the third-party Democratic Party to victory, and we can look at Abraham Lincoln, who led the third-party Republican Party to victory.  

Lastly, you can't look at it as ""oh, no what if we help Trump to victory.""  We are in a war against time; these risks have to be taken.  A typical Democrat, I would propose, is barely different from a Republican insofar as ACTUAL progress against global warming.  For evidence, see Obama for eight years.

>Consider registering to vote in the Democratic primary. These are the qualifying rounds.

And the Democratic Party did even better than projected:  

>* Democrats are going to get in the high 30's, possibly 40, seats... more then they've gotten in one election in 40-50 years

>* average districts everywhere moved 10 points to the left  

>* 317 districts (the vast majority) moved to the left

>* gained 7 (possibly 8 or 9) governor-ships, all over the country. The majority of the country is going to wake up to states governed by the Democrats  

>* Republicans will probably gain only 2 net Senate seats (in 2 years it better for the Democrats, in 4 years it's *even* better for the Democrats)  

>* Democrats flipped almost 400 state legislature seats  

>* Democrats gained governor ships and both houses of state legislatures in 6 states: CO, IL, ME, NV (swing state), NM, NY 

>* Democrats Took away trifectas in 4 additional states: KS, MI, WI, NH (took both chambers)  

>* Democrats flipped the Maine Senate, the Minnesota House, & won super-majorities in the Oregon House & Senate  

>* Republicans only flipped the Alaskan House  

>* Washington State passed a strong gun safety ballot measure  

>* Michigan voters legalized recreational marijuana. Medical Marijuana was approved in MO, OK, & UT  

>* Missouri & Arkansas they passed increase to the minimum wage  

>* Nevada approved a significant increase in the amount of required renewable energy  

>* automatic voter registration & and expansion of voting rights in a number of states [Florida granted voting rights to well over 1,000,000 citizens] 

>* lot of good measures in terms of housing for the homeless  

>* highest mid-term turnout in ~100 years  

>* the highest increase found in those under 30 (who now are overwhelmingly voting for Democrats)  

>* Democrats did better among both men & (especially) women

---  

>At a time when we had:  

>* more Democratic candidates rejecting corporate PAC money & corporate money in general  
>* 3.7% unemployment  
>* heavily gerrymandered seats  
>* voter suppression  
>* Democrats defending far, far more Senate seats than the Republicans were, ~10 in states that Trump actually won (we generally ended up losing Senate races were we had shitty candidates)

>* won Senate seats in all 4 states that Trump won in order to get his Electoral College majority — OH, PA, WI & MI

They also acted like Bernie was some sideshow nobody, when he consistently drew larger crowds to his rallies.

"As soon as I saw the title of the podcast it was easy to predict that they would barely mention him as a top tier candidate. Everyone on the panel was incredibly dismissive, whereas somehow good ol Joe Biden gets a pass. The negative dock on Bernie ""finishing second/third (third?) in polls"" in spite of being the runner up in 2016 made absolutely no sense. Bernie polls behind only Biden at this point, who is leading strictly on name recognition.

I'm really curious as to who's actually excited to support Biden of all people in 2020 if he runs.

TYT is solid. The volunteer wing, [TYT Army](https://join.tytnetwork.com/tytarmy/), just got a revamp. It's being led by [Alison Hartson](https://twitter.com/HartsonForCA) who was Justice Democrats pick to run against Dianne Feinstein to become a US Senator.  

[Justice Democrats](https://www.justicedemocrats.com/volunteer) was started by Cenk, Kyle, and 2 Bernie 2016 officials independently of TYT. They're solid too.  

The Poor People's Campaign has now morphed into [Repairers of the Breach](https://www.breachrepairers.org) and are certainly worth your time to investigate.

Join both the [Democratic Party](https://asdc.democrats.org/state-parties/) & the [DSA](http://www.dsausa.org/).

>People are not only running for office, but for Democratic Party offices all across this country. I was just at a DNC meeting in Chicago... 30% were 'Bernie' elected people. Change is happening but we have go to accelerate it. That requires young people and people who have turned away from the political process to reengage, to DemEnter and take the party back so we can take the country back...   

>How you put pressure on the DNC is to run in county committee elections. And you work and help whichever Presidential candidate you want to support because in that process there's a whole process for electing the DNC members from the various states, and you need to be involved...

The fact is that capitalism will always unravel any progressive accomplishments. They've done so in the U.S and they are about doing it in my home country of Sweden. It's been happening for 30 years here as well, just more slowly.

Basically, know that any change made inside the capitalist system is not forever. It will be undone by the financial powers that stand to gain from a miserable society. Not to mention social democracy does nothing to further living standards in the ""third world"". We are standing on their backs to keep the consumer economy turning.

Nothing wrong by incremental change. Healthcare and education is a human right. But know that there is another, larger goal beyond the bare necessities. And that is a society made for all people. And that can not exist under capitalism.",Solidarity365,e9mrt8o,SandersForPresident

"It's Veteran's Day and I can't help but to recall Pelosi's **unforgivable** stance on war.

\--  Congressional approval to continue funding of the ongoing war in Iraq, a major segment of the $90 billion supplemental appropriate package, passed in June 2009 thanks to heavy-handed pressure by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against anti-war Democrats.

\--In 2004 Peloski endorsed the hawkish Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who co-sponsored the House resolution authorizing Bush to invade Iraq at the time and circumstances of his choosing. When Gephardt dropped out of the race, Pelosi threw her support to Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was also among the minority of Democrats on Capitol Hill who had voted to authorize Bush's war. It wasn't until major protest and backlash that Nancy Pelosi finally spoke out in favor of an end to the war.

--During the first twelve weeks of 2003, there were a series of large demonstrations against the war here in Pelosi's district, including one on Feb. 16 that brought out a half-million people. While Lynn Woolsey and [Barbara Lee](https://lee.house.gov/issues/global-peace-and-security?latest=201) \-- congresswomen from a neighboring districts -- spoke at the rally, **Pelosi was notably absent.**

">Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was also among the minority of Democrats on Capitol Hill who had voted to authorize Bush's war.

This is a bit of a misleading statement.  A majority of Democrats in the Senate voted to approve the War (58% of them, 29 out of 50) but a majority of Democrats in the House voted against the resolution (\~60.3% voted for it, or 126 out of 209.

> It wasn't until major protest and backlash that Nancy Pelosi finally spoke out in favor of an end to the war. 

That's because *at the time of the vote* for the Iraq War Resolution, [a majority of Americans supported the war](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/19/iraq-war-continues-to-divide-u-s-public-15-years-after-it-began/).  When Bush first started pushing for the war, and leading up to the vote, there was something like 70% support for invading Iraq because of misinformation spread on the topic.  It wasn't until a couple years later that we realized it was a giant lie.  It wasn't until [a year later that public opinion started to shift](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1633/iraq.aspx).  That Gallup Tracking site also asked over time whether people thought we were deliberately mislead into the war, and it wasn't until mid-2005 that a majority of those polled expressed that opinion.  It also has biweekly polls leading up to the resolution that show 52-75% of people polled supported removing Saddam, and only 27-43% opposed the idea.

When in reality the statistics show that their kids and their kids' kids are going to be in the same socioeconomic class as them.

The same reason they rally against estate taxes when their 1 acre (4000 m^2 ) plot of land and trailer aren't ever going to get taxed. Estate taxes are just set up to prevent Donald Trumps and Paris Hiltons from sitting back and riding on their parents and grand parents success.

">She’s been speaker a couple times now and doesn’t know how to hold the House. Republicans by far have held the majority in the House and Senate.

This is... not true.  Nancy Pelosi was the first woman to be Speaker of the House and took over in January 2007 after the 2006 Midterms, and served as Speaker until January 2011 after Democrats got crushed in the 2010.  The Speakers job isn't exactly to handle House Elections.  That is the responsibility of the DCCC and individual candidates, who used to coordinate with the DNC to setup footholds across the country to recruit candidates and manage fundraising.  The problem is, when Obama took over as leader of the party after his election in 2008, he chopped the system in half and created a ""Grassroots"" organization that was responsible for getting out the vote and had no infrastructure in place.  That organization siphoned resources from the DNC/DSCC/DCCC and resulted in them having to give up on a lot of areas because they just didn't have the resources to compete there.  By the time Democrats realized how badly things had gotten, they had already lost the House, and were hemorrhaging support across the country.  

Combine that with the Republican plan after the 2008 election known as [Project REDMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REDMAP) to try and redistrict the hell out of the country, the nonsense that was the Tea Party, and resentment from the public over the stumbles of a sabotaged Affordable Care Act, and it's easy to see why the Democrats suffered so badly in the House.

"**Tax Wall Street Speculators**

* Create a tax on Wall Street to significantly reduce speculation and high frequency trading. 
 1. This plan would provide a tax credit to individuals making under $50,000 and couples making under $75,000 to ensure that they would not be impacted.
 2. Trades would be taxed at a rate of 0.5% for stocks, 0.1% for bonds, and 0.005% for derivatives.   

---  

As part of [Making the wealthy pay their fair share](https://berniesanders.com/issues/making-the-wealthy-pay-fair-share):  

**Reforming the Corporate Tax Code**  

* End the rule allowing American corporations to defer paying federal income taxes on profits of offshore subsidiaries.
* Prevent corporations from avoiding U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company through the establishment of a post office box in a tax haven country.  
* Eliminate tax breaks for big oil, gas, and coal companies.  
* Prevent American companies from avoiding U.S. taxes by corporate inversions.  
* Close loopholes that allow U.S. corporations to artificially inflate or accelerate foreign tax credits.


**Reforming the Estate Tax**

* Exempt the first $3.5 million of an individual’s estate from the estate tax.
* A 45% tax that would only impact the wealthiest 0.3% of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million. 50% for $10-$50 million of value, 55% for $50+ million, and an additional billionaire’s surtax of 10%.  

* End tax breaks for dynasty trusts.
 1. Strengthen the “generation-skipping tax” by applying it with no exclusion to any trust set up to last more than 50 years.
 2. Bar donors from taking assets back from GRATs just a couple of years after establishing them 
 3. Ensure walthy families pay income taxes on earnings generated by assets in “grantor trusts.”
 4. Sharply limit the annual exclusion from the gift tax for gifts made to trusts.

* Close other loopholes in the estate and gift tax, including valuation discounts.
* Protect farm land and conservation easements, 
 1. Allow family farmers to lower the value of their farmland by up to $3 million for estate tax purposes.
 2. Increase the maximum exclusion for conservation easements to $2 million.

**Lift the cap on taxable income that goes into the Social Security Trust Fund**

* Tax on all income above $250,000 to expand Social Security benefits and to ensure that Social Security remains solvent for the next 58 years. 98.5% of wage earners would not see their taxes go up.  


**Reforming the Personal Income Tax**

* End Tax Breaks for Capital Gains and Dividends for the Wealthy: Repeal the special, low income tax rates on capital gains and stock dividends for married couples with incomes greater than $250,000.  

* Higher Income Tax Rates for the Wealthiest 2.1% percent of households.  
 1.  37% on income $250,000-$500,000.
  2.  43% on income $500,000-$2 million.
  3.  48% on income $2 million-$10 million.
  4.  52% on income $10 million and above. 

* Limit tax deductions for the rich: Replace the Alternative Minimum Tax, PEP, and the limit on itemized deductions with a $0.28 dollar limit on tax savings for each dollar of deductions for households with incomes above $250,000.

"> Do people understand what free schools and Medicare for all do to our taxes?

Your taxes will go up less than what you pay now in premiums, unless you're so wealthy as for it to not even matter anyway. People who have already been through school might not see a personal benefit to free higher education, but their children will. Or maybe they want to go back to school to study for a new field. The idea that we can't pay for that, when we pay for school up through highschool already, just doesn't make sense.

""We can't afford it"". Why not? You don't keep paying the healthcare premiums or the tuition costs of you start paying for them through taxes; they don't pile up together. And if the richest nation in the world can't afford it, then why do other countries manage to?

Healthcare costs and inadequate coverage is *killing* and *bankrupting* people. Student loan debt is creating a massive bubble that is destroying our economy by draining money that would be invested and spent on homes, cars, and goods into interest on loans.

This country and its economy cannot survive these problems. It's not that we can't afford to do these things. We can't afford *not* to do them. But the left is fucking *garbage* at getting its message out, properly messaging with the appropriate facts and stats, and controlling the narrative. So we have disingenuous ""how do we pay for it?"" discussions or people saying ""medicare for all with cost 32 trillion dollars"" while omitting that the 32 is compared to the 34 we *currently spend* on healthcare. You frame it that way when you want to push a narrative, not when you're arguing in good faith. Nobody looks at a competing internet company and thinks ""well shit it's $50 a month I can't afford that on top of the $90 I pay now..."" Obviously you stop paying the 90 and you take the better deal of 50. But when we talk about *healthcare*, people flat out spread *lies* painting it as something else.

So do I understand what medicare for all would do to my taxes? I'm fucking out $400 a *month* for insurance premiums which next year will be for a bottom of the barrel plan. That's $4800 a year just for the *privilege* of still having a several thousand dollar deductible and paying for care when I need it. That premium is a 10% tax on me if I was making 50k a year, and I'm *not*, not even counting the thousands more I'd have to spend to actually get care. Even if my taxes went up ten fucking percent (which they will NOT), I'd *still* be better off because I could go in for care that I wouldn't *still* have to pay out of pocket for or have a deductible on.

>Schumer reached an agreement late Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fast-track the confirmations of 15 Trump-nominated judicial picks. Seven federal district court judges were confirmed that day, and eight were put on the docket for confirmation next week...  

>Democratic leaders could “take a stand” by putting one senator on the floor at all times to object to a nomination. That would force McConnell to run through the “cloture” process for each nominee, meaning he would need to get 51 votes to end debate and start a vote to approve the nominee. Therefore, two rounds of votes would be required, each requiring 51 senators to agree.

>One of the major reasons why the middle class is collapsing and the gap between the rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider is because of the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street.

>Millions of Americans lost their homes, life savings, and ability to pay for college because Wall Street gamblers crashed the economy in 2008.

>During the financial crisis, the taxpayers of this country provided Wall Street with the largest bailout in the history of this world — $700 billion from the Treasury Department and $16 trillion in total financial assistance from the Federal Reserve.

>While Wall Street has fully recovered from the recession and, in many cases has never had it so good, the typical middle class family is earning less income today than it did 26 years ago and students are drowning in debt. It is time for Wall Street to pay society back for the tremendous damage it did to the middle class of this country.

>Senator Sanders will fight for the creation of a tax on Wall Street to significantly reduce speculation and high frequency trading which nearly destroyed the economy seven years ago.

>Importantly, this initiative would also raise the revenue necessary to make public colleges and universities tuition free, create jobs, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, protect our environment, and make other investments in our future.

>This proposal would not tax investors, retirees, or parents saving to send their kids to college. Instead, it would impose a tax on Wall Street investment houses, hedge funds, and other speculators. If those Wall Street investment houses chose to pass the tax along to investors, this plan would provide a tax credit to individuals making under $50,000 and couples making under $75,000 to ensure that they would not be impacted.

>Under this proposal, trades would be taxed at a rate of 0.5 percent for stocks, 0.1 percent for bonds, and 0.005 percent for derivatives. This means, for example, that a trade of $1,000 in stocks would be subject to a tax of $5. A trade of $1,000 in swaps or other derivatives would be subject to a tax of five cents.

>Even at such low rates, this plan would provide a huge benefit by reducing one particular type of trading that does not benefit our economy: high-frequency trading that rewards technological schemes rather than investing in productive businesses.

>For example, some traders have focused their energy on obtaining information about trades a fraction of a second before others, sometimes by locating their computers physically closer to where trades are happening. These computers then rush to buy or sell before others can respond, turning what would otherwise be a ripple in the market into a tidal wave that destabilizes the financial system.

>There is considerable precedence for this. The U.S had a Wall Street speculation fee from 1914 to 1966. And, today some 40 countries throughout the world have imposed a financial transactions tax including Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, China, India, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Brazil.

>More than 1,000 economists have endorsed a tax on financial speculation and 11 European countries have committed to enacting a financial transaction tax. This idea is also supported by more than 170 organizations in the U.S., including the AFL-CIO, National Nurses United, the National Organization for Women, NETWORK, Oxfam America, Public Citizen, the Sierra Club and many others.",Chartis,e9jgh5d,SandersForPresident
"I know what HFT trading is. Just because it disincentives it doesn't mean it doesn't reduce liquidity. HFT isn't even a bad thing. If you do want to reduce HFT, then taxing everyone .5% for making a trade will do it but cause so much harm on top of it. You could easily do something else like just limit the frequemcy of trades before putting in progressively jihher fees.

At .5% per, if you want to trade even once a month boom that's 6% of it gone. Twice a month is 12%, which would be all your gains. You'd be losing money because you'd get taxed on income on the years you come out ahead. That is barely even day trading level. (It isn't even 3 times a month actually...)

HFT will cease to exist, day trading will cease to exist, infrequent trading will be uncommon, anything but long term holds will be rare.

And doctors would also be saving significant amount of [hours wasted on bureaucracy](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2018/09/11/medicare-all-and-myth-40-physician-pay-cut) each week.

To the whole program he says it much better than me, but here's a cost overview: The US is already spending [$3.2 trillion](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/highlights.pdf) a year on health care, that's the highest per capita rate in the world.

As there isn't a [CBO](https://twitter.com/StephanieKelton/status/908374836807905280) score yet we can see a broad overview. Instead of going through inefficient middle broker companies:   

Lessen the inefficiency and negotiate drug prices to save ~$600 billion. The tax reform costs companies and the 1% [(those making $719,000 or more)](https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2017) the overwhelming bulk of the $[1.6t](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all?inline=file). That's 2/3^rds (talking generally since we don't have exact scores yet).   

The other 1/3^rd is what the government already pays for health care, over $1t. 

When MFA passes much will be paid for by companies and the 1%. There will be better services for the same price because the the inefficiency and power imbalance will be reduced. Also everyone needs services like dental/mental/vision/pharmaceuticals and it's easier to manage & cheaper when done all together.  

If it's more (still likely a yuge boon) it's nice to know the financing isn't tied to the bill. So the tax strategy can be reevaluated even though like all other programs it comes out of general revenue. Bottom line is it will save lives, [improve satisfaction](http://www.asaging.org/sites/default/files/images/Brodie-Hamel-Norton-figure1.png), virtually eliminate paperwork, free up people to easier work where they wish, provide preventative care, cover dental, mental, vision, pharmaceuticals etc, alleviate the constant stress of worrying about personal medical costs, and [save](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFwMgK3XgAkODiq.jpg) the citizens [money](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFwP1nPVwAEWDVt.jpg).

To be fair, though, having a female VP pick would have one huge advantage: shutting up the establishment Dems about their idpol bullshit.

######Civic Engagement

Attend local [political meetings](https://ourrevolution.com/groups/) & [events](https://go.ourrevolution.com/page/event/search_results?country=US). 

1. Ensure representation who will attempt to remedy the situation elected to offices. This goes to the larger topic of revitalizing American democracy.  

2. Engage in everyday civics, exercising influence by pressing the powers-that-be to accountability, being hungry for transparency, supporting beneficial efforts, and educating, organizing, & mobilizing the citizenry.  

Emergently such action can through public offices & ballot measures (as well as influencing commercial organizations through boycotts, strikes etc):

>When people talk about how well we did with young people, clearly one of the reasons for that was our success with social media....

Issues being pushed by the top 1% get a lot of attention. My candidacy, alone, accounted for the majority of attention that network Sunday news shows paid to poverty, one of the great crises facing the nation. National television coverage ignores the reality of important parts of American life. Corporations have an agenda that serves their bottom line. In fact, that’s the reason for their existence. The largest media corporations are themselves owned by even larger conglomerates that have their own particular set of economic interests.  

>These powerful corporations have an agenda. Six corporations control 90% of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy.

>* generate over $100 billion by 2024 in higher wages for workers, benefiting their local economies.   
 
>* gradually eliminate the loophole that allows tipped workers and workers with disabilities to be paid substantially less than the federal minimum wage.  

>* phase out the youth minimum wage, which allows employers to pay workers under 20 years old a lower wage for the first 90 calendar days of work  
 
>Since 2012, when striking fast-food workers first launched the ""[Fight for $15](https://fightfor15.org/)"" the cities of Seattle, Minneapolis and Washington have all raised the minimum wage to $15/h.

 Tulsi has worked with him on legislation and actually nominated him at the Democratic National Convention in 2016. She had been a Vice Chair of the DNC and stepped down from her position, which is supposed to be neutral during primaries, so she could support Bernie’s campaign. She’s also one of the few Superdelegates to vote for him.

Nina Turner was a very vocal supporter of his Presidential campaign and a crucial part of his campaign. She was a primary campaign surrogate for him, often appearing on television to make the case for his campaign and pushing progressive policies. She is now leading Bernie’s political organization, Our Revolution, as has been touring the country with him pushing for progressive candidates.

To take a small step back from their progressive bonafides for a moment, the fact that they’re both women of color is certainly a plus. Tulsi’s status as a veteran (a Major in the Hawaii National Guard) also makes her appealing to some who might not traditionally vote for Democrats. These things are obviously secondary to their policies, but you can’t deny that they’re important electorally.

"This system is very well thought out and I think it would go a very long ways towards making the US political system legitimately democratic, instead of democratic-in-name-only as it has always been.

My main worry is that this is precisely the reason it won’t happen.  We only have a two-party system because our current single-member FPTP voting system creates a spoiler effect.  With a system like this, there would be no structural mechanism maintaining the two parties’ electoral cartel.  With this system, other parties would have just as much electoral power, so both major parties would face much more competition from others, and people would not feel coerced into voting for D’s or R’s just to prevent the other coming to power.  As such it is in the interest of both major parties to keep the status quo.

"The DNC and the GOP are largely similar. Economically they both favor corporations having power and control. They both place corporate executives or former leaders into their cabinets and chairs. 

The difference in the parties is social. The DNC will be more in favor of social liberalism as we saw with gay marriage recently. They are generally in favor of progressive lifestyles, *as long as doing so will not hurt established business/corporate interests.* Allowing gay marriage, for instance, did not cost anyone with major interests and stakes anything, so it was not stopped. Same with abortion rights and so forth. The GOP takes traditionally conservative stances on these issues.

Bernie and the progressive platform is the only economically left wing platform in the country. It is also socially left in most cases, and in fact in mostly ""do what you want as long as it isn't hurting other people"" hands-off to its roots. There is a lot of overlap with libertarianism here, and when you hear that Bernie's platform appeals to the right, it's often because of this. It defers heavily economically, where progressives strongly believe in government allocating the budget to provide the services that are required for life and a strong society to function. An example is universal healthcare for all: everyone will be sick, and a profit motive for healing them does not contribute to a strong society. DNC/GOP/Libertarians have differing views from this, with the former two acting in the interests of corporations like insurance and pharmacy (or whatever the topic is) and libertarians argue government should be completely divested from providing for people's needs since competition will lead to the greatest possible offering.

So there's no real ""this party is best"" and maybe not all candidates or platforms tick every box for you. There needs to be some balance, but currently, there is no real way to vote for economic left-wing policy or libertarian social policy. I think libertarians are gaining a lot of ground in more states election after election, including in Ohio where they outdid the greens.

"Tuition free public college would keep your kids from having to go into debt getting their degrees.

Medicare for all would lower your family’s spending on health insurance and probably increase your coverage.

Expansion of Social Security helps with your retirement.

Transitioning to clear energy saves the environment (important if you don’t want the species to die) will lower energy costs (good for the pocket book) and create jobs.

Slashing the military budget will allow us to redirect fund to the programs I have outlined while still having enough left over to cut taxes for the middle class.

As per the ever present “how are we going to pay for that” question:

Universal healthcare is cheaper overall than private insurance. Any increase in taxes to pay for it would be less than you and your employer currently pay for premiums.

We could have paid for every student to attend college for free this year with only the money spent on the INCREASE in defense spending that the Republicans passed

Social Security can be expanded by raising or eliminating the cap on taxable income (that way the rich don’t get out of paying their fair share)

Clean energy pays for itself because, unlike fossil fuels, it’s renewable, free and abundant (we’ll never run out of sun, wind, or running water).",WhoAteMyPasghetti,e9lkstj,SandersForPresident

The recent notification by a white hat pen tester of a vulnerability at the SOS’ office, which went immediately to the Dem headquarters and then to the FBI.  Kent took his office’s incompetence and had a press conference to say the Dems were “hacking the election.”

So much more.  Just google or someone else fill in some of the other illegal/unethical stuff.

"That’s frequently my point, there are basic tenets of the conservative ideology that aren’t let’s say wrong for lack of a better term right now. It’s just another way of looking at the world. And that’s awesome and diverse and brings variety to the political arena and could bring another point of view to the table when looking for solutions. BUT, if every racist and overall hater, call them nazis and/or KKK and/or NRA and/or white supremacist and/or Christian fundamentalist, flocks toward the GOP, there’s gotta be something fundamentally wrong there. You can accuse left wing extremists of tree huggers, hippies, socialists, Europeans, whatever you want. There’s typically no violence or hate involved. Think of the right wing extremists: driving over a pacific demonstration, sending bombs to people, killing innocents. Such a huge red flag that something is not right. And of course, not every conservative is like this. That’s an ignorant idiotic claim. But it is kinda true that let’s say a very large number of violent extremists are conservative. Think of last election. Be a conservative. Suddenly, nazi organizations endorse your candidate. Damn. Ok. Suddenly, KKK endorses your candidate. Damn. But ok ok. Suddenly you hear that every white supremacist in general is jumping of joy because of your candidate’s rhetoric and overall demeanor. Hot damn man. What do you need to see happen so you can just back off?! But then again. Easy for me to see. Not so easy for other people, otherwise those honest, hard working, smart, educated conservatives would’ve done something other than voting for someone as despicable as Trump. Hillary is a POS, granted, ok. But was she really worse than the candidate of the nazis, the kkk, the White supremacists, the candidate of totalitarian regimes?

So what democrats have proposed is subsidizing education to get these people new, better, more modern jobs. The rust belters seem to have declined that because to them, their jobs are their way of life. To be a little less kind, there is nothing scarier to a conservative than change.

"> Pretty much anyone who would vote republican at this point will NEVER vote for a democrat

This isn't (and shouldn't be) about persuading conservatives to vote for Democrats. It's about mounting a cohesive movement against conservatives, one with the sort of super-majority required to overcome the hurdles of gerrymandering, voter suppression, unbridled campaign finance, and our two-party system.

We must draw a firm line between pushing hard for progressives within the party and allowing our internal squabbles to be used by Republicans to divide our vote and de-motivate progressive voters on Election Day. The time to push for progressives is before and during PRIMARIES. But we must never again allow Trump, the GOP, and their Russian sock puppet army to manipulate and fragment our vote and contribute to our own defeat.


",freediverx01,e9jw83c,SandersForPresident
Trump voters are reactionaries. They **liked** the dark (social) past and want to return to it. They're also stupid enough to blame their economic situation on immigrants and minorities. There's no reasoning with these people. They are the deplorables and their numbers are dwindling. ,freediverx01,e9od65u,SandersForPresident
"Hey, I'm with you, but it's also the moderates that need to wake up.  A message must be sent to the DNC and their PACs as well to stop undermining progressives.  Brent Welder KD district 3 is a perfect example, and there are others, where a PAC swoops in with boatloads of cash for no good reason other than to primary out a progressive for a corporate democrat who will play ball.

Corporate Democrats are only slightly better than the GOP, but a progressive or a socialist is leaps and bounds better than a corporate Dem.  I personally still vote for the lesser of evils in the general, but I'll never shame someone for voting third party when the DNC starts fucking with the primaries and picking republican-lite candidates.",ChiefnThatLoud,e9jwy8m,SandersForPresident
"We're in agreement on the sort of politicians we want. Where we differ is in the importance of taking a strategic view, and on the dangers of vilifying centrist Democrats in red states to the point where they lose to a Republican. I couldn't disagree more that a neoliberal Democrat is just as bad as a Neo-con Republican. The former is fighting to keep things the way they are (which is bad) while the latter is fighting to destroy everything we've accomplished in the last half century (which is infinitely worse.)

Do what you can to elect true progressives at the local and state levels and then go to the voting booth during primaries to support them. But never join hands with Republicans in their false equivalence arguments that gave us Trump over Hillary. Hillary would have sucked balls, but she would have been infinitely better than Trump and three branches of government controlled by the GOP.",freediverx01,e9k0be8,SandersForPresident
"I think of it this way.  The Manchin's of the world will turn on you when you need them the most, kind of like Lieberman (yeah, he was independent, whatever) caused the public option to fail.  Those ""red"" states are mostly red because of the uninspiring democratic candidates there.  The GOP has no new ideas, just an identity they sell.  But if the DNC can support more candidates that are exciting and offer things that those moderates are unwilling to put on the table, more people register, more people vote.  Like I said, you won't lose moderate republican votes, because those votes do not exist for democrats.  Moderate republicans either vote R when they're fired up, or they stay home when they aren't.  We need to fire up our base!

But yeah, the DNC still has a stranglehold on everything, and the PACs they are in league with do too.  There is much work to be done by supporting DSA, Justice Democrats and other orgs like Our Revolution.",ChiefnThatLoud,e9k0ucw,SandersForPresident
"> The Manchin's of the world will turn on you when you need them the most, kind of like Lieberman (yeah, he was independent, whatever) caused the public option to fail. 

Again, we're in total agreement that neoliberal Democrats are a big problem. But I still think you may be missing the broader picture that ""failing to pass the public option"", to use your example, was not nearly as bad as ""stacking the Supreme Court with with lifetime appointments of hard-right ideologues"" or ""passing a disastrous tax law that accelerated wealth and income inequality while paving the road for drastic future cuts to social services.""

I know it's a difficult concept, but we need to fight on two fronts at the same time — pushing hard against centrists within the DNC, while taking back all three branches of government from the GOP. If we fail to accomplish the latter, the consequences will take decades to correct.

> Those ""red"" states are mostly red because of the uninspiring democratic candidates there.

I think that's definitely true in many districts, but not in all. Some parts of this country are hopelessly right-wing, and those areas will never elect a Democrat. The best we can hope in those cases may be to elect a centrist Democrat who will side with us at least some of the time. But of course there's disagreement over where to draw that line, and centrists in the DNC want to exploit that uncertainty to push for neoliberals in many places where they don't belong.

>[Fixing the Tax Code for Citizens, Corporations & Banks](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-economic-inequality/#fixing-the-tax-code-for-citizens-corporations-and-banks): Currently the super-rich and the largest corporations and banks in America don’t pay their fair share of taxes, which means there’s not enough funding for programs that will alleviate systemic inequalities.

>[Expanding the Social Safety Net & Increasing Access to Opportunity](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-economic-inequality/#expanding-the-social-safety-net-and-increasing-access-to-opportunity): Use revenue from progressive taxation to expand and create programs to help alleviate poverty and help Americans move forward and contribute to a more robust, equitable economy.

######Be The Press & Press The Press

>When people talk about how well we did with young people, clearly one of the reasons for that was our success with social media....

>Media is about what is not covered. The more important the issue is to large numbers of working people, the less interesting it is to corporate media. Issues being pushed by the top 1% get a lot of attention. My candidacy, alone, accounted for the majority of attention that network Sunday news shows paid to poverty, one of the great crises facing the nation. National television coverage ignores the reality of important parts of American life. Corporations have an agenda that serves their bottom line. In fact, that’s the reason for their existence. The largest media corporations are themselves owned by even larger conglomerates that have their own particular set of economic interests.  

>The extraordinary power of the multinational corporations provides billions of dollars a year in advertising revenue to the corporate owners of the media. These powerful corporations have an agenda. Six corporations control 90% of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy.  

>Demand that the media focuses on the real issues facing our nation and the world, not just political gossip. And if corporate media won’t change, and they won’t, start new media. The Internet offers revolutionary prospects.

######UN Recommendations:  

1. Acknowledge that America’s proudest achievement –a vibrant democracy– is in peril unless steps are taken to restore the fabric from which it was crafted, including the adage that ‘all are created equal’. 

2. Stop irrationally demonizing taxation and begin exploring how reasonable taxes can dramatically increase the social well-being of Americans and the country's economic competitiveness. 

3. Provide universal healthcare, as every other developed and many developing countries already do. This would rescue millions from misery, save money on emergency care, increase employment, and generate a healthier and more productive workforce.

The increases are always phased in over time, so it’s not like they’re going to suddenly have to pay $6 more per hour out of nowhere. The loss due to paying higher wages is made up for by the in creased sales resulting from those in the community having more money to spend.

>Now, without any basis in fact, Trump has uncovered a ""big corruption scandal"" in Florida because his candidate, Rick Scott, might lose a very close election in a recount.

>The election officials in Florida must not be intimidated by Trump's dishonest, outrageous and anti-democratic outbursts. They must stand up for the democratic process - and count every vote.

>Let me be absolutely clear: Donald Trump, Brian Kemp and Ron DeSantis ran racist campaigns. One ad the Republicans put out was even rejected by Fox television because of its racist content. They used racist rhetoric to divide people and advance agendas that would harm the majority of Americans.

>In Florida, Andrew Gillum, whom I was proud to stand with even during the primaries, faced week after week of racism from his opponent and allied forces. That's just a fact. And in the end, I believe those craven attacks founded in ""fear of the other"" had an impact on the outcome. Stacey Abrams faced similar attacks, in addition to unprecedented voter suppression. That's a reality that has to change.

>It is our job now to continue to offer an alternative to the hate-filled agenda of Trump and Republican operatives. We need to offer a vision that all people, regardless of their race or country of origin, are part of a shared destiny as one people. We have to fight for the soul of our country at this critical moment. Part of that effort is to be honest about what our divisive opponents are trying to accomplish and how it is tearing at the very fabric of our democracy and our common humanity.

On days like this we are reminded of the sacrifices made by all those women and men who have worn the uniform in defense of our nation. We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude, which we will never truly be able to repay.

From local veterans’ service organizations, to the VA Hospital in White River Junction, to the seven Community Based Outpatient Centers that serve Vermonters, to the two Vet Centers, veterans throughout our state have a place to go when they need care, services or just someone to talk to who understands their unique experiences.

>As a longtime member and former Chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I am honored to work every day to keep that promise to our veterans and their families. Now, more than ever, it is critical that we all work together to preserve, protect and improve the VA. What I hear from veterans all over Vermont is that we must strengthen the VA, not dismantle it. I hear them, and I promise to ensure that these veterans and their families in Vermont and around the country receive every benefit they have earned and deserve.

We need an anti-racist “populism,” one that speaks to the same issues of corporate concentration and unequal bargaining power, but without spreading fear about immigrants and Social Justice Warriors. This can be done: Sanders showed it in 2016, and I still think he would be an extremely effective challenger to Trump in 2020. He can prove that Trump’s “man of the people” shtick is phony in a way that Hillary Clinton never could, because she was too closely associated with Wall Street and the Iraq War.

Carlson-ism is so dangerous because parts of it are right.

>Today, there are crucial conversations rippling across North America—conversations happening on social media, on campuses, in the streets and around dinner tables. In greater numbers, people are talking about real empowerment and liberation for historically disadvantaged groups. When it comes to the Black Lives Matter movement, they’re talking specifically about human dignity for African Americans. And for this movement, journalist, humanitarian, and activist Shaun King is amongst the most compelling voices: a humane and passionate advocate for justice and families, and an extremely visible fundraiser for victims of brutality and discrimination.  

>This past year Shaun bravely spearheaded the efforts to identify and arrest violent white supremacists who brutally attacked men and women in Charlottesville, Virginia. His dogged efforts single-handedly led to more arrests of Neo-Nazis there than that of the FBI or State Police.  

>Leaders like Shaun King help us see how racism is not dead and forgotten, but merely a mutating virus, and one that manifests in different forms in every age. Racism, mass incarceration, policies that criminalize blackness in the twenty-first century—these problems won’t solve themselves. And that’s why King’s voice, perspective, and work are so important.  

>As a magnetic element of the Black Lives Matter movement, King helps us see our present place in the larger current of American history. He’s adopted social media to rally and unite people of disparate backgrounds and has now become one of the most followed activists in the world. He uses his platform as a journalist, now for Harvard and The Intercept, and formerly as The Senior Justice Writer at the New York Daily News, to unearth the truth beyond local media, and to organize us all in purposeful and directed ways. Moreover, he reminds us that we can take whatever we do best—whether we lobby, speak, litigate, protest, write, or more—and tilt that practice toward justice.

2. Public Option: Give everyone the option of choosing either private insurance *or* Medicare/Medicaid. This solution keeps private insurance in the game, but makes them compete with the govt options.

This is a political norm, both sides of the aisle take it as a given of the german political context. Another example is that people in Germany believe universal healthcare is a right.  I'm not saying other countries dont have their nutters, and MMP can certainly deliver nutjobs in the fringe, but they tend to stay fringe.

The most startling reality is that every one of the voters who were turned away was black or brown. Each had gone out of his or her way to get to that polling place. And each of them was essentially told, “Sorry, but you have no voice here. You have no right to vote.”
Now replicate that same scenario in every precinct and polling place across Richmond County, then across Georgia as a whole. Shave away 2 percent of all voters in Atlanta, Augusta, Savannah, Macon or anywhere else. Then look at the margin by which Kemp appears to have defeated Abrams: 62,000 votes, or 1.6 percent.

States with fewer people should have a proportionally smaller say over national matters. I don’t understand how that could possibly be a controversial opinion.

Yes! That’s the whole point! We desperately need a restructuring of our country. We currently allow millions to live in poverty despite being the richest country the world has ever known. Thousands of people die every year because they don’t have insurance. A government that allows that to happen clearly needs to be restructured.

But allowing Wyoming and Alaska to dictate law and politics for California and Texas isn’t absurd?

What’s the logic behind this thinking? The largest dozen or so states have most of the US population, but I can’t think of a single policy where the largest states would all agree on one position while the smallest states would all agree on the opposite position. In all honesty, if you could get the wildly differing electorates of Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, California and Florida to agree on something, then it must be what the nation wants.

> Simply basing things on how many people think a particular way is a dangerous. This was the reason that a Check was put on the legislative branch via presidential veto, SCOTUS determinations, and also the entire purpose of the creation of the senate.

Then explain why the countries that have parliamentary systems with proportional voting systems haven’t devolved into utter chaos. Explain why many of them, such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, beat us in major areas like education, healthcare, middle class strength, life expectancy and happiness.

The reason the senate worked was that the federal government was supposed to be seriously limited it what I handled and each state was supposed to do it. There is nothing stopping any single state from setting up universal Healthcare, common sense gun laws, improving the education system, fixing their electoral proceedings.

As for the the parliamentary system, there is no Supreme Court, there is no chief executive to sign off on things. The ruling party of parliament controls everything. Meaning if the party has a majority, then that party does whatever they want. Can you imagine the last 2 years if federal judges hadn't squashed some of trumps policies, or at least held them up? The real issue at hand is not the senate, it's the God awful state of our politics.

“States rights” is a dumb concept that deserves to be wrecked, especially considering the fact that there isn’t a single politician that genuinely believes in the concept. They all only believe in “rights” for the states whose governments are controlled by their party.

> It completely walks on the farm states.

How?

> There is nothing stopping any single state from setting up universal Healthcare, common sense gun laws, improving the education system, fixing their electoral proceedings.

It would be easier to have a federal universal healthcare system because the patient pool would be larger. Common sense gun laws work great until people realize they can just drive to the next state over which doesn’t have those laws and easily access firearms. Many parts of states’ electoral systems, such as which day elections must be conducted as well as the manner in which they elect their Representatives (from single member districts), are determined by the federal government. States also can’t do anything to eliminate the electoral college.

> As for the the parliamentary system, there is no Supreme Court

I’m not sure where you got the idea that nations with parliamentary systems don’t have courts. I’m also not sure why you seem to think that the Supreme Court is some kind of savior of Democracy. Our federal judiciary is packed full of partisan hacks that constantly toe the party line. Many nations with parliamentary systems don’t have that problem because they have an independently appointed judiciary.

> The ruling party of parliament controls everything. Meaning if the party has a majority, then that party does whatever they want. 

You mean like the past 2 years, when Republicans have controlled all 3 branches of government?

> I'd be ok with a parliamentary set up if we had more than 2 parties or at least if the two parties were significantly less volatile. 

You have the wrong order of operations here. If we had multiple parties already, there wouldn’t be much needed to transition into a more parliamentary form of government. To have those new parties rise up, we first need to change the way they are elected.

My candidacy, alone, accounted for the majority of attention that network Sunday news shows paid to poverty, one of the great crises facing the nation. National television coverage ignores the reality of important parts of American life. Corporations have an agenda that serves their bottom line. In fact, that’s the reason for their existence. The largest media corporations are themselves owned by even larger conglomerates that have their own particular set of economic interests. 

>The extraordinary power of the multinational corporations provides billions of dollars a year in advertising revenue to the corporate owners of the media. These powerful corporations have an agenda. Six corporations control 90% of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy. Those six corporations are Comcast, News Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. 

>I received 46% of the pledged delegates, won twenty-two states, and lost some states by a few votes. In other words, we had a significant amount of support from ordinary people. On the other hand, I did not win 46% of the endorsements from the print establishment and the leading newspapers in the country. In fact, I won only one. I was very proud to have received the endorsement of The Seattle Times.

Run for the Senate. Run for president. Hold your elected officials accountable. Know what they’re doing and how they’re voting—and tell your neighbors. But transforming America is more than just elections. It’s about changing our culture.  

>Demand that the media focuses on the real issues facing our nation and the world, not just political gossip. And if corporate media won’t change, and they won’t, start new media. The Internet offers revolutionary prospects.

"You are correct that one, individual vote will never effect an election as a whole. 
However, you forget that the action of voting is very rarely an individual action that merely causes a single effect. Look at it this way; lets say you vote, and in doing so you impart the importance of voting to just 5 of your friends and convince them that they need to vote. You explain how important elections are, how they are the staple of our republic, and how we as Americans have a civic duty to take part in our political system. So now, we have 6 people voting (including yourself). Lets say that your five friends, in turn, convince five others to vote. Suddenly you have 26 votes cast. Then the cycle continues. And it all of that began because one individual cast their ballot and convinced others to do the same. Politics (and by extension voting, as it the core of what makes a democratic republic) is rarely if ever an individual event. The concept of “politics” only occurs when groups of people get together and work towards a common goal. Your theory/idea that the act of an individual voting ends with the ballot being counted isnt realistic. Furthermore, in the state of NC (my home state) in the 2016 election, there was a state judge who lost his race by only 300 votes. Had enough individuals felt the desire to vote and seen the importance, then the entire judicial system of a district could have been incredibly different

Also, you are horribly incorrect when you say that other political actions (ie, calling representatives, rallying, etc...) are more important than voting. Those actions only matter when they lead to voting. You could have 1 million individuals contact their representatives, but if they do not vote then it means absolutely nothing. I am saying this as someone who has gone to rallies, who does call their representatives, and who is very politically active. Voting is the single most important act a citizen can provide for their country, because it is the only peaceful action a citizen can take to truly enact change. if you call your rep and tell them you dont vote, then they will not listen to a single thing you are saying, because you are removing yourself from the democratic process

Cynicism does not entail truth. The fact that you are espousing an unpopular opinion does not mean that you are right. It just means that you disagree with people.

Progressives won approximately 60% of the seats throughout all of California in 2017 and it was thought that this was enough to take over the California Democratic Party.  However, due to super delegates and other establishment shenanigans the party was able to keep Eric Bauman as the party chair.  In 2017 there was an app developed to help organize progressives throughout all of California to at least vote in these elections and also to help anyone who wanted to run.

"> **First impressions from Election Night? Most encouraging result, least encouraging?**
My impression is that, given the fact that Trump fired [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions today in order to remove media coverage from [Tuesday] night tells me we had a pretty good night. I think [Tuesday] night was a significant rejection of Trumpism. Not only did the Democrats regain control of the House, which was the most important development, Democrats won seven governors’ races. Democrats won 300 races at the state legislative and in the four states that Trump won in order to get his Electoral College majority — Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — all four of those Senate Democratic candidates won. And three out of the four [Democratic] candidates for governor won. As someone who worked very hard for Andrew Gillum, that was a major disappointment. He ran a brilliant campaign, dealing with a lot of things, including racism. We’ll see what happens in Georgia, whether or not they’re going to count all the votes there. But if Abrams loses, that [will be] a painful loss.

> **Do you have any plans to oppose what happened in Georgia?**
I will add my voice and do what I can! Bottom line there: We are aware of the absurdity of this guy Kemp, who is the Secretary of State, counting the votes. [He] happens to be her opponent. The demand has got to be that every bloody vote has got to be counted. I will add my voice and do everything I can to make sure that happens.

> **The Washington Post had an op-ed suggesting this means no “fire-breathing” progressives going forward, no liberals, that the way forward is moderates —**
[Laughs] Matt, I am really shocked by this! I cannot believe that that is their conclusion, given that they have been spouting that absurd line forever, and that was the line that they had which enabled Republicans to gain control of the Senate and the House and the White House and for Democrats to lose almost 1,000 seats in the previous nine years. Of course, that’s what the establishment will say, and that’s what the establishment Democrats will say. But the truth is that what has happened in this election is a significant step forward in terms of the revitalization of American democracy. It wasn’t moderate democrats or conservative Democrats who got young people into the political process. It wasn’t moderate Democrats who increased voter turnout in this election compared to four years ago, I think by almost 50 percent.
It wasn’t just moderate Democrats who won incredibly great victories for the House. There were some moderates, to be sure. But I think the Washington Post is going to be very surprised at who shows up on the first day of Congress and gets sworn in, because that is going to be the most progressive freshman class in the modern history of the United States. Many of these folks are not just women, not just people of color, who campaigned on Medicare-for-all, raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks, campaigned on making public colleges and universities tuition-free, of undoing Trump’s tax breaks for billionaires. The political establishment notwithstanding, the future belongs to progressives.

> **Earlier you mentioned Attorney General Sessions. Obviously you served with him in the Senate. Do you have any thoughts about his legacy as Attorney General, or the meaning of this firing?**
I would just reiterate that Trump knows how to manipulate the media and that it’s not an accident that he fired Sessions today, not tomorrow, not the next day. Because he wanted to divert attention from what happened Tuesday night. Sessions did Trump’s bidding. Did his bidding on criminal justice — terrible. Did his bidding on immigration — terrible. Did his bidding on a number of areas. On the one hand, the resentment that Trump obviously had toward Sessions is that he recused himself in terms of the Mueller investigation, which was the right thing to do. And Trump never forgave him. The key question right now is whether or not Trump will attempt to impede the Mueller investigation. And that must not be allowed to happen. Congress has got to pass legislation to protect that investigation. However, if Trump goes forward and tries to impede it, that is in my mind an obstruction of justice, which is an impeachable offense. So we have to do everything we can in every way to make sure that investigation goes forward. 

> **Do you have any thoughts about the leadership in the House?**
I will let them work that out themselves. I’m obviously not a member of the House anymore. We’ll let them make their own decisions. But this is what I absolutely do believe. I absolutely believe that from day one, the Democrats in the House have got to come out with a progressive agenda that speaks to the needs of working people. And that leads to — as you know, the Medicare-for-all bill I introduced, which is to be implemented over four years, lowers the eligibility age from 65 to 55, covers all of the children, and lowers the cost of prescription drugs. My guess is that about 80-percent of the American people would support a proposal like that. It’s wildly popular. And that’s what the Democrats have got to do. They’ve got to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour, they’ve got to make public colleges tuition-free and they’ve got to lower student debt. All of these proposals are enormously popular. And they’re good public policy. And here’s what I think, Matt, that maybe nobody else in the world believes. As you know, Trump is a 100-percent political opportunist, who has no political views other than how he can win elections.

> **Well, that’s true.**
Today, if he is a racist and a sexist, tomorrow he may be a great civil rights champion — if he thinks it gets him five more votes. He has no core values. I would not be shocked that if the Democrats passed popular, good legislation, that Trump would look around him and say, “Hey, why not? What do I give a damn?” And he may come on board, because ultimately he doesn’t believe in anything except winning. So I believe it’s terribly important that the Democrats come out of the gate full-steam ahead and start passing really good legislation that puts Trump and the Republicans on the defensive.

> **So far what I’ve been reading about the intention of the Democrats in the House is that much of it is focused on investigations; we have 64 subpoenas we want to drop, and —**
Wrong!

> **Wrong?**
Look, people can chew bubble gum and walk at the same time. Democrats can do that. And if all they’re going to do is investigate Trump, that would be, in my view a very, very serious mistake. I think finally we are going to have oversight over Trump’s behavior. And I think investigations are absolutely appropriate. But simultaneously, people who are making $11 an hour are not worrying about investigations. People who have no health care, or can’t afford prescription drugs, are not worried about subpoenas. People who can’t afford to send their kids to college are not worried about another investigation. So it would be a tragic mistake in my view if all the Democrats did is focus on investigations. They must, must, must go forward with a progressive agenda to win the support of the American people.

> **Because —**
Because it’s not an either/or. Investigation, oversight: terribly important. But they have got to come forward with a progressive agenda for working people.

> **And they have to do that, presumably, before the 2020 presidential race begins?**
They have to do it on day one. They can start working on it. I’ll work with them. But we’ve got to do that on day one.",TheSwampDweller,e9d8g90,SandersForPresident

We are in a situation where we have not been since the late 1920s, before the Depression, where the top 1% owns 38% of the financial wealth of America, while the bottom 60% – six zero – owns 2.3% of the wealth in America. That is obscene beyond belief. 95% of all new income in this country went to the top 1%.

>  It is very dangerous to our political system. Because big money interests are putting huge amounts of money into the political process through Citizens United.

"Big picture: The Medicaid expansion has gone from covering fewer than half the states to covering almost four-fifths.

The lesson? When it comes to health care, voters value a program that is broad and simple. They want premiums and deductibles and other forms of cost-sharing to be minimized. And they'd rather avoid the grind of dealing with the insurance market. They just want security and reliability. That's the sort of policy they will reward at the polls.

That is, of course, a case for continuing to expand Medicaid. But it's also a case for Medicare-for-all, which would provide all those benefits to every single American voter.

[Here are the rules of this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandersforpresident/wiki/rules) you violated with this part of your post:

Rule 1: Be Civil
- Because you called me 'juvenile and out-of-touch'

Rule 2: No Trolling (This includes any user who come comes to /r/SandersForPresident to be repetitively disagreeable)
- Because your point was already made by another user, and then you doubled down **without contributing anything**
>  ^ 5-day-old account with autogenerated username and one “what about liberals!”-style post

Rule 3: Unproductive, Off-Topic and Low-Context Submissions
- Because **I'm a real user** your comment is most certainly Unproductive, Off-Topic and Low-Context

Rule 7: Conspiracy Theories and Fear Mongering Are Prohibited (The following is prohibited: Any post or public statement which spreads fear, intimidation, or unease but either has no direct or clear benefit to the greater goals of the sub or is intended to coerce subscribers into behaving or engaging in any way that they would not have done otherwise.)
- The only way to interpret your post is that I'm not a genuine person, and I'm part of a 'troll farm' somewhere. You're trying to convince people to be **afraid** I'm not legitimate, in order to discredit my posts without actually addressing them directly. 


> Nope. Ad hominem means it's baseless. I already mentioned what I based it on - the similarity of your account to others known to be illegitimate. If you are legitimate, sorry.

You should be sorry. [Ad hominem](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ad%20hominem) does not mean it's baseless:

1 : appealing to feelings or prejudices rather than intellect
an ad hominem argument

2 : marked by or being an attack on an opponent's character rather than by an answer to the contentions made
made an ad hominem personal attack on his rival

> the similarity of your account to others known to be illegitimate.

You've provided **ABSOLUTELY** no proof of this. It's based on your opinion, and you're putting me in a bucket with other people you disagree with because it's easier than discussing facts or providing evidence. It's disgusting. 

I'll mention there is a caveat in the rules regarding new accounts. The problem is you're not applying any scrutiny **you're just flat out saying I'm illegitimate because of my opinion, and account age.**

>the resentment that Trump obviously had toward Sessions is that he recused himself in terms of the Mueller investigation, which was the right thing to do. And Trump never forgave him. The key question right now is whether or not Trump will attempt to impede the Mueller investigation. And that must not be allowed to happen. Congress has got to pass legislation to protect that investigation. However, if Trump goes forward and tries to impede it, that is in my mind an obstruction of justice, which is an impeachable offense. So we have to do everything we can in every way to make sure that investigation goes forward.

"I don't think Sherrod is exciting enough for a nationwide race. 

I still think it will even be tough for him to win Ohio against Trump. 

It looked as though there were 185k more votes for Sherrod than his opponent. But those numbers don't match for the governors race. Republicans missed an opportunity to steal Sherrod's seat. They were so focused on the governor's race, they didn't have a strong candidate. Mandel dropping out was bad, but he was bad in the first place. If they had Mary Taylor run for senate instead of governor, I think it would've been a lot closer. She had support during the primary and was Kasich's LT governor. 

That being said. There is a lot that goes into a presidental run that Bernie has been laying the groundwork for 2 years. Sherrod outside of Ohio is a problem. Beto is interesting. But a Sanders/O'Rourke ticket would still have the same issues that Sanders/(White Person) will have. It would make sense to have a Sanders/Gabbard or Sanders/Turner.",OMG_its_JasonE,e9d2n6d,SandersForPresident
"Ohio went blue for Obama both times he ran. Hillary had a load of baggage with NAFTA, taking the rust belt and the whole Midwest for granted (especially Michigan and Wisconsin I’d say) and combating a (faux) populist message from trump. Ohio is not a dyed in the wool red state like Wyoming or Montana ",Abuddend,e9c79r0,SandersForPresident
"I think that is because Sherrod Brown is actually well liked in Ohio. He is seen as a working man moderate when his voting record is actually won if the most liberal out there. In a state full of people that increasingly views the Democratic party as looking down on them, Ohioans see him as someone who understands them. 

That being said, I'm gonna say hell no on Gabbard. Literally the only reason why people support her here is that she endorsed Bernie in 2016. Her foreign policy views are absolutely godawful. She opposed the Iran deal, is obsessed with ""radical Islam"" and was one of the few Democrats who said we needed to emphasize the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" more,  she is an Assad apologist who has said she was skeptical he was behind the chemical attacks, and she has supported a number of the increasing number of far-right world leaders.

She has refused to debate opponents in primary debates (something she criticized Clinton for doing) and I don't trust her on abortion and LGBT rights saying that ""As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists."" In her defense, she  has ""changed"" her views recently. I put that in quotes because what she actually said is that her views remain the same, just that she no longer believes the government should enforce her views. I may accept that from someone on the right, but not from someone who claims to be a progressive.

I don't know enough about Turner, but I don't think ""Endorsed Bernie in 2016"" is the key qualifier for someone to be a running mate. They need to bring something else to the table that Bernie does not, which is why I think a combined progressive/moderate ticket could do the job.",pyrojoe121,e9d6fut,SandersForPresident
"Obama was a once in a lifetime candidate. 

Obama x2, Strickland x1, Brown x2. In last 3 major elections that’s all the Dems won. We haven’t had a single Democrat win statewide, non judicial race, since 2010. 

The house and senate are both republican supermajority. 

Supreme Court is 5-2 Republican. Was 6-1 previously. 

Congress is 12-4 Republican.

Being against bombing the middle east is a great position and I support anyone who holds that position.

"As you like it, I again refer to my comment concerning gerrymandering, voter suppression etc etc. all those give the Republicans an edge in Ohio, especially at the state level as they do in many states where Republicans hold undue sway. 

Nationally, which is a fair assumption since this is Sanders for President, Ohio has and can go blue. 2016 was hardly typical considering the candidates and circumstances. ",Abuddend,e9c91g4,SandersForPresident

Kentucky might have more of a chance but I can’t speak more authoritatively on it. 

The fact is that Ohio is a battleground state for a reason, a bellwether state, and often is a linchpin for Republican candidates. Calling it solid red ignores its history, demographics and diversity. I certainly understand the frustration felt by liberals and progressives here, being one.

You can’t ignore it and giving it up isn’t wise. I don’t claim it’d be easy, but I think it is an important state for any candidate to win. ",Abuddend,e9cuqsz,SandersForPresident
"It's a battleground state because people keep saying it and ignoring the results of the last 10 years. Just because Obama won 10 years ago while every single other election has been red, doesn't make it a blue state. 

I'm not saying give up on Ohio, but the path to 270 doesn't go through Ohio for any democratic candidate. Bernie knows it. Which is why he hasn't been here that much in the last 2 years. 

There is a chance. I'm not giving up, but 2020 is too soon for Ohio to turn blue again. We need a complete overhaul of the state party.  
The county parties need strengthened. But that won't happen in the next 10 years. ",OMG_its_JasonE,e9cv2dh,SandersForPresident

Bernie: ""Trump became president because he won the Electoral College in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Well, three out of four of those states elected Democratic governors, and all four of those states elected Democratic United States Senators. So I think Trump's victories in those very important states may not be longstanding.""

Democrats lost on Thursday by 180,000 votes. That's not insurmountable. It will be tough, yes, but Bernie doesn't think 2020 is too soon for Ohio to turn blue again with the right message. ",RanLearns,e9d7xne,SandersForPresident

Trump has been here 3 times in the last 3 months. 

180k is a lot. And that was a ""wave"" election. So the best shot the Dems could take left them 180k short. Previous elections it was 400k. 

Primary wise, Ohio probably won't be a high value state, so Bernie likely won't be here a lot. So it will be left to the State party, which is trash.

I said it before and I will say it again. If Bernie doesn't pick an AA running mate, he won't have a chance in Ohio. White male vs white male in this state is a loss every time for Dems.

"I think this article is worthless.  I get that voter suppression is a big deal.  

But IMO there's no reason to think a medicare for all - national ID would fix the issue.  

First, we have plenty of situations where ID's are around and it doesn't translate to automatic registration.  In most states, getting a drivers license, or getting a student ID, or getting a military ID, or enrolling in a government program all don't lead to automatic voter registration.  

Second - while I think in most states voter registration is about making it harder to vote - it does serve two other purposes:

* Validating that you're eligible to vote - a national ID might help to some extent here - who you are, but each state sets their own eligibility requirement, but that's not to say red states wouldn't put in a difficult process past the national ID to prove you're eligible to vote - ie proving you're a citizen and non-felon (if ID's are given to non citizens).

* Validating your address (where you vote) - Again - a national ID might be nice to have, but what happens when you move?  Do you get your ID updated each and every time?  How difficult is this process?  Again - having a national ID that doesn't reflect your current address just seems like another reason red states could make up to invalidate voter registration.  


I think it's a giant leap to assume that medicare for all = national ID's for all, and that every red state will all the sudden adopt automatic voter registration and make it easy to vote with that national ID.  ",etown361,e9agkdp,SandersForPresident

Medicare is presently funded by payroll taxes.  Everybody who has a job pays - starting with dollar one.  Not just the rich.  According to Sanders, it will be an additional 11.5% payroll tax.

Add this to the existing SS, DI and other payroll taxes and you will be getting close to 25%.  Think most people would stand for it?  Half of households furrently pay zero income tax.  How many would turn Republican when they see their 40K become 30K?

$3.2 trillion per year?  That's pretty much the entire amount of income taxes collected by the IRS annually.  So one could fund Medicare For All with income taxes, just take your tax bill and double it.

In 2015 Vermont looked at single payer - at an additional 12.5% payroll tax plus another 9.5 % state income tax, and balked. Vermont's plan was not as generous as the M4A plan by Sanders.

The thing that the third way Democrats are better than is the Republicans, even the Republicans in the 'far left' of the Republican party (the term 'far left' is used somewhat sardonically here).

"I think gun control is a losing issue relentlessly pushed by a corporate media that benefits from the constant conflict. Two things:

1. Cities with the strictest gun control laws have the highest incidents of violent crime (New York, Chicago, & Los Angeles). 

2. The government has never successfully banned anything. In fact, Prohibition only leads to lower prices and more supply.

Common sense things like the universal background checks and closing the gun show loophole make sense to me, but I don't know how anyone thinks a billion firearms will just disappear when the government decides. I don't see the benefit in pretending like black markets don't exist.

">I am glad to hear that voters in three states voted to legalize marijuana, and one voted to decriminalize it outright. Millions of Americans have had their lives impacted by the federal prohibition on marijuana – arrests, convictions and even jail time. Even when people don’t go to jail, the criminal record they receive makes it harder for them to find a job, get housing or go to college. These harmful impacts are felt far more acutely in communities of color and poor communities because enforcement of marijuana laws is much stricter there than in more affluent, white communities. African Americans are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana even though marijuana usage rates are basically the same across racial lines. Of course, marijuana prohibition is part of a larger failed war on drugs that has led to the great national crisis of mass incarceration. Some 1.5 million people were arrested for a drug related offense in 2016 – over 80 percent of which were for possession alone. We need to stop criminalizing addiction. We need to stop criminalizing recreational marijuana use. The actions voters made in states across the nation are a step in the right direction.

>1. The growing disparity in income and wealth that exists in America. We are in a situation where we have not been since the late 1920s, before the Depression, where the top 1% owns 38% of the financial wealth of America, while the bottom 60% – six zero – owns 2.3% of the wealth in America. That is obscene beyond belief. 95% of all new income in this country went to the top 1%.

1. The system is corrupted by 'corporate shills' who masquerade as liberals within the Democratic party
2. Voting for these 'corporate shills' props up the current system, which is rotten to the core. This kicks the can down the road, until 'Hitler 2.0' gets a chance to abuse the rotten system.
3. Voting for Trump won't lead to 'Hitler 2.0', but his well-spoken successor could be if we don't address the corruption and reign in executive privilege/power

I would be willing to vote for a 3rd party, but I won't choose not to vote. The Democrats by and large are part of a 'liberal bubble' which needs to be shattered so we can move forward, I'm sorry if the hammer to do that is Trump. I hope it isn't.

If you ever need a reminder that the CIA was founded and run by lawyers, you won't need to look any further than the overthrow of Guatemalan democracy. The Dulles brothers were partners in the Wall Street law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell; time permitting, they also worked for the US government. With John Foster Dulles heading the State Department and Allen Dulles heading the CIA, they were the czars of Eisenhower's foreign policy, and they made sure that the interests of Sullivan & Cromwell clients weren't ignored.
In 1951, Jacobo Arbenz was elected president of Guatemala by a landslide in a free and fair election. He hoped to transform Guatemala ""from a backward country with a predominantly feudal economy to a modern capitalist state."" The CIA, however, weighed in heavily on the side of feudalism.

When Arbenz appropriated some unused land controlled by the Rockefeller-owned United Fruit Company (for which United Fruit was duly compensated), the company undertook an extensive PR campaign in the US, designed to paint Arbenz as a tool of the ""international Communist conspiracy."" John Foster Dulles, ever alert for opportunities to roll back the red menace-and to help out a valued client-convinced Ike that Arbenz must go. [By the way, ""United Fruit Company"" is the actual origin of the term, ""Banana Republic.""]

Brother Allen's CIA was only too happy to take the job, which ended up costing only about $20 million. The agency sponsored a propaganda offensive and hired about 300 mercenaries who sporadically sabotaged trains and oil supplies.


Finally, in June of 1954, unmarked CIA planes staged a series of air raids on the Guatemalan capital and dropped leaflets demanding Arbenz's resignation. At the same time, CIA-run radio stations warned of the impending invasion of an occupying rebel army (actually the agency's 300 hired thugs). Considering discretion the better part of valor, Arbenz fled, leaving Guatemala in the hands of the CIA's hand-picked stooge, General Castillo Armas.

The CIA has always been particularly proud of the Guatemalan operation, which inaugurated a series of bloodthirsty regimes that murdered more than 100,000 Guatemalans over the next 40 years. In retrospect, however, some CIA veterans concluded that it may have come off too easily, leading to a certain overconfidence. **As one CIA officer put it, ""We thought we could knock off these little brown people on the cheap.""**

>1. The growing disparity in income and wealth that exists in America. We are in a situation where we have not been since the late 1920s, before the Depression, where the top 1% owns 38% of the financial wealth of America, while the bottom 60% – six zero – owns 2.3% of the wealth in America. That is obscene beyond belief. 95% of all new income in this country went to the top 1%.

>  It is very dangerous to our political system. Because big money interests are putting huge amounts of money into the political process through Citizens United. And these are issues that have got to be addressed, or else in my view the United States will move very rapidly toward an oligarchic form of society when our economic and political life is controlled by a handful of billionaires.

"Why does it seem like so many people in their 30s *hate* Bernie Sanders? I was just talking to a guy tonight who started going off about how ""the primary wasn't rigged! Nothing illegal happened with the HVF, plus Hillary won the Washington primary but Bernie got all the delegates!"" seemingly out of nowhere, and he only got saltier and saltier as time went on. I see this happen time and time again, and it's only with people in that age group. Older people could not give a shit about this ""feud"", and younger people are enthusiastically for Sanders and don't even bring up Hillary. But I always run into people in their 30s with a deep seated loathing for him, even 2 years later. Why? My theory is that it's because they were in high school during the Clinton era so they just absolutely love her, but I'm not sure.",nxqv,e97l4bx,SandersForPresident
"probably because they fell for the blaming of sanders for Hillary's loss.  it is extremely delusional.  you blame the person on the ballot.  she lost the most winnable election in American history.  and the mainstream media and the other sycophants spent two years pointing fingers.  if that isn't a sign that they are on the wrong side of history i don't know what is.  excuses and changing nothing.  you can't do that after losing to someone like trump.  and you can't blame someone who polled better against trump before and after the election, that also campaigned for you.",StormalongJuan,e98c53t,SandersForPresident

"Guys, make calls! Even if you aren’t from TX. It’s the last major thing you can do to get people to vote for Beto.

A few notes:

1)You don’t have to use your phone. It’s a web app. It’s free.

2) The web app finds people for you, so you don’t have to keep redialing a ton of numbers. 

3) It gives you a script to read. You don’t have to make anything up.

4) At this point in the game it’s JUST getting likely dems to vote. You won’t have to convince anyone, know the local issues, or deal with angry republicans. It’s just asking them to vote.

5) It’s so easy that I can multi task low priority stuff at work while I’m waiting for the auto dials to get the next person on the phone. 

6) It works. I got 3 people to make a plan to vote in 30 mins. I spent 3 hours canvassing yesterday for the same results.

I've showed them speeches by Beto and tried to explain to them his message as best I can, and they have turned in their opinion of him quite a bit, but it always come back to abortion.

The chances of them actually being Democrats that voted agains their party for Trump was pretty slim, those were probably people that were ""having trouble deciding"" aka Bernie supporters that were actually Republicans. 

The game these days is divide and conquer. Both party's loyals will split to their side and then the propaganda can work to try and sway those few left without a ""side"".

"I didn't used to, but it's become increasingly more clear in the decade since I reached adulthood that the Republican party is objectively more evil and blatantly corrupt than the Democrats.

If you consider actual criminal indictments of just members of the executive branch over the past ~50 years, the Republicans have over 150 to the Democrats' 19. That's *8 times* as many.

Reagan's trickle-down bullshit that the right has been pushing despite clear failure for over 30 years is directly responsible for the fact that the ""richest nation on earth"" has more poverty and wealth inequality than almost any of its peers. 

The right ignores and denies science and pushes hypocritical theocratic bullshit all the time.

The right wing creates international enemies and more terrorism through their neoconservative global conquests.

The right promotes corporate freedoms while stifling individual freedoms.

The right has been selling out working Americans for personal gain for decades.

I could go on and on, but the point is that while the Democrats certainly have rampant corruption in their ranks, there are a steadily growing number of decent, pro-middle class anti-corporatist Democrats. On the other hand, the Republicans cannot reject corruption at this point because they have literally incorporated it into the philosophy of their party. Their slogans and soundbites are designed to make their voters comfortable with giving up their power and money so that corporate interests may have more of it. We spent more on corporate welfare for the rich than we do on social welfare for the poor.

""Both sides are the same"" is literally right-wing propaganda designed to keep disillusioned liberals home on voting day. Republicans, no matter how vile their candidates are, don't get disillusioned because they've been brainwashed for decades that liberals are America's #1 enemy, and they should vote for a massively corrupt Republican over a spooky, evil ""communist"" liberal.

"Funny how you resort to twisting my words around into a strawman.

No, my solution is not not voting.

I'm refuting the naive concept that voting solves all problems, that voting is the end all to everything, that all it takes is voting, that ""What happens next is all up to us,"" because it's not all fucking up to us. If you're black, and in the South, there's a good fucking chance that white republicans are fucking you over, more so than you would be if you were black anywhere else in the US. 

As I already mentioned:

* We vote, but the popular vote isn't how we pick a president.
* We vote, but states have winner-take-all, which means your vote is invalidated no matter if you're republican or democrat.
* We vote, but our votes are invalidated and replaced with representative votes in the electoral college.
* We vote, and states like Vermont where the popular vote went for Bernie but all the superdelagate votes went for fucking HRC.

See my point?? It's that it takes more than ""just voting"" to make a difference. I don't know what it takes, maybe it takes more money, or special interest, or getting more people to vote or god fucking forbid it takes violence to make change; I don't know. But what I do know is that it takes more than one fucking vote to make a difference. It takes more than an entire state voting one way to make a difference. It takes more...when you're up against lying/cheating republicans along with your own party who fucked you over in 2016 to push their own agenda.",Cool_Bastard,e92upzd,SandersForPresident
"You’re not wrong but sometimes talking like that causes people to stay home on Election Day, because why make the effort if it doesn’t work anyway?

So I agree with you... but I personally refrain from downplaying the importance of voting to people on the fence because I don’t want to discourage anybody.

Changes do need to be made, but between now and Tuesday there’s a 0% chance of that happening so we just need to play the hand we’re dealt for now.",preventDefault,e92uzcz,SandersForPresident
">sometimes talking like that causes people to stay home on Election Day, because why make the effort if it doesn’t work anyway?

I can't argue with that. The only change is to emphasize what I said, which was, "" **It's that it takes more than ""just voting"" to make a difference.**"" I guess I should say that voting is the very least that we can do, along with checking with our friends to make sure they are voting. I go to random blacks at work (yes I know it's weird, but it's doubly important for them) and ask if they vote. Hispanics as well (since I am half Mexican). Many. Still. Aren't/Haven't. Voted. I urge them to vote.  

>So I agree with you.

And I guess I agree with you too, that we all need to vote. 

>between now and Tuesday there’s a 0% chance of that happening so we just need to play the hand we’re dealt for now.

You are right. I just....I just hate what's fucking going on. I'm seething with it. Fuming with endless, impotent, rage at the right & Trump supporters and what the DNC has done. We're fractured...and if we don't pull together this week, and in 2020...I got nothing.

>The documents also show that the Kochs...target voters with **tailored messaging on select issues, and partner with cable and satellite TV providers to play those tailored messages during “regular” television broadcasts**.

****

>In modern elections, **incorporating AI into voter file maintenance has become a prerequisite to producing reliable data.** The Kochs’ political data firm, **i360 states that it has “been practicing AI for years. Our team of data scientists uses components of Machine learning, Deep Learning and Predictive Analytics, every day as they build and refine our predictive models.**”

>The Kochs and i360

>The **Kochs formally entered the data space nine years ago, developing the “Themis Trust” program for the 2010 midterms** — an uncommonly impactful election cycle where **Republican operatives executed their REDMAP program and algorithmically gerrymandered congressional maps across the country in their favor.**

>In 2011, the **Kochs folded Themis into a data competitor it acquired, i360 LLC, which was founded by Michael Palmer, the former chief technology officer of Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign**. Palmer still leads the organization.

>...the **Kochs’ long-term funding commitments to i360 allowed the organization to think bigger than their political competitors.**

>“Right now, we’re talking about and building things that you won’t see in 2016, because it’s not going to be ready until 2018,” Michael Palmer said in the wake of the 2014 midterm cycle.

>Conservatives agree that the Kochs are subsidizing i360. The losses they sustain by undercharging clients, however, are a pittance compared to the down-stream public policy returns and political power the Kochs receive from operating what amounts to a shadow political party in the United States — **one that vigilantly guards the fossil fuel subsidies, deregulatory schemes, and regressive tax structures that enable Koch Industries to bring in $115 billion annually in private revenue.**

****

>Inside the i360 Voter File

>**i360 knows what your financial standing is.**

>i360 has also created a set of 70 “clustercodes” to humanize its data for campaign operatives. These categories range from **“Faded Blue Collars” to “Meandering Millennials,” and have flamboyant descriptions that correspond with their attribute headings.**

****

>Here are some examples:

>i360 Clustercodes

>Koch Persuasion Models

>Additionally, i360 has developed a series of **persuasion models for its voter file. These models are often regionally sensitive — since voters have regional concerns — and are being used in federal elections and down-ballot races** to assist Republicans across the country.

>In 2016,** i360 created a set of regional models while working with Sen. Rob Portman’s 2016 re-election campaign in Ohio.** Portman started out the race polling nine points behind his Democratic opponent, Gov. Ted Strickland, but ultimately won with 58 percent of the vote.

>The company **developed a model that could predict whether a voter supported Portman or Strickland with 89 percent accuracy,** and others that predicted voter policy preferences. Well aware of the 2016 landscape, **i360 also made a Trump/Clinton model, an Anti-Hillary model, and a Ticket Splitter model.**

>Much of i360’s success in the race, however, **was linked to understanding (after conducting extensive polling) that a “key local issue facing Ohio was the opioid epidemic.” In response, the company created a “heroin model” and a “heroin treatment model” that were particularly effective at convincing voters to support Portman.**

>i360 Heroin Model

>...**Portman’s “position” on the crisis depended on the voter, emphasizing health care solution communications for some, and criminal justice solution communications for others.**

****

>...manipulation of the opioid crisis for political gain has a perverse irony given the Kochs’ long-running work to **provide corporate interests, including health care and pharmaceutical interests, with undue political power and influence over public policy decisions.** The Kochs have gifted over a **million dollars to ALEC, for example, an organization that counts Purdue Pharma — the unconscionable manufacturer of OxyContin — as a member.**

>The company also stated **it joined Portman’s campaign 21 months before the election, and that, “Together, i360 and the campaign strategized a plan to execute one of the most custom-targeted, integrated campaigns to date with a focus on getting the right message to the right voter wherever that might be.**”

>...**during the 2016 election, i360 also ran $11.7 million worth of “independent” expenditures for the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, Freedom Partners Action Fund, and Americans for Prosperity in Portman’s race.**

>These outside spenders, two of which are Koch-funded groups, **and Portman’s campaign all used i360 to coordinate their digital marketing, phone banks and television ad buys, in the same market, in the same election.**

>Voters are looking for answers. They are just beginning to be introduced to bold ideas like Medicare for All and tuition-free college. That agenda needs to be expanded—and defended. In Congress, anything that passes from a Democratic-controlled House will die in the Republican Senate, so progressives should use the opportunity to hold hearings that detail bold reforms, and pass “message bills” that frame the alternative. Similarly, at the state and local level, progressives should use advances to drive bold reforms on everything from big money in politics and holding corporations accountable, to criminal justice reform. One focus should be on the jobs and growth that can be generated by public investment in a [Green New Deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkTTHop3DiI&feature=youtu.be&t=176), modernizing America while rebuilding it. Progressives should be pushing at every level to empower workers—and to curb a perverted capitalism that rewards CEOs for plundering their own companies.

>This year’s elections gave lie to those fanning fears that progressives would tear the party apart by challenging favored establishment choices. Fierce arguments over policies and primary challenges did not hinder coming together in unity against Trump and his Republican enablers. Movements—from #MeToo to Black Lives Matter to the Dreamers to the stunning teacher strikes in red states—helped move opinion, not alienate it. Bold ideas like Medicare for All grew more popular, not less, even under scabrous Republican attacks. Progressives have made great advances over the last two years.

When the people build enough power, and weakened by regular ranching practices like 'penning' & 'milking', soon our production capacity is eyed by feral fear and we're defenseless. As the cruel & cowardly minority gorges they become more powerful. Today is our chance to turn around, square off, and strike hard. We must empower and connect every day, but today is all or nothing. This is a solid line in the dark. Step forth, stand tall, be the authority.  

What heartens me is envisioning a hundred million Americans lining up at community centers all around the nation as our sun passes overhead.

>* a 15-dollar-an-hour minimum wage
>* criminal justice and immigration reform 

>have gained ever-greater traction within the party. More and more Democratic candidates found it necessary to forgo taking corporate PAC money, even as small-donor contributions soared. Progressives will win victories up and down the ballot on Tuesday. The signature upsets of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley over Democratic incumbents put the rest of the party on notice...   

>Sanders has broken new ground by laying out elements of an alternative foreign policy position...   

>The economy still doesn’t work for working people. Inequality grows worse; political corruption deepens; endless wars continue without victory, real security threats like catastrophic climate change are ignored...   

>A restoration candidate gives Trump a stronger hand, allowing him to cast himself once more as the populist agent of change against an entrenched and failed establishment. And even if successful in ridding us of Trump, the result would be a Democratic administration that will once more fail working people, a failure that will surely feed an even uglier political reaction...  

>Voters are looking for answers. They are just beginning to be introduced to bold ideas like Medicare for All and tuition-free college. That agenda needs to be expanded—and defended. In Congress, anything that passes from a Democratic-controlled House will die in the Republican Senate, so progressives should use the opportunity to hold hearings that detail bold reforms, and pass “message bills” that frame the alternative. Similarly, at the state and local level, progressives should use advances to drive bold reforms on everything from big money in politics and holding corporations accountable, to criminal justice reform. One focus should be on the jobs and growth that can be generated by public investment in a [Green New Deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkTTHop3DiI&feature=youtu.be&t=176), modernizing America while rebuilding it. Progressives should be pushing at every level to empower workers—and to curb a perverted capitalism that rewards CEOs for plundering their own companies.

>This year’s elections gave lie to those fanning fears that progressives would tear the party apart by challenging favored establishment choices. Fierce arguments over policies and primary challenges did not hinder coming together in unity against Trump and his Republican enablers. Movements—from #MeToo to Black Lives Matter to the Dreamers to the stunning teacher strikes in red states—helped move opinion, not alienate it. Bold ideas like Medicare for All grew more popular, not less, even under scabrous Republican attacks. Progressives have made great advances over the last two years. Now is the time to push harder, to challenge those standing in the way, and to build not a restoration, but the political revolution that has just begin.

If I already own multiple firearms why do I need to wait 10 days to get a new one? 

>•67% of the people polled by Quinnipiac support a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons...

The only 'assault' weapons you can buy now are worth around 40,000.00$. They are grandfathered in. You can not buy a new production assault weapon as a normal individual. 

>•87% support laws to prevent convicted felons and the mentally ill from owning guns...

If you are a convicted felon you can not own a gun legally. I am fairly certain being accepted into a mental health facility will disqualify you as well.

>•71% support banning anyone under 21 from buying a gun...

You can vote at 18, join the military, and be tried in court as an adult. Why shouldn't they be allowed to own a firearm at 18?

>•63% support a ban on the sale and possession of high capacity magazines...

""High capacity"" magazines are usually 'standard capacity'. A 30 round magazine isn't ""high capacity"". Anyone who trains with firearms knows a capacity limit will only make you carry more magazines are reload more often, which is going to set you back almost nothing. I feel like this is a general misconception about firearms. 

>•57% support an assault weapons ban...

But there is one in place, I can not buy an assault weapon unless I have 40,000$ or so to buy a pre-ban one.

>•56% say that stricter guns laws would reduce gun related deaths...

I mean isn't that more of an opinion? 

>•Universal background checks...

Every time you buy a firearm there is a NCIC check to see if you are a felon. 

>•Ending the so called 'Gunshow Loophole'...

If you buy a gun at a gun show you are ran through NCIC. 

>•Any American that is suffering today from a mental health crisis should be able to get the mental health care they need now, not two months from now...

I agree.

>•If somebody is a stalker, if somebody is convicted of domestic violence, if somebody is under a restraining order... that person should not be owning a gun...

I believe a protection order against you revokes your right to own a gun. 

I don't think much of this is 'common sense'. Most people who talk about this stuff have not bought a gun or own one themselves. The only true thing any of this will do is hurt legal gun owners. A lot of gun violence and 'mass shootings' are gang related and involve pistols. However I don't hear anyone talking about a pistol ban.

Yes I voted for Bernie, and I would probably do it again. His state of Vermont just passed a magazine capacity limit law, and they are already the state with the -least- amount of violent crime. I really wish people would stop demonizing gun owners and the hobby. I enjoy old military rifles but enjoy my more modern ones as well. A lot of these 'laws' would only hurt the ability to collect interesting pieces of engineering and enjoy them in a safe manner. The majority of gun owners are law abiding citizens.

"Well, no, the *most* radical leftists are Tankies. It's just that there are only three of them and they don't typically go on killing sprees. That, and most of us are perfectly happy to acknowledge both that tankies are leftists and that they're worrisome radicals, and if they existed in numbers, there'd be just as much effort toward curbing them as toward any other violent radicals.

And *that's* the key difference. Not only aren't there terrorists running around spouting our exact rhetoric, but, also, we recognize dangerous extremism when we see it and we don't *care* whose team it purports to be a part of.

Republicans right now are perfectly happy to ally with the alt-right, to let them run wild with the Republican Party itself, but they don't want political violence in the party. But political violence is happening, and the people doing it are Republicans. Since they can't ascribe it to the alt-right, on account of they're in coalition and they don't want the guilt-by-association, they attribute it to individuals as though their ""political"" beliefs were irrelevant and the violence took place in a vacuum.",TheChance,e91wqil,SandersForPresident

One was the standoff at **Ruby Ridge**, Idaho, in 1992, where a right-wing activist resisting federal weapons charges moved with his family to a remote cabin, leading to an 11-day armed standoff with authorities. The other was the 51-day standoff in **Waco, Texas**, between a Christian cult and police, which led to the deaths of more than 80 people, including 22 children.

"> We don't try to take people's cars because there are DUIs and reckless drivers after all.

I've got a question for you then...why don't we have a 'Gun Owners Ed' class that people have to take before operating a gun, like we do cars? Why do we not require a license before operating a gun, just like we do every other thing out there potentially dangerous to those around you? You need a gun to drive a car, to operate heavy machinery, to fly an airplane. And those licenses can be taken away if you are shown to be reckless with it. What makes guns so special?

And don't quote 2nd Amendment at me. That's an outdated rule created during times where the situations are not AT ALL similar. It's not written in stone.

If you can't defend the 'right to bear arms' with logic that makes sense *today* without resorting to 'because the Founders *told* me I could do it'...then the Amendment is indefensible and should be updated or removed.

Most of them have never fired a gun before let alone held one.

My dad's a collector and spent years as the sharp-shooter instructor for his Reserve unit (among others). I've made sure that my kids have had firearm instruction.

You know what all that time around firearms has taught me? That they are WEAPONS - they are not 'tools'. THEY ARE WEAPONS. Their design and purpose is to kill things. Yes, most people only 'kill' paper or clay targets, but it doesn't change the fact that a gun has no other purpose of design than to kill. Even a knife is designed for cooking or carving rather than killing. Calling them a 'tool' does not come near affording them the respect they are due. It demeans them into something they are not and convinces people that they are not needing that respect. You can wave a hammer around in the air without killing anyone. You can shove it down your pants as a 'holster' without blowing your nuts off. You can wave it in someone's face without potentially killing them. It can be tossed in the air and - while it may hurt someone if you're stupid enough to not watch where you throw it - it's unlikely to *kill* anyone. THAT is a tool. If you wave a gun around in the air, you're a homicidal moron. If you fire them in the air without thinking of where the bullet will land, you're a homicidal moron. A gun is NOT a 'tool'. It is a weapon. Which brings up:

> it is nothing more then an extension of a human who has a will to do something.

Nope. It's a weapon. That moron waving it around or firing it into the air may not 'have a will' to kill anyone, but he might very well kill someone anyway. The toddler wandering around in her parent's bedroom may not 'have a will' to commit suicide, but that won't stop her from being dead from finding her parent's gun.  And before you come back with 'a knife lying around could kill her, too' - yes, but not as easily. And she's much more likely to cut a hand first and drop the knife - minor wound instead of fatal. Even if she fell with the knife, the wound is much less likely to be as severe as a gunshot would be.

A gun is the only weapon that is just as likely to cause a fatal *accident* as it is to be used purposefully to kill. A gun is the only weapon offered for private ownership that can be used to kill dozens from a distance - removing any chance of the potential victims fighting back. A gun deserves the respect of being regulated to the point that people REALIZE the respect it deserves. ",wdjm,e90zud4,SandersForPresident

By explicitly declining to name a specific source, I hope to skip the part where people ask if we can *really* trust [the CIA/the UN/the World Bank/the Canadian government/insert source for macro-level statistics].

So thumb through homicide figures in Western/ized nations with and without strong gun control laws. You'll find they're 60-75% lower.

To me, this suggests that in 2/3-3/4 of cases where a person might shoot someone else or themselves, they are not prepared to do it in a more physical manner. It's both easier to shoot someone impulsively and easier to shoot someone *period*. It's a comparatively disengaged way to attack a person, and it doesn't require any physical strength, dexterity, or stamina, aside from aiming well.

And if that is indeed true in a decisive majority of cases, it speaks for itself.

"Well that’s a great point, but you do have to admit that despite the trans/gay views, Shapiro is an excellent Conservative Political philosopher. He’s very smart, and he does his research thoroughly. Live debates do sometimes work in Ben’s favor, but I disagree that it’s a bad way to disseminate political information. Look at the [Ben Shapiro v Cenk Uygr debate](https://youtu.be/8ko0DVJkLG0) and tell me it wasn’t a huge win for Ben (ignore the stupid cheering and team sports the crowd is getting involved in - ugh). This was a good debate. And live debates are an excellent litmus test for figuring out if political pundits actually know what they’re talking about.",KamaCosby,e91ejer,SandersForPresident
"Literally the very first position Shapiro takes in that video is ideology with a false choice. Affordable universal high quality health care exists in the real world now. Just not in the US. He's making the classic market worshiping mistake of equating cost with quality. The two are not tightly coupled. The greatest medical advancements of the 20th century were cheap and made widely available. Namely antibiotics and vaccines. 

Oh and then he trotted out the 'gun to the head of a doctor' line. Useful idiot ideologue there. Demagogue the position of the opposition with something scary that no one does to drive up fear and make himself sound just. Pathetic rip of Rand Paul's foolishness. No doctor is forced to provide care in universal coverage nations under anything remotely resembling penalty of death. Addled minds spin and believe such nonsense.

I don't know Shapiro other than a few random name drops from right wingers, but the first minute of his speaking alone is enough to toss him aside as an unlikely source of useful insight into prospective policy.",James_GAF,e91g4xk,SandersForPresident

"Emphasis on “I don’t know Shapiro” and the fact that you watched the first minute of his video and threw out the whole thing. And you accuse Shapiro of being an ideologue. 

By the way, the entire point of government is that there is a gun to your head when they force decisions upon you. Not even debatable.

Shapiro loves to immediately dismiss the most convincing and inarguable evidence in the first 10 seconds to minute of his video and he absolutely should be ignored because of it.  His climate change videos are perhaps the most egregious and despicable version of this and no educated, serious person in any intellectual circle holds him up for a reason.",MikeyPWhatAG,e91j5rp,SandersForPresident
"> When a doctor is a government employee under Socialist healthcare, they are forced to work for the government. And the government is the only entity that is allowed to force you to do something.

This shows a complete misunderstanding of the proposed healthcare reform legislation put forward by people on the left like Bernie Sanders. It would provide government-run ***health insurance***, not government-run healthcare. Hospitals and care providers would still be privately-owned. It wouldn't be like the NHS where doctors/nurses/etc. are government employees.",retop56,e91m7je,SandersForPresident

At least Shapiro and Cenk heard each other out instead of sitting in a studio and commenting one-sidedly on a bunch of sound bites. And I don’t mean that with vitriol! I’m just saying you have a great point because it’s not necessarily a good thing when people become informed solely through political theatre.

This is an excellent example of how Obama presidency and Trump's rise has revealed that some of the most vocal critics of GWB were not as progressive as it seems.

Rachael Maddow, Olbermann, and Chris Hayes have long abandoned covering progressive issues as a core part of their platform..  They rarely even talk about Citizen's United anymore. And to be honest, our entire government is taken over by corporate interests. Overturning Citizens United is no where near enough to stop the corporate take over.

">But there’s something wrong with this historical interpretation: **Harry Truman strongly supported single-payer healthcare. Daniel Patrick Moynihan supported a universal basic income in the 1960s. Dating back to World War II, Democrats sought to make a government-paid education available to as many Americans as possible.** If Democrats are marching to the left, that road leads directly back to platforms and politicians who, in their day, commanded wide support and existed firmly in the mainstream of political thought.

>What’s more, to label these programs “socialist”—which is to say, far outside the center of the political spectrum—reveals a constrained worldview. **For over six decades, center-right parties in Europe—in Britain and France, Germany and Austria, and almost everywhere between—have either participated in or acceded to the very same policies.**

.........................................

>**In the 1940s, Senators Robert Wagner and James Murray, and Congressman John Dingell, Sr., introduced legislation that would have established a national program for hospital and medical insurance.** It was stymied by a coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans, as was also the case with Harry Truman’s efforts after 1949 to achieve the same result. But it was central to the party’s core ambition for many years after.

>**Only in the 1960s did Democrats abandon the concept of universal, single-payer health care and champion a narrower program of guaranteed hospital insurance and voluntary medical insurance for the elderly—the program that we now know as Medicare.** They didn’t abandon universal coverage because they viewed it as too radical. Rather, they believed it was no longer necessary. After World War II, major employers began extending unprecedented benefits to workers, including annual cost-of-living adjustments to wages, defined benefits pensions and private health insurance. Given this reality, they turned their focus to a narrower subset of the population that, by definition, would not benefit from employer-based health programs: senior citizens.

>**The same trajectory was generally true of the party’s commitment to ensuring that every family enjoyed an adequate income. Roosevelt’s initial pledge seemed to augur a government-supported basic family wage. In 1946 the Democratic Congress passed—and Harry Truman signed—the Employment Act, which codified the government’s responsibility to “foster and promote free competitive enterprise and the general welfare; conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those able, willing, and seeking to work; and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.” In its original form, the bill would have guaranteed all Americans remunerative work and required the government to create public-sector or private-sector jobs to meet this mandate. In this way, it would have met Roosevelt’s quality of living standard for many families.** Conservatives blocked that provision.

>By the 1960s the American economy seemed so manifestly robust that an income or jobs guarantee no longer seemed necessary. **During his tenure as assistant labor secretary in Lyndon Johnson’s administration, Daniel Moynihan argued for a minimum family income program, to be enforced by means of a negative income tax, but his was a lone voice.** Most liberals believed that if the poorest Americans had access to supplementary job training and education, they would be adequately positioned to capture the benefits of shared prosperity. Interestingly, **the next major figure to take up the idea was no other than Richard Nixon, who as president attempted to overhaul the nation’s welfare system by introducing a family income program.** The idea stalled in Congress, with conservative Republicans opposing it as too generous, and liberal Democrats decrying it as too stingy.

>Still, even into the 1970s, Democrats continued to embrace the idea that government should in some way grant every American a good job and, thereby, income. **In 1977 Democrats in Congress passed the Humphrey-Hawkins Act** - an ambitious proposal reminiscent of the Employment Act. Once again, conservatives watered the bill down such that it lost most of its force.",gideonvwainwright,e926nth,SandersForPresident

>The spoiler effect is the effect of vote splitting between **candidates or ballot questions[n 1] who often have similar ideologies**. One spoiler candidate's presence in the election draws votes from a major candidate with similar politics thereby causing a strong opponent of both or several to win.[1][2][3][4] The minor candidate causing this effect is referred to as a spoiler.[n 2] However, short of any electoral fraud, this presents no grounds for a legal challenge

All you're really doing sobbing spoiler effect is establishing that this brand you are so loyal too is *so* weak, tone deaf, entitled or corrupt that they can lose votes to so much more than just republicans. 

If anything, Democrats are the spoiler effect of evolving past the two party system, promising a place for the GOP while moving further to the right themselves. You're arguing for 80s republican policies at the *best* of candidates, at the *worst* you're apologizing for the Henry Kissingers of our country and you're doing it by saying that Dems don't have to campaign, compete or earn our votes. In that regard *you're* the one helping the GOP and their policies as so much of the US in this digital age has been made aware of the duplicitous liars in the Clintons, the Schumers, Pelosis and even Obamas. Of course the Republicans lie to their constituents too, unfortunately for you, people on the left are largely better educated than those on the right. The left also doesn't benefit from a voter base of fundamentally religious people that the Republicans can depend on. Democrats provenly try to appeal to Republican voters over returning to their roots and trying to bring in progressives and as has been proven, voters on the right will go full ""good christian republican"" everytime. To hope to compete with the right you demand real progressives behave as ignorant, lowering the bar so much that ass hats like Trump and his entire cabinet are possible. If your lauded party actually campaigned on something instead of campaigning on what they're not we wouldn't be having this discussion. But instead you now have to ignore the millions of voters affected by NAFTA, for profit, burgeoning prison systems, for profit, unaffordable healthcare, poor wages, crumbling infrastructure at the misuse of our tax dollars used to stage coups (like Honduras) or assassinate foreign dignitaries causing open slave markets (like Libya) or thereby contribite to the rise of groups such as Daesh (like Iraq) or commit genocide (like Yemen).

>Now the Department of Health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX, the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination in education programs that receive government financial assistance... 

>The department argued in its memo that key government agencies needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined “on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable.” The agency’s proposed definition would define sex as either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals that a person is born with...  

>The new definition would essentially eradicate federal recognition of the estimated 1.4 million Americans who have opted to recognize themselves — surgically or otherwise — as a gender other than the one they were born into.

>“This takes a position that what the medical community understands about their patients — what people understand about themselves — is irrelevant because the government disagrees,” said Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights in the Obama administration and helped write transgender guidance that is being undone.

>The move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers, large and small, to exclude the population from civil rights protections and roll back the Obama administration’s more fluid recognition of gender identity. The Trump administration has sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military and has legally challenged civil rights protections for the group embedded in the nation’s health care law.

>Several agencies have withdrawn Obama-era policies that recognized gender identity in schools, prisons and homeless shelters. The administration even tried to remove questions about gender identity from a 2020 census survey and a national survey of elderly citizens.

>For the last year, the Department of Health and Human Services has privately argued that the term “sex” was never meant to include gender identity or even homosexuality, and that the lack of clarity allowed the Obama administration to wrongfully extend civil rights protections to people who should not have them.

It's not Obama's fault that he was all talk and no walk, it's the voters fault for voting him in and then voting in a Republican Congress. This shit seems to happen every fucking Presidency. Because people are far to impatient about how long it takes for better and bigger change.

So we vote for a Democrat President, after 2 years not a ton has changed, so we vote in a Republican Congress. After 2 years of that usually the incumbent President wins by default, but everyone somehow still votes Republican elsewhere. Then we vote in a Republican President, after 2 years nothing has changed, so we vote in a Democratic Congress. Etc. etc. 

Politics is fucking impossible because of the party line. Republicans all vote together, Democrats all vote together and there's never a large enough majority to truly change anything. 

It's what's broken in our political spectrum and it's why conservatives still think trickle down economics work. Because they've never seen liberal financial beliefs have a real chance more than a few years. And they forget all too quickly how fast the economy usually collapses under Presidents like Reagan and Bush 2.0. ",Uther-Lightbringer,e8zbls8,SandersForPresident

Less War was one of his policies. And helped Saudi Arabia with its war on Yemen. And Trump is continuing it. Supporting and ordering Drone Strikes without any due process. No court. No jury.

Said if I remember correctly we must not just plan for Wall Street but help main street. Did he support Occupy Wallstreet? He supported Wall Street when he said they are too big to fail. And basically rewarded them for almost causing an economic crash. Corporate record profits during Obama. 

It is a fair comparison because Beto is saying good things. But it is nothing new we have not heard before by Democrats. We know they will even talk down on their own party. like Trump did.

"I think Beto is pretty fantastic. As progressive as he is now, he can always become more progressive as the nation becomes moreso too.

His official final on record stance on Medicare For All is that it's the best idea he's seen for how to accomplish every citizen of our nation having healthcare. He's open to other ideas but he hasn't heard anything better.

As you stated, he is clearly better than any Republican and especially Cruz, since they believe Medicare For All would usher in communism. So why people who are supposed to be on Bernie's team here on the left will attack Beto for not being more progressive makes no sense to me. Follow Bernie's footsteps, don't endorse him if it's not enough for you, but don't go negative about the guy.

His response to a constituent about the difficult realities behind why black Americans are protesting and that he can think of nothing more American than protesting as the kneeling players have done was one of the best responses on this issue.

We're here right now commenting on a post which details Beto's criticizing of the Democratic Party. How many other candidates are you heading this from other than Bernie?

He's a damn good candidate who will help push much of the progressive agenda, from climate change to criminal justice reform to healthcare as a right and more. If you don't think he's that good, that's your right. But coming after him or Gillum for not being strongly enough in support of Medicare For All yet strikes me more like the negativity that would be coming from trolls or paid operatives. Didn't downvote you, but it is actually your stance that I find a disservice to the left by putting an impediment to our progress of getting as many progressive-as-possible candidates into office with each election. Obviously we want to go even more progressive in 2020, and more progressive again in 2022, but Beto as one recipient of ""not left enough"" complaints is a terrific candidate in 2018 and should get your support because it's not gonna be fucking easy to take out Ted Cruz in Texas.",RanLearns,e90b7b0,SandersForPresident

Why is it that when we criticize Republicans, Democrats or the biggest one the U. S.?

We our thought to say to others who criticize you are discouraging Republicans or Democrates. And when we call out truths about the Country they are Anti-American.

That is a Totalitarian Notion. The Soviet era they called the dissidents Anti Soviets. Dictatorships They are Anti (insert the country) Nationalism and fascism tactics

The United States if you criticize corporate power or concentrated power you are against the people.  What the fuck does State power and the few elites have to do with most of the people. They shield themselves by making it mean all. 

In a free society that notion should be ridiculous.

Is it discouraging to Democrats that you would want them to live to the ideals they so say they uphold? Is it Discouraging to Republicans to want for them to do what Jesus would do.

We were talking about this sort of thing in my sociology class, and these demographics have a very small sense of societal obligation outside of their own communities. Typically they aren't very likely to go outside their own communities to help society as a whole. Add to that a cultural tendency to view higher education as unnecessary, and you've got a recipe for indifference to politics.

Honestly, those groups have become very compartmentalized, mainly because over the years between the war on immigration and the war on drugs & gangs has made both communities very self-reliant and xenophobic to outsiders and outsider's issues.

A lot of it goes without any competition either, many positions are met with very few votes, and sometimes none at all.

A huge part of is is total disenfranchisement of this generation. We were taught that our vote had no weight, that we had no power, so we believed it. 
I certainly did. 

Then i realized how much voting actually matters, and how many positions of office are actually voted for. Ballots aren't just for one person.

TL;DR:

* Staffers who rely more heavily on conservative and business interest groups for policy information have more skewed perceptions of constituent opinion.  

* Elected officials are more responsive to interest groups and wealthier individuals than to average citizens state politicians from both parties systematically overestimate the conservatism of their constituents.  

* Senior legislative staff have very skewed perceptions of public attitudes... egocentric bias and interest group contact, especially with conservative groups and businesses, may drive some of the mismatch between staffer perceptions and actual public opinion.  

* Staffers whose personal opinions deviated from their constituents’ opinions were less accurate in their estimates of district and state preferences.  

* Staffers who reported greater contact with corporate and ideologically conservative interest groups over liberal and mass-based citizen groups were less likely to get their constituents’ preferences right.  

* 45% of senior legislative staffers report having changed their opinion about legislation after a group gave their Member a campaign contribution.  

* Staffers are more likely to interpret correspondence from businesses as being more representative of their constituents’ preferences than correspondence from ordinary constituents.  

* 80% of senior legislative aides reported that constituent opinion was “extremely” or “very” important in their recommendations to their bosses, most had only a limited ability to characterize what their constituents actually preferred.  

* The prospect of more competitive elections does not appear to spur greater congruence between senior staffers and their constituents.  

* Congress may seem so unresponsive to ordinary citizens is that interest group lobbying and campaign contributions skew staffers’ perceptions of their constituents.  

* Staff may substitute interest groups’ and donors’ positions for constituent preferences.

"I'm predicting a blue wave, gaining 50 house seats and the senate including 10 justice democrats. My reasoning is that the democrats have an insane money advantage in competitive races, double sometimes triple what the republican has and Trump is incredibly unpopular, presidents often lose the house by a lot in midterms. Also polling shows a 8-9 point lead by the democrats but I believe it will be closer to 10-12 points because those polls are of likely voters but this year is seeing insane early and young voter turn out indicating a surge of unlikely voters who wouldn't be factored into polling. As for the Justice democrats I just checked the polling on each race and its rating according to 538, there are 7 solid JDs, 1 toss up JD and 6 underdog JDs with there race rated as likely R, the rest are massive long shots, so I'm predicting 10 win overall. Finally regarding Bernie 2020, I believe he will officially announce either soon after the midterms in time with his book release or early 2019, I imagine it will definitely be earlier than he announced last time because its a completely different race with 30 possible contenders so getting in early is important. ",TomBurcher,e908jc8,SandersForPresident
" 

House. I think we will definitely get a majority. Maybe 30-35 seats? I'm surprisingly optimistic.

Senate. No way we get a majority. Even if Rosen, Beto, and Bredsen miraculously win. I feel like Heidkamp loses, and one of Macaskill/Donnely loses.

Justice Democrats: Right now we have 7 on lock (Tlaib, AOC, Pressley, Oman, Grijalva). We can at worst get 7 wins...and probably at best maybe hit 15-16 wins.

The ones that have a chance right now are Ammar-Campa Najjar (down by 3 in the polls), Kara Eastman, Matt Morgan, Jess King (Only down by 4 right now in a +27 trump district), James Thompson, Rob Davidson (down by 6 in the last poll, in another +18 red district), Audrey Denney (who outraised her opponent in a +23 red district), and Randy Bryce. (Sarah Smith is a wild card right now). I feel like everyone else not mentioned is essentially toast. (The two governors might have a small chance though?)

PCCC/Our Revolution candidates that will definitely make it through: (I'm not sure how legit these candidates are, but they seem okay looking at their websites)  
Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia  
Veronica Escobar  
Mike Levin

The other thing people don't realize is that there are a ton of sleepers in deep red districts (like a lot of the JD candidates listed). However, there are a ton of our revolution/PCC/PR candidates that are doing a ridiculously good job. Richard Ojeda, JD Scholten (the one against the racist Steve King), Liz Watson, Leslie Cockburn are holding their own in deep red districts. Jess King and Audrey Denney are doing way better than expected. Denney for example, got the local newspaper to endorse her (the Chico news has never endorsed a democrat for like 30+ years). I am hoping that several of them outright win. Otherwise the establishment is going to vulture in for 2020 (kind of like what happened to Doug Applegate).

The other reason why I'm a bit optimistic.

>Our proposal would not cut benefits for seniors on Medicare, as the president and his Republican allies claim. In fact, we expand benefits to include dental care, vision care and hearing aids. In addition, Medicare for All would eliminate deductibles and copays for seniors, and significantly lower the cost of prescription drugs. And Medicare for All allows all Americans to see the doctors they want, not the doctors their insurance companies have a contract with.

">The Supreme Court on Friday night refused to halt a novel lawsuit filed by young Americans that attempts to force the federal government to take action on climate change, turning down a request from the Trump administration to stop it before trial.

>The suit, filed in 2015 by 21 young people who argue that the failure of government leaders to combat climate change violates their constitutional right to a clean environment, is before a federal judge in Oregon. It had been delayed while the Supreme Court considered the emergency request from the government.

>Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch would have stopped the suit. The other justices did not indicate how they voted on the government’s request.

>The court’s three-page order said the government should seek relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. It noted the government’s assertion that the “suit is based on an assortment of unprecedented legal theories, such as a substantive due process right to certain climate conditions, and an equal protection right to live in the same climate as enjoyed by prior generations.”

>The justices acknowledged that the 9th Circuit had previously turned down the government but said those decisions came when there was a “likelihood that plaintiffs’ claims would narrow as the case progressed.” That no longer seems the case, the unsigned opinion said, suggesting the possibility that the 9th Circuit might see things differently now.

>And it left open the possibility that the government could return to the Supreme Court.
Close

>The goal of the lawsuit is to compel the government to scale back its support for fossil fuel extraction and production and to support policies aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.

>“We’ve been confident throughout this case that we would get to trial, and I believe we will get to trial,” Julia Olson, the attorney for the youths and executive director of Our Children’s Trust, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Friday evening. “We have overcome everything the government has thrown at us. It is not luck. It is the strength of the case and the strength of the evidence and the strength of the legal arguments we are making.”

>The Obama and Trump administrations had repeatedly asked lower courts to dismiss the lawsuit, questioning its merits, saying discovery requests were “burdensome” and arguing that the suit would usurp the authorities of Congress and federal agencies.

>The plaintiffs “seek nothing less than a complete transformation of the American energy system — including the abandonment of fossil fuels — ordered by a single district court at the behest of ‘twenty-one children and youth,’ ” Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court.

>“As the government has maintained since first moving to dismiss this suit in 2016, [the] assertion of sweeping new fundamental rights to certain climate conditions has no basis in the nation’s history and tradition — and no place in federal court.”

>Francisco acknowledged that he was asking for “extraordinary relief” by asking the high court to intervene before a trial began. But he said the unique nature of the lawsuit deserved such an exception.

>If the long trial were allowed to proceed, “it could well be years into the future” before the government could “seek relief from such an egregious abuse of the civil litigation process and violation of the separation of powers.”

>The government has made similar arguments in lower courts, but time and again, judges allowed the case to proceed. The government also went to the Supreme Court this summer seeking a stay, but the court in an unsigned opinion called the request “premature.”

>In a 103-page filing this week intended to keep the trial on track, the plaintiffs argued that the Trump administration would not suffer “irreparable” harm in having to go through with the case.

>“This case clearly poses profoundly important constitutional questions, including questions about individual liberty and standing, the answers to which depend upon the full evaluation of evidence at trial,” the lawyers wrote, adding: “These young plaintiffs, mere children and youth, are already suffering irreparable harm which worsens as each day passes with more carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere and oceans.”

>The young activists also used the chance to once again demand that the courts compel the government to “cease their violation of plaintiffs’ rights, prepare an accounting of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, and prepare and implement an enforceable national remedial plan to cease the constitutional violations by phasing out fossil fuel emissions and drawing down atmospheric CO2.”

>Olson said the youth plaintiffs were filing a request with the district court in Oregon for a hearing soon in hopes of moving toward the long-awaited trial.

Let me thank all of you for joining us today and asking very great questions. My plea is please get out and vote and bring your friends your family members and co-workers to the polls. We are now living under the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. We have got to end one-party rule in Washington and elect progressive governors and state officials. Let’s revitalize democracy. Let’s have a very large voter turnout on Tuesday. Let’s stand up and fight back. Thank you all very much. Please make a plan to vote here: [https://iwillvote.com/](https://iwillvote.com/)

In my view, the younger generation is the most progressive generation in the history of our country. They are leaders in the fight against sexism, racism, homophobia, religious bigotry, and discrimination. They also understand, even though Trump does not, that climate change is very real and has to be addressed. This younger generation, will have a lower standard of living than their parents if we don’t turn the economy around and create jobs that pay decent wages. I have talked to too many college graduates who are earning 10 or 11 bucks an hour - and that is not acceptable. Further, millions of young people have left school deeply in debt and are struggling hard to pay off those debts. Low wage jobs and high debt makes for a difficult existence. My hope is, that young people in response to these issues will become increasingly involved in the political process and stand up for their rights. The young people can turn this country around if they run for office, if they vote and if they get involved. I very much hope they will.  

---  


What makes me hopeful in these very difficult times is that I get around the country a lot and meet extraordinarily wonderful people. In the last two weeks, as part of this campaign, I will have visited 12 states in support of Democrats and progressive candidates. I have met with hundreds of people who are working day and night working to improve their communities and these people give me a great sense of hope for the future.  

---  


My favorite book at the moment is a brand new book that I wrote that will be coming out in a couple weeks called “Where We Go From Here” and this book talks about the work that I and other progressives have been doing over the last two years in opposition to Trump’s reactionary agenda and how we go forward in creating a government that works for all, and not just the wealthy few.

I think there is a great deal to learn from many countries around the world especially Scandinavian countries. These countries – Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden – provide healthcare to all people as a right, have excellent universal child care programs and make higher education available to all their young people at no or little cost. Further, they have been aggressive in taking on climate change and moving towards sustainable energy. These countries understand it's important to have a government that works for all of their people, not just the people on top, and that’s a lesson we must learn for our country.

I love Vermont because of its natural beauty. When you visit us, you will find that we are truly one of the most beautiful states in the country and that we have four special seasons. Right now, the leaves are changing which is a beautiful time to visit Vermont. Further, we have a very down to earth type of politics in which candidates at the local, state and federal level remain close to the people. I think it’s fair to say that in Vermont at one level or another I have personally met a good percentage of the people in our state. Lastly, I’m proud that in recent years Vermont has developed one of the most progressive election systems in the country making it very easy for people to vote.

This a very important question and an  issue I’ve been working very hard on for the last year. In fact, a resolution I brought the Senate floor with Senators Lee and Murphy called for ending in the war in Yemen. That war is an unbelievable and horrific humanitarian disaster. That country is facing a cholera epidemic and widespread famine. We should not be allied with a dictatorship like Saudi Arabia who is leading the effort in that war. Further, in my view, that war is unconstitutional because Congress, which has the war-making authority in our form of government, has not authorized it. Let’s get out of Yemen as soon as possible and help bring humanitarian help to that struggling country.

Saudi Arabia is a brutal dictatorship which does not tolerate dissent, which treats women as third class citizens and which is run by a handful of multi-billionaires. I strongly condemn Trump’s affection for the rulers of Saudi Arabia, and if we are to avoid a never ending war in that part of the world, it is imperative that we develop an even-handed policy toward Iran and Saudi Arabia. 

---  

This is a huge issue which I am deeply immersed in. Not only do we have to make colleges and universities tuition-free but we have to provide help to the tens of millions of Americans who are struggling with outrageous levels of student debt. Right now, there are millions of Americans who have $50,000 or $100,000 of debt and struggle to pay that debt often at high interest rates. If Trump and his Republican colleagues can provide a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1% we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free and substantially lower the burden of student debt on millions of Americans. 

---  


I think we need to make a lot of improvements we have got to appreciate the young people of this country are the future of America. That means ending the absurdity that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. Children cannot learn if they’re hungry or homeless or if their families are struggling with drug addiction. Further, we have got to respect educators in this country and make sure that we attract the best and brightest to the teaching profession by paying our teachers good wages and providing them with good working conditions. Unbelievably, in America today, there are states like Oklahoma and Colorado where kids are going to school 4 days a week because of budgetary constraints. How insane is that? Further, we need to move toward universal, affordable childhood pre-K. The bottom line is: instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations we need to fund our schools and respect educators.

---

When I was a young man, I did smoke marijuana on several occasions. For me, the result was a lot of coughing. Having said that, I strongly believe that we should move toward the legalization of marijuana because that issue is an integral part of our failed criminal justice system. Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country, and there are millions of Americans who have police records because they were arrested for possessing marijuana. And when that happens, it can be harder to get a job or an apartment. If we are serious about criminal justice reform in this country, we must move towards the legalization of marijuana and that is something I’ll fight for.

---

I would hope that there would be widespread support in Congress, as I know there is among the American people for the legislation that I’ve introduced, which would guarantee healthcare to all Americans through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program. The first year of the 4-year phase-in program calls for lowering the eligibility age from 65 to 55 and for covering all the children in America. I would hope we can get widespread bipartisan support for that. Further, all Americans, whether they’re conservative or progressive understand we’re being ripped off by the pharmaceutical industry, which charge us by far the most per country. The American people want us to stand up to the drug industry and I hope very much we gain bipartisan support to do that.

It is incomprehensible to me that we have a president who is not only a racist, sexist, homophobe, xenophobe and religious bigot - but a president who rejects science. The debate over climate change is over. The scientific community is almost 100% united in telling us that climate change is real, caused by human activity, and is already doing devastating harm to our country and the world. We must as a nation lead the world in moving aggressively toward such sustainable energy as wind, solar and geothermal and when we do that, we will not only combat climate change but create millions of good paying jobs and lower electric bills. We must also move toward the electrification of our transportation system and rebuild our crumbling rail system. The United States should lead the world in combating climate change not have a president who rejects science and works with the fossil fuel industry.

---

This is the most important midterm election in the modern history of this country and it is enormously important than young people come out and vote. In fact, in my view, if young people vote at the same percentage as older people do we can transform this country and move aggressively towards, economic justice, social justice, racial justice, and environmental justice. Do not sit out this election. It it too important. Please vote and bring your friends and co-workers to the polls.

---  

If Democrats take control the House or the Senate we must move to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. We must immediately lower prescription drug costs in this country and we must work aggressively towards Medicare for All. We also have to take on Trump in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy as we combat the great threat of climate change.",Chartis,e8xh6ad,SandersForPresident

**Unrelated:** I don't think tracking cash flow would directly help with untangling how or why regulatory capture occurs: many positions are appointments, so transparency for who funds a campaign isn't straightforward. Best you can do in that situation is try to figure out which people are in charge of an organization and then attempt to research any sort of revolving door where they exit the industry and then go to work as a regulator & vice versa.

I don't think is the real ""ask me anything"" thread, but if bernie or someone affiliated with the campaign or movement or a moderator sees this:

This seems like typical work place propaganda, see Wall-Mart

While some unions can be relatively bad, there generally is some form of democracy and power to reform the leadership. This is rarely true in the work place. So a basic question would be, who is more likely to be on ""your"" side ? Fellow workers or the bosses or owners of a company. 

> The union is not on their side. The average workers' ""high"" rate of pay is due to the company, not the union.

How would that even work ? Companies always want to pay less in salary to workers. Only necessity will force them to raise wages, or maybe a very generous boss. But that seems extremely rare. Unions just form a way to negotiate collectively (were this is allowed or facilitated). 

> that rate of pay is decided by the union.

How is that even possible ? A company can just pay more money to its workers if it wanted to. 

> Is there any initiative to clean up corrupt unions?

I am not sure if you are kidding or not, but police can look into union books and they are under extreme scrutiny. Unions are literally under almost constant attack. Not just ""corrupt"" ones, all fucking unions in the country. 

No offense, and best not to say this to your husband, but he seems completely tricked and fooled by anti-union propaganda.

Higher minimum wages do not work.  
Bernie should know this since he likes to speak so highly of Scandinavian countries. Most do not have minimum wages.    
Switzerland turned down a $25/hr minimum wage because they knew it would hurt the economy. 

There is a deeper issue here and that is ""inflation"". The US desperately needs to get it under control. Once we do that, the minimum wage will not be an issue.

"Wow. I wanted a real answer not an attack. Do you really think that my incredibly selfish husband is the only one with similar concerns? Does it make sense to push people away by attacking them, or to educate them and draw them closer to your side? 

I wanted to know a really *good* explanation to give to my husband. My husband who will be voting a straight democrat ticket and will vote for Bernie if he runs. It doesn't really seem like a good idea to tell him that he is a selfish bastard for wondering what a minimum wage increase will do to struggling middle class families. I'd much rather have a really good explanation. Something based of data. I guess I should have tried some other subreddit. 


And my husband isn't anti-union or falling for propaganda. He's observing what is going on at the factory where he works. This is the real world, not all unions are perfect. I'm not saying that the union is doing anything criminal. But from what my husband sees they are taking 25 cents an hour from employees and the employees aren't getting anything from it.

"> Wow. I wanted a real answer not an attack.

It is a real answer. Because I heard those arguments a million times before. It's literally anti-union propaganda. Are all unions good ? No, they are not. But that was not what you were writing. 

And the other stuff too, it's just based on nothing. Look at the studies on the effect of the minimum wage. This is about employment levels (""ahh if we raise wages, people will lose jobs"")

https://www.epi.org/publication/the-impact-of-raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-12-by-2020-on-workers-businesses-and-the-economy-testimony-before-the-u-s-house-committee-on-education-and-the-workforce-member-forum/

> Most importantly, research has consistently shown that raising the minimum wage boosts the pay of low-wage workers who typically come from low- and moderate-income households. Because these households typically spend a larger portion of their income than wealthier households, the rising wage floor can provide a modest boost to consumer spending, generating new business activity, particularly in lower-income areas where consumer demand is more depressed. And this is true even if some firms have to enact small price increases as a result of the higher minimum wage. Pay raises for low-wage workers resulting from higher minimum wages are vastly larger than any resulting price increases – typically by a factor of more than 10 to 1.7 This is because labor costs are only one piece of businesses’ overall operating costs, and as previously noted, raising pay simultaneously generates savings from higher productivity and lower turnover.

And let me quote you

>  He feels like he has worked really hard to get to the salary level that he is currently at. He feels that if minimum wage is raised, he would then effectively be making less

Which is simply implying that your husband cares more about his relative earnings than about poor people. 

> he is a selfish bastard for wondering what a minimum wage increase will do to struggling middle class families.

If you are struggling, how do you expect poor people on 7.25 to do ? 

Inflation (this is specific to some places in Cali), but i guess it's at least somewhat similar for other places

> Businesses could absorb the remaining payroll cost increases by increasing prices by 0.6 percent through 2023. This price increase is well below the annual inflation rate of 1.8 percent over the past five years. Price increases in restaurants would be 5.1 percent.

> This is the real world, not all unions are perfect.

At least they are democratic, so if they are not doing a good job your husband or other people can influence it directly. Unlike those who own the company.

> But from what my husband sees they are taking 25 cents an hour from employees and the employees aren't getting anything from it.

Maybe he union is powerless and can't do much, maybe your husband is wrong. I don't know. But I am 99.99% sure that unions are far more often on the side of workers than the company is. 

> Our daughter is one of those employees.

>2. Raise the minimum wage to a living wage: 15 bucks an hour. And I will do everything that I can to make sure that in the first 100 days of a Democratic Congress, we pass a $15 an hour minimum wage.

"Shaun King is a fellow at the Sanders Institute. Shaun King and Ben Dixon have announced they are launching a progressive media organization called The North Star:

> In 1847, with slavery still in full force, two brave men, Frederick Douglass and Martin Delany (both pictured above), started an abolitionist newspaper called The North Star — named for the star, Polaris, that was often used as a guide for those seeking freedom in the North. While The North Star was originally a print newspaper, we will be launching a news app, a full news website, a collection of podcasts, and an online nightly news broadcast. We’re not just here to change the news — we aim to change the world.

Also, there is nothing even a highly articulate and hateful person could do with words that would offend me more than behaving as if they had the faculties and justification to fill me with false belief.  Prevaricators and hatemongers are villainous to the extent their words put bodies in the ground.

"Holy Fuck did you miss the point. What Hillary and her supporters did were the reason Trump is in office. Not a few critical Bernie supporters.

She went out of her way to get Donald Trump to run and to be the Republican front runner.

Meanwhile, I am a regular everyday person, who volunteer for Bernie and tried to fix a corrupt and broken Caucus. This showed me how little power I really have. I had some impact on the caucus but zero impact on the general.

So who is more to blame for Trump being in office? Me a single voter or Hillary Clinton, leader of one of the most powerful political dynasties in decades? 

Stop blaming voters and realize Hillary Clinton did this to herself and had more impact on the 2016 election, than any single voter.

In my opinion, a job making minimum wage is just a temporary occupation while you attend school, gain experience, or find something more in line with your interest.
The other thing to keep in mind is that it could go the other way. Take for instance McDonald's. They will probably more likely automate the process so in essence your gonna be cutting 10 jobs into 3.

They also observe that small minimum wage increases do not lead to higher prices and may actually reduce prices. Furthermore, it is also possible that small minimum wage increases could lead to increased employment in low-wage labor markets.

Not only do ordinary citizens not have uniquely substantial power over policy decisions; they have little or no independent influence on policy at all.. economic elites stand out as quite influential more so than any other set of actors studied here.. both individual economic elites and organized interest groups (including corporations, largely owned and controlled by wealthy elites) play a substantial part in affecting public policy, but the general public has little or no independent influence.

Define effective. Did those countries see an overall drop in violent crime as compared to the same time period as the US? Were suicide rates reduced? If not it wasn't effective in anything or than shifting the method. A reduction in gun crime is meaningless. Of course less guns means less gun crimes. Just like if you banned trucks you'd see a reduction in truck related DWIs but if total DWIs doesn't fall who cares. As far as the dickey amendment it was literally passed because the CDC had an anti-gun agenda and funded studies specifically to support its agenda. Did the NRA lobby for it? Yes but that does not mean the CDC was not acting shady. Just because a group you don't like passed a law you don't like doesn't mean it's bad.

"I don't concede to anything. Again I can't continue to pick apart your arguments such as South Korea has fairly strict guns laws yet is top 5 in the world in suicides.

Only honest citizens follow the law and there are millions of guns with no paper trail to their current owners. Lots of stuff looks good on paper, works in smaller areas/communities,  etc. That just won't work with a country our scale and size. So in closing no I don't concede any of my points. I just don't wish to waste anymore of my time with this. Changing your mind does absolutely nothing.",enameless,e8xss4h,SandersForPresident

tourism, water quality, fishing industry destroyed.

big sugar run off has helped create this

Yes you are right about pay day loans.... there used to be usury laws

Here is what Tim Canova has to say on the issue

""Though economists tell us that the 2008 Great Recession ended years ago, many Americans have been left behind by the economic recovery. In this time of so much economic uncertainty, millions of hardworking American families are living paycheck to paycheck and are increasingly relying on payday loans to keep up with their bills and make ends meet.

Payday loans are short-term loans, generally less than $500 in value that come due when the borrower collects their next paycheck. While the amounts being borrowed are relatively low, the interest rates on these loans are shockingly high. Most credit cards companies charge between 15 and 30 percent annual interest, but payday lenders typically charge more than 300 percent annual interest for their loans. Worse yet, due to the high cost of borrowing and the very short repayment period for payday loans, the consumers that rely on them often become trapped in what President Obama called “a vicious cycle of debt.”

Despite their predatory lending tactics, the universal outcry of consumer protection groups and the condemnation of leaders such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and President Obama, my opponent Debbie Wasserman Schultz has accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from payday lenders. If this were not enough, my opponent has also joined Republicans in co-sponsoring a bill that would delay the regulation of payday lenders for years and continue to burden millions of working families with endless debt. This is why the editorial board of the Sun Sentinel has called on Wasserman Schultz to “not swim with loan sharks.”

Debbie Wasserman Schultz has also voted to prevent President Obama’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from issuing regulations against “racial redlining” in the auto loan market. There should be no place in our society for these kinds of predatory financial practices, including those that discriminate against people on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender or other personal characteristics.

When I am elected to Congress I promise to regulate the payday lending industry. I will work hard to limit the loan shark style practices of the payday lending industry and the debt traps they work so hard to create. I also promise to propose alternatives – like postal banking – to give working families access to the type of small loans they may need in an emergency, but at much lower interest rates. By working together, we can put a stop to this greedy industry that exploits hard working families and find new solutions for the people of Florida""( Tim Canova, 2018).

Lots of good examples. Just look at HRC pivot to the left during the primary. Reject TPP, accept min wage increase, accept free college and expanding health care... among other things.

If voters engaged instead of just abstaining you’d see more change from within. Instead parties just wait for moderates to get tired of the other side and take power.

I disagree with this. The difference is republicans will rally around their guy whoever they are.

The difference is they vote so republicans always pander to their base. The racists, the moderate republicans the tea party guys the evangelicals. The never Hillary movement was MUCH more effective than the never trump movement.

Back to my point about liberals being as dumb as republicans. HRC rejected TPP in the primaries and as far as shooting war with the Russians, you have zero evidence for that.

He announced this week that he would make additional trips to Maryland, Florida and New Hampshire before Election Day.

I have had numerous jobs in sales, including health insurance and if I said ""buy some fucking health insurance you loser dipshit moron because if you get sick you're screwed"" They'd have kicked me the fuck out of their room and rightfully so.

For myself I call myself a populist because I lean more right on some of these social issues. I'm pro life, support optional prayer in schools, and the right to own guns. I vote for Bernie and populist left wingers, including Abdul El-Sayed in my state, because I think getting money out of politics is the most important issue and providing healthcare for all and a green new deal is a close second.

I can't vote for McCaskill but I wanted to read this. If I were in Missouri I would've walked away thinking ""I'm voting for Josh Harley.""

Maybe I don't fit the mold of the ""liberal dipshit"" this article is aiming at but in all my years as a former republican, I never encountered this kind of ""insult your way to the top"" mentality that democrats have embraced.

It boils down to two things: first, this nation welcomed all of *our* ancestors, and I don't reckon the standards should be any different just because my ancestors came here first. Second, the whole thing seems to come back to illegal immigration. This problem is artificial. Open immigration, and suddenly everyone is documented and everyone has the protection of law, and nobody is losing their job to people who will work for less because nobody *can* work for less.

Consider for example the welfare and social safety nets we provide today. These things are very expensive, and already overburdened. Migrants tend to be poor, and looking for a better future away from home. They would make use of our social safety nets, which are already strained to the breaking point in some cases.

"Legal what?

Legal Immigrants? Have you gone through Immigration? Do you know what it takes to ""legally"" enter the US? Thousands of dollars, sponsors, background checks, police reports, 100+ pages of evidence, months of waiting. The vast majority of people trying to get into the US don't have access to those resources or the money to afford the costs. I know, my wife is a Green Card holder.

It's also a major misconception for a huge section of the US that people ""legally"" immigrated and I specifically mean White folks. So far as I know immigration law didn't exist for the first 100 years of the US' existence. Up until the late 1800's there was no ""illegal"" immigration. You showed up, then through the paces, and could become a citizen. Not until the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 did we place restrictions on immigration and its important to acknowledge that because the establishment of immigration policy was fueled by nativism and racism then just the same as now.

Not to mention that the same folks that rail against ""illegals"" and even the fence sitters fail to understand  the establishment of immigration laws was a racist means by which to keep ""others"" aka the Chinese (because they are non-whites) from being able to leverage any of the social institutions available to our citizens. Capitalists turned US workers against immigrants all the while taking advantage of the immigrants cheap labor. Immigrants became the scapegoat for poor working conditions and wages rather than acknowledging that it was in fact the Capitalist bosses that were responsible and were simply blaming immigrants because it sowed division in the work force and would prevent folks from banding together to take on their bosses.

Immigration Law in the US was established as a tool for White Supremacy so listening to people cry about ""illegal"" immigration is disingenuous and ignorant of our history, or maybe they are just truly hateful people that like to blame others for their own ability to rise to the occasion. My money is on the later of the two.

IMO those that rail against immigrants and tout immigration law as some tool for good also tend to be the same people that cant accept responsibility for the way their lives have gone. More often than not I find it to be White Men in particular that are extremely hostile toward immigrants, which is interesting seeing as how being a White Man in the US is basically playing life on easy mode. So what happens when the super entitled person doesnt get everything they think they deserve or are ""owed""...they blame immigrants, they blame poor people, they blame black and brown folks.

As to your last paragraph, why does your view of the countries of origin for many illegal immigrants (or those overstaying visas, whatever the case) have to be so god damn condescending? How many of these illegal immigrants do you ACTUALLY think are escaping imminent death, or a war zone, or cartels? There are refugee processes for them, no? It's not quite ""immigration"" in that case.

Many illegal immigrants in the US cross the US-Canada border to avoid deportation (again, because of visas) while being completely ignorant of Canadian immigration laws, that are barely being enforced.

"> Immigration Law in the US was established as a tool for White Supremacy

Not a straw-man, but good to know you are aware of logical fallacies.

> How about you try and prove that?  

I don't need to ""prove it"" it is in our history. How can you in good conscious look at Immigration Law (which started with & continued to use race as a means of determining admittance) isn't steeped and established in racism. The definition of White was such a shitty and false notion that the SCOTUS was forced to acknowledge that a dark skinned I think Indian man is in fact White under the definition provided because his ancestry came from the Caucasus Mountains however they rejected his claim because they were using the ""common sense"" definition. See [US Vs Bhagat Singh Thind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Bhagat_Singh_Thind).


The creation of a legal definition of ""White"" came to be about the same time as immigration laws came into being. There was also a massive nativist population exerting political pressure on the US Congress to restrict immigration based on race which came to fruition cause like I said, see US vs Bhagat Singh Thind. There's several other cases, a few of them older than US vs Bhagat Singh Thind but his case is the 1st that comes to mind.

I can understand that the vast majority of US citizens don't receive a well rounded education when it comes to our history. Too much exceptionalism and glossing over of some of the most vile things our nation has ever done because well it looks bad. Sadly that means folks end up mis-educated and unaware of how much they don't know.

Here's a UC Berkeley Study examining racism in past and current immigration law published in [2016.] (https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&context=blrlj)

[Ozawa vs the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozawa_v._United_States) is another example of racism in immigration.

Anecdotes aren't dismissed outright, they are just a weaker form of evidence. That anecdote is also the summation of 30+ years living as a Straight, White, Man in the US and seeing as how I am committing on Straight, White, Men, being one myself...well maybe men in this nation ought to do some reflection because our demographic has been and still is the most dangerous and destructive in the US. Violent Crime, Rape, Race Crimes, etc by and large are committed by straight, white, men. There's a reason that so many women say ""men are trash"" because our culture has major issues with toxicity, violence, and racism.

The root cause of these issues is that Immigration Law was established as a racist means of controlling who came to the nation and that it continues to do so. The root cause is the collective shedding of our native cultures for some made up bullshit called ""White"", something so poorly thought out and unscientific that PoC challenged it and eventually the laws had to change. The fact that there have been powerful and strong anti-immigration waves aimed at specific peoples is more evidence that it is about race and power and not about protecting the nation or doing what is best.

From anti-miscegenation laws prohibiting the marrying of different races, to the creation of the White Imaginary, to the formation of groups like the Asiatic Exclusion League, all the way on up to modern anti-Latino attitudes this has always been about race and power, to suggest otherwise is dishonest.

Even *IF* the racist results of these decisions were not intended, they still remain racist. Intent seldom matters.

> How many of these illegal immigrants do you ACTUALLY think are escaping imminent death, or a war zone, or cartels?

Tens of thousands. We admit about 20,000 of them. I also know there are at least 5000 of them headed here now, displaced due to the rape of Latin American nations by the US and other capitalists.

>  There are refugee processes for them, no? It's not quite ""immigration"" in that case. 

Sure, there are however getting refugee status is not simply a matter of saying you are fleeing violence. You have to prove it. Prove who you are, who your family is, where you were born, and why you were forced to leave. So basically you better have all your paperwork ready BEFORE you need the status because you can and many are turned away. You don't just apply and you are in. You must have a referral from the UN called a USRAP. Your fear of returning must be ""well founded"". Until they are processed as a refugee they remain an asylee and as such are not eligible for any government assistance. So if you don't have someone to take you in, your'e in a bad spot. And here's the best part...if a mistake is made, if the application is declined, there is no appeal. You get sent back end of story.

Finally, even if we wanted to ignore the Chinese Exclusion act, the history of laws related to immigration and naturalization going back to the late 18th century...is about race. In order for a person to apply for citizenship they have to live in the country for 2 years, maintain their current residence for a year, and...this is the real meat of it they had to be ""free white persons"" of ""good moral character"" in order to received naturalization rights.

That is to say that the very 1st law passed in the US specifically restricted citizenship by race and it just kept going from there.",ThisPlaceIsToxic,e8t9k8b,SandersForPresident

"It's difficult to address all of your points as well as the UC Berkeley study to which I am taking greatly with a grain of salt -- given the political climate at UC Berkeley. Not only that, but the content of the study makes certain inferences and uses loaded words which display the intent of the authors. 

To suggest that those immigration laws were used as a tool for white supremacy, that's just not the case. The Naturalization Act of 1906 included those of African descent, but was apparently intended to address the inconsistencies at the state level -- states would selectively enforce naturalization laws for their own electoral benefit. 

If I'm not mistaken, the cases you brought up revolved around the naturalization of foreign born citizens, not necessarily their ability to immigrate to the US. Those of African descent were eligible for naturalization, which I assume had something to do with the creation of the term ""African American"". In the 1940 Immigration Act which replaced the 1906 one, a much more diverse group was eligible for naturalization, although certain provisions within the act meant the loss of citizenship for some English residents which leads me to believe there's not necessarily a white supremacy element to those immigration laws. The 1990 act that came after that seemed to level the playing field for naturalization of all citizens. I also don't believe there was much German immigration after the 1940 act was implemented, and the Nazi Party were pretty well white supremacists. 
I honestly cannot address your personal identification of being a ""straight white male"" as I strongly, strongly disagree with your opinions on that issue. But the group most responsible for the crimes you listed.. You're simply not correct on that one. If the US population of white people (excluding latinos) is about 79%, then cumulative crimes may belong to them. Per capita, that's extremely far from being the case. 
Immigration laws were instituted for much more than anything relating to white supremacy -- politics and war were incredibly different in the early 20th century and earlier, even in the 1940s. The AEL was founded very early in the 1900s, and after a challenge of Japanese Americans for the right to attend SF public schools - they ended up winning and earned that right. But this wasn't a government organization anyway. 

Again, I can't address all the points, but to even suggest that we admit thousands illegal immigrants due to ""the rape of Latin American nations by the US and other capitalists"" is almost wholly incorrect. For example, if MS13 is a motivation for Mexicans to immigrate to achieve citizenship or refugee status, I don't see them being a product of American raping other countries or capitalism that's not domestic. 

But the process for admittance of refugees is partly due to the fact that those applying for refugee status actually *require* it instead of other incentives to move to the US. This process definitely isn't 100% perfect, but with me being Canadian and seeing the opposite end of the illegal immigration/refugee claims, examples of refugee claimants from Africa overstaying visas in the US shows how effectively the system can be abused. Almost 90% of those claimants (I could be getting the numbers wrong by a little bit) were predicted to be rejected. 

So to conclude, and again I can't address everything, immigration law is inclusive of updated and modern laws to which factually have nothing to do with white supremacy and were repealed and updated to reflect that. ",Anticitizen-Zero,e8tcrw9,SandersForPresident

"Yeah, I'm out. You are all over the place. I've provided you evidence, you reject it because its contests your own beliefs. You cant address my points because you don't have the knowledge to do so. Your inability to see and comprehend the destruction and theft the US has committed repeatedly in Latino nations just further illustrates how little you know about US involvement in those nations. The fact you can't see how capitalists exploited and still exploit nations in the Americas and huge swaths of Africa (and other ""poor"" nations) just tells me that you haven't looked or don't care because it hasn't negatively affected you.

I've addressed your points. I've provided cited materials. I'm done, this is Reddit and I've already gone above and beyond what most would do. It's not my job to teach you and I certainly don't owe you a thesis or dissertation on the presence and uses of racism in the current and past iterations of US Immigration Law. The racism is right there in the history, refusing to acknowledge that is just an emotional commitment to ignorance.

Canada is a racist society as well. Sure, not quite as extreme as the US but your own government has done (and recently too I might add) some pretty horrible things to non-Whites. Y'all like people to think its a nice little nation but the PoC I know and the history I know shows Canada has major issues with racism and xenophobia as well...why you might ask? Well because the European nations that created and shaped your and my nations...were racist as fuck and built that racism into the very fabric of our nations.

Also, Fact doesn't mean *YOU* think it is correct. A fact is a verifiable statement found to be true. 

Lets do a brain exercise. Racism deals with the exclusion of peoples from civic life (and other things) based on race. And 'White' is legally considered a race (although scientifically race is not real). So if the US created an immigration and citizenship policy, one that said something like ""You have to be White to be a citizen""...that would be an exclusion from civic life based on race, therefore racist. So yes, US Immigration & citizenship laws WERE founded as racist laws. Saying otherwise is untruthful and racist because it downplays the severity of the issue, and by downplaying it it receives less attention, which perpetuates the issues rather than addressing them.

The US' Immigration and Citizenship laws have since their inception been steeped in race. IMO You need to study more history because I ain't buying the BS you are pushing. Adios.

PS. Seriously...MS13 is your example? Could you have picked anything nearer and dearer to Trump's racist depictions of Latinos as your example? And yeah, there is a pretty strong argument to be made about how US interference has hobbled many Latino nations causing economic uncertainty which has been a contributing factor to the proliferation of Cartels and other outbreaks of gang & political violence.",ThisPlaceIsToxic,e8th17f,SandersForPresident

You provided no evidence to back up your claims, I had to explain YOUR sources to you, and yet you still, REALLY REALLY want to believe that immigration laws are a racist tool for white supremacy.

You couldn’t even explain how Latin America has somehow elected terrible governments and spawned cartels because of white people and capitalists.

Libertarians are just color blind racists that fail to understand that Smith, Locke, Etc's economic theories and polices were based off the idea of Whites being the ideal, the civilized, the most advanced. 

Seriously some of the most racist shit thought up about nation states and various economic polices and models came from those worshiped at the alter of Libertarianism. Not to mention that a lot of their ideas were just shit. They werent created in a scientific manner and rationalism as a whole isn't rational. Humans arent ration beings, we are emotion beings and the markets more correctly reflect that than any semblance of rational thought. Or the ""invisible hand"" as some unseen and magical force that just happens. He was right about self-interest tho, that motivates a lot of people.

The biggest difference between Libertarianism and the Alt-Right is that Libertarians are all about individuality whereas the Alt-Right is about collectivism. Other than that the two mirror each other quite well, one is just less obvious in its inherit racism. Whats even worse is that so many Alt-Right folks end up identifying as such because they started off as Libertarians. Libertarianism is for White Men. Seriously, go look at the composition of Libertarians, they are overwhelming White men, more-so than the Republicans.

FFS Rand Paul said he drew issue with the Civil Rights laws of the 1960s. Even if he truly didn't hate PoC he was still advocating for policies which negatively impacted their communities. He was upset that the government was telling businesses they couldnt discriminate because that impedes on a persons right to discriminate.

I also wanted to revisit this. You seem to think or at least based on your statement that the AEL won the right of Japanese and Korea Americans to attend public schools. That isn't what they did. They were trying to force Japanese and Koreans (who werent attending school with their Chinese counterparts) out of public White schools and into a forcefully segregated ""Oriental"" school. So yes, the AEL won, but what they won was racist exclusion of Japanese and Koreans, they didn't secure the right for those groups to attend public school.

The AEL's entire purpose for existing was to push people of Asian ancestry out of the US. They wanted the US to be a White Man's nation. And yes, its obvious they were not a government agency, that said they affected government agencies and pushed for policies of racism and exclusion and so for that they got tossed in with a mix of other forms of supremacy exerted on PoC when I was talking about White Supremacy.",ThisPlaceIsToxic,e8tl1hw,SandersForPresident

That’s not the case, and I can just as easily say he’s okay with black people refusing to serve white people. Or okay with gays not serving evangelicals.

Now, it is my opinion in this case that the consequences for expressing a negative and bigoted belief due to religion are much worse than muzzling bigots because it went public and got a LOT of attention. I neither agree with religion or Jack Phillips' stance on marriage and his refusal to make the cake, but do you not believe that receiving death threats, public vilification, and a court case are pretty dire consequences? 
Now, let's say I agree that the law should compel private businesses not to discriminate. What do you propose people like Rand Paul do to address racism? 
Honestly, these decisions have little to do with trying to oppress others. These things are what allow you to call others who aren't racist, racist. You can choose to create a business, and decide not to offer your services to people like me and Rand Paul. Do you really want those freedoms to be revoked?

>* As a result of his sabotage of the Affordable Care Act, 13 million more Americans will become uninsured over the next decade while millions more have seen their premiums rise  
>* His administration is working alongside 20 Republican state attorneys general to end the protection that the Affordable Care Act now guarantees to people with pre-existing conditions

>* Workers would not have to stay at jobs they dislike just because their employer provides decent health insurance

>* It would eliminate deductibles and copays for seniors and significantly lower the cost of prescription drugs. 
>* It allows seniors and all Americans to see the doctors they want, not the doctors in their insurance networks.  
>* Trump claims that Medicare for All is not affordable. That is nonsense. What we cannot afford is:  

>  * to continue [spending almost twice as much per capita](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFwP1nPVwAEWDVt.jpg) on health care as any other country on Earth. 
>  * the $28,000 it currently costs to provide health insurance for the average family of 4.
>  * to have 30 million Americans with no health insurance & even more who are under-insured with high deductibles and high co-payments. 
>  * to have millions of Americans get sicker than they should, and in some cases die, because they can’t afford to go to the doctor.

"The general season for candidates to declare their candidacy is early 2019. Bernie announced on April 28th, 2015.

Personally, I like Nina Turner or Barbara Lee as progressive firebrands who could take up the mantle of a rare, hard-won progressive administration.

Tulsi Gabbard also makes sense and adds some valuable foreign policy experience. 

Often times, deals are made between candidates to step out of each other's way in the primaries, in exchange for positions in the administration. Such a deal with Elizabeth Warren could potentially occur.",WhiskeyInferno,e8rv9il,SandersForPresident
"I think Bernie should announce early so he can dominate the race from the start. As for the VP I think Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren or Nina Turner are most likely.",TomBurcher,e8s0xbh,SandersForPresident
"I think when he announces will depend on what happens in the midterms.  If the Dems do very well seems to me he should announce soon after the midterms.  If things go badly, like they fail to take back the House somehow,  I think he might take some time to regroup.  You could also argue the opposite, that a disastrous midterm result would leave progressives and liberals desperate for some hope and leadership, and a good result might mean spending some time to build with the incoming progressives in Congress and see how things are shaping up.  All in all, I'd still say sooner is better than later and his hand may be forced by others—I'll bet on not too long after the midterms.  

For VP:  though he's in great shape for his age, Bernie may well be limited by age/health to a single term.  Even if not, he has to be thinking about it as a possibility.  I think he would need to consider someone who can run and win the presidency after him, that will advance his agenda and take a major leadership level for progressives at a global level.  I don't see him picking a VP candidate just to shore up some weaknesses politically.  I'm sure he's conscious of a pent up desire for female leadership, though, so I can hardly see him not picking a woman as VP.  For that reason, I see some other Senate allies like Jeff Merkley and Sherrod Brown as most likely out.

While Elizabeth Warren is more market-oriented in her politics, and not a Democratic Socialist, she is his closest ally and collaborator in the Senate.  She's also a little old to serve as VP plus one or more terms as President, and she's another white New Englander (though with OK roots),  but I think he would trust her to carry forward after him and is his most likely and arguably best pick.   Plus he may need her supporters to get behind him to finish first.

Also, I think Warren's going to run but underwhelm in the early states, consistently falling just below 15% viability, and I see her dropping out after Super Tuesday without a whole lot of delegates (she'll do OK in caucus states, NH, and MA).  I'm guessing it's gonna be Bernie and Biden top 2, with Harris at about 20% to round out the last three standing, and could very likely end with no candidate earning a majority of delegates.  It could come down to some horse-trading for votes on a second ballot, so we'd see how that plays out.   I can't see Bernie picking Kamala Harris (too centrist) unless he's forced to in order to garner votes in a second round situation.

&#x200B;

Some others:

Nina Turner:  Obviously close ally but maybe not enough experience at a national or international level

Rep Tulsi Gabbard:  I don't see it.  Problematic support for Hindu nationalists in India and at least appearing to defend Syria's Assad

Rep Barbara Lee:  Fantastic progressive, potentially problematic backstory with Black Panther Party, less international experience, I think

Rep Pramila Jayapal:  not US born citizen, can't become president, out

Rep Raul Grijalva:  male, old, maybe not in great health so less likely though a strong progressive

Rep Ro Khanna: young, progressive, close ally in Congress.  Maybe, but male, also just a soon-to-be-second term Rep.  

I could also see Bernie picking an indigenous running mate like:

Winona LaDuke:  Indigenous/environmental activist.  Ran for VP in 1996 and 2000 on Green Party ticket with Ralph Nader, actually earned 1 Electoral College vote for VP in 2016 election.    I could just see Bernie making a pick like this.

Paulette Jordan: Idaho state rep and gov candidate.  Would be a ""dark horse"" pick, no national experience yet, but she's charismatic, progressive (I think more than she shows in red-state Idaho), and from rural America

Curious to hear from others...

> One day... there would come a time, when the earth being ravaged and polluted, the forests being destroyed, the birds would fall from the air, the waters would be blackened, the fish being poisoned in the streams, and the trees would no longer be, mankind as we would know it would all but cease to exist   
>  
>**There will come a day when people of all races, colors, and creeds will put aside their differences. They will come together in love, joining hands in unification, to heal the Earth and all Her children.** They will move over the Earth like a great Whirling Rainbow, bringing peace, understanding and healing everywhere they go. Many creatures thought to be extinct or mythical will resurface at this time; the great trees that perished will return almost overnight. All living things will flourish, drawing sustenance from the breast of our Mother, the Earth.  

As an aside, there's an awesome Jungian book I recommend called The Vision Thing. 

Near the beginning of the book, it discussed the age-old tension between ""the one"" and ""the many"", which I think parallels a lot of what is being recognized by the Rainbow Warrior prophecy. 

The most ideal outcome is a synthesis of the positive aspects of the ""many"" (diversity) and the ""one"" (integration) - where indigenous, separate, and unique cultures can coexist in some sort of differentiated whole.

However, there are shadow sides to each of those. The darker side of the ""many"" is disintegration (like ""Balkanization"" - a breakdown of civil society on a planetary scale; fragmentation of families, breakdown of nations, rise of tribalism, fundamentalism, and factionalism at every level of social organization; and the darker side for ""the one"" is mass homogenization dominated by a global market mentality that reduces all human differences to a ""bottom line"" formula (the bleak vision of a global ""franchise"") and severe political correctness.

These recurrent tensions between diversity/disintegration and integration/homogenization are about to be inspected in the coming years, in part due to this ""new international leftist movement"" being formed, as well as the counter movement and these fascist leaders/dictators being elected.

Another thing discussed in the book is a prediction that religious chauvinism and ethnic hatred will replaced by the desire to become rich. However, IMO there doesn't need to be any replacement; religious chauvinism, ethnic hatred, and greed can all fuel each other.

"Economist Paul Krugman wrote, ""What we’re basically looking at ... is a balance of payments problem, in which capital flooded south after the creation of the euro, leading to overvaluation in southern Europe"" and ""In truth, this has never been a fiscal crisis at its root; it has always been a balance of payments crisis that manifests itself in part in budget problems, which have then been pushed onto the center of the stage by ideology.""

The introduction of the euro reduced trade costs among Euro countries, increasing overall trade volume. Labor costs increased more (from a lower base) in peripheral countries such as Greece relative to core countries such as Germany, eroding Greece's competitive edge. As a result, Greece's trade defecit rose significantly.

Both the Greek trade and budget defecits increased from below 5% of GDP in 1999 to peak around 15% of GDP during the crisis. A major driver of the investment inflow was Greece's membership in the EU and the Eurozone. Greece was perceived as a higher credit risk alone than it was as a member of the Eurozone, which implied investors felt the EU would bring discipline to its finances and support Greece in the event of problems.

As the American Great Recession spread to Europe, the amount of funds lent from the European core countries to the peripheral countries such as Greece began to decline. Simultaneously, reports in 2009 of Greek fiscal mismanagement and deception increased borrowing costs; the combination meant Greece could no longer borrow to finance its trade and budget defecits affordably.

A country facing a ""sudden stop"" in private investment and a high (local currency) debt load typically allows its currency to depreciate to encourage investment and to pay back the debt in cheaper currency. This was not possible while Greece remained on the Euro. Instead, to become more competitive, Greek wages fell nearly 20% from mid-2010 to 2014. This significantly reduced income and GDP, resulting in a severe recession, decline in tax receipts and a significant rise in the debt-to-gdp ratio. Unemployment reached nearly 25%, from below 10% in 2003.

"######TAX PLAN    

[BernieSanders.com](https://berniesanders.com/issues/making-the-wealthy-pay-fair-share)

**Reforming the Corporate Tax Code**  

* End the rule allowing American corporations to defer paying federal income taxes on profits of offshore subsidiaries.
* Prevent corporations from avoiding U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company through the establishment of a post office box in a tax haven country.  
* Eliminate tax breaks for big oil, gas, and coal companies.  
* Prevent American companies from avoiding U.S. taxes by corporate inversions.  
* Close loopholes that allow U.S. corporations to artificially inflate or accelerate foreign tax credits.


**Reforming the Estate Tax**

* Exempt the first $3.5 million of an individual’s estate from the estate tax.
* A 45% tax that would only impact the wealthiest 0.3% of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million. 50% for $10-$50 million of value, 55% for $50+ million, and an additional billionaire’s surtax of 10%.  

* End tax breaks for dynasty trusts.
 1. Strengthen the “generation-skipping tax” by applying it with no exclusion to any trust set up to last more than 50 years.
 2. Bar donors from taking assets back from GRATs just a couple of years after establishing them 
 3. Ensure walthy families pay income taxes on earnings generated by assets in “grantor trusts.”
 4. Sharply limit the annual exclusion from the gift tax for gifts made to trusts.

* Close other loopholes in the estate and gift tax, including valuation discounts.
* Protect farm land and conservation easements, 
 1. Allow family farmers to lower the value of their farmland by up to $3 million for estate tax purposes.
 2. Increase the maximum exclusion for conservation easements to $2 million.


**Tax Wall Street Speculators**

* Create a tax on Wall Street to significantly reduce speculation and high frequency trading. 
 1. This plan would provide a tax credit to individuals making under $50,000 and couples making under $75,000 to ensure that they would not be impacted.
 2. Trades would be taxed at a rate of 0.5% for stocks, 0.1% for bonds, and 0.005% for derivatives.


**Lift the cap on taxable income that goes into the Social Security Trust Fund**

* Tax on all income above $250,000 to expand Social Security benefits and to ensure that Social Security remains solvent for the next 58 years. 98.5% of wage earners would not see their taxes go up.  


**Reforming the Personal Income Tax**

* End Tax Breaks for Capital Gains and Dividends for the Wealthy: Repeal the special, low income tax rates on capital gains and stock dividends for married couples with incomes greater than $250,000.  

* Higher Income Tax Rates for the Wealthiest 2.1% percent of households.  
 1.  37% on income $250,000-$500,000.
  2.  43% on income $500,000-$2 million.
  3.  48% on income $2 million-$10 million.
  4.  52% on income $10 million and above. 

* Limit tax deductions for the rich: Replace the Alternative Minimum Tax, PEP, and the limit on itemized deductions with a $0.28 dollar limit on tax savings for each dollar of deductions for households with incomes above $250,000.

A tithe of **$17.46 being paid every day** of the year by workers to those making [$719,000](https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2017) or more. All the while:  

&nbsp;  

>44% of adults could not cover an emergency expense costing $400. 

>The policies pursued over the past year seem deliberately designed to remove basic protections from the poorest, punish those who are not in employment, and make even basic health care into a privilege to be earned rather than a right of citizenship. This bodes ill for for society as a whole.

>The persistence of extreme poverty is a political choice made by those in power.

######FEDERAL JOB PROGRAM

>The program pays a uniform wage of $15/h, for both part-time & full-time work... It also offers basic healthcare through and expansion of Medicare, as well as other basic benefits such as childcare—effectively establishing a minimum benefits pack.  

>The PSE program is designed to ensure that all employers pay fair (living) wages, but without competing for employees or displacing private sector undertakings.  

>The design targets job creation for workers with lower skills and education—since they have high unemployment & underemployment. PSE participation for workers with greater education and skills will be transitional until conditions improve... when labor markets are tight, employers will recruit workers out of the PSE program.  

>By design, employment in the PSE program will move in a countercyclical pattern—growing in downturns and shrinking in recoveries as workers are pulled into the private sector. This helps to stabilize economic activity and household incomes. Economists call this an automatic stabilizer. The government’s budget will also move in a countercyclical manner as spending on the program cycles with the economy. This too helps to smooth cyclical fluctuations.  


>We also see the advantages of decentralizing administration to the community level. Since the goal is to create jobs in every community, and to create projects that are beneficial to every community, it makes sense to involve the local communities in the projects from the proposal stage through to implementation, administration, & evaluation. We would allow state and local governments as well as registered nongovernmental, not-for-profits to put forth proposals.  


>Proposals can be solicited for apprenticeship programs that would train PSE workers for skilled employment outside the program after a term.  


>Scaling up to a national program that might employ 15 million workers will take time. The program will probably be phased in over a period of several years, both in terms of the numbers employed and the wages & benefits paid.  

>There are approximately 15 million potential workers who would be likely to join the program.   

>* 1 full-time worker could lift a family of up to 5 out of poverty
>* 1 full-time & 1 part-time worker, a family of 8 could rise out of poverty. 
>* In 2016, nearly 7.5 million people in families with a full-time worker lived in poverty. 
>* 9.5 million children would be lifted out of poverty. 
>* The average income gap of the 8 million families living in poverty in 2016 was $10,505—which is less than what a half-time job in the PSE would pay. 
>* Direct spending on the program is just below 2.5% of GDP per year. (Excluding increases in tax revenue due to economic growth as well as potential savings on a wide range of federal, state, and local programs that are targeted to low-income households. In 2015 for example, the federal government spent  $104  billion  on  food and nutritional service programs.)

"We have 5% of the population of the world, but 35% of the military spending.

Our spending is of course highest in the world, but it is more than the totals of #2 through #10 combined (those other 9 countries, btw, coming to more than 10x our population).

Meanwhile, our population suffers from a reprehensible level of healthcare service, higher education funding, and transportation infrastructure, for example- repeatedly explained as a result of ""not enough funding""

So, yeah, reducing nonsensical defense spending is, in fact, a very reasonable goal in and of itself.  I agree that underfunding what we need to do is a bad idea, and I agree that we need to be involved in fewer conflicts.  But I think, if you look at our spending in context, it's clear that the spending is more than just a downstream impact of the conflicts.  In fact, I can't help but wonder if our leadership's willingness to enter I to conflict isn't integrally tied to the perception of defense as a blank check.

"Which vote was that?

**Concerning the basing of the F-35 program:**

I found this published [here](https://vtdigger.org/2017/03/08/rosanne-greco-5-way-win-solution-airport-noise-problems/) on March 8^th '17:  
  
>Court documents show that Sen. Patrick Leahy phoned the Air Force chief of staff and told him to base the F-35 in Vermont. Sen. Leahy and Sen. Bernie Sanders both stated they supported the F-35 basing because the F-35 was essential for VTANG’s future. Court documents show this reason was incorrect. The senators, along with many other Vermonters, were misled to believe that VTANG needed the F-35 to continue to have a mission. Federal and legal documents, as well as sworn testimony from the U.S. Air Force, show unequivocally that VTANG will continue to have a flying mission whether or not the F-35 is based here.  

I don't think there was a vote but the Air Force announced their intent to seek basing locations [here](http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/111369/air-force-officials-release-draft-eis-for-f-35-operational-basing.aspx), and [here](http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/111369/air-force-officials-release-draft-eis-for-f-35-operational-basing.aspx) announced:  

>The current active Air Force and Air National Guard alternatives under consideration are: Burlington Air Guard Station, Vt.; Hill Air Force Base, Utah; Jacksonville Air Guard Station, Fla.; Mountain Home AFB, Idaho; and Shaw AFB/McEntire Joint National Guard Base, S.C.

>...The draft EIS for the F-35A operational locations opens a 45-day public comment period. The Air Force will conduct 17 public hearings at locations surrounding the potentially impacted communities to receive oral and written comments on the draft EIS.  

[Here's](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/release-air-national-guard-to-be-first-f-35-joint-strike-fighter-base ) Senator Sanders' [statements](

>It is a sign of the great national respect and admiration for the Vermont National Guard that it was selected by the Air Force in a very competitive process.    

~

>The Air Force has made clear that this aircraft, which will anchor our national air defenses, is the Air Force’s future.  Now the men and women of Vermont’s Air National Guard have been chosen for a vital role in that future.  The decision ensures the Vermont Air Guard’s continuing mission and protects hundreds of jobs and educational opportunities for Vermonters while securing its significant contribution to the local economy.

a lot of Americans should start comparing the cost of health care in the states to other first world country's and pointing the finger at the health racket you guys have set up which has led to you guys paying enormous prices. You live in a society. Stop spending so much on defense and start spending more on social aspects in your country.,midved,e8myq55,SandersForPresident
"I think you’re missing a lot of tertiary benefits to providing health care to everyone, and totally ignoring any of the research that shows it would actually cost you less money to cover everyone.  

A healthier population uses less care, especially later in life.  That alone would offset costs dramatically for everyone paying into a Medicare for all system.  

Almost as important as a healthier population, cost controls over profiteering pharmaceutical companies, price gouging medical clinics and hospitals, and unnecessary testing and procedures is a huge part of the problem.  Having state and federal power to contain those costs and set sensible pricing for medical care is a must, and it is not going to happen unless we legislate it.  Medicare for all would provide that opportunity.  

In the end you do end up paying for the people who don’t have health care.  You pay for it when your insurance premiums go up as hospitals have to charge more for uninsured patients that can’t pay bills.  You pay for it when society deals with unhealthy people that make unhealthy choices like drugs, or crime because they do not have their basic needs met.  

You pay for it all, and on top of the money that goes to paying for patient care you are paying the obscene amounts of money that go to line the pockets of the executives and shareholders of insurance, pharmaceutical, and patient care corporations.  

Medicare for all would dramatically lessen the cost of administering insurance, primarily because the profit motive would no longer siphon off premiums for profit, and because we have way too many small insurance markets with duplicated efforts.  This is a huge reason we can actually save money and cover everyone at the same time. 

Medicare for all is not only the right step from a moral and human perspective, it’s also the most conservative approach to containing the cost of administering health care.  The market approach to health insurance and pricing of care is by all accounts a massive failure, as many privatized forms of delivering basic needs eventually become.

"Don't forget [Ballot Measures](https://ourrevolution.com/ballot-initiatives/) <--- Our Revolution Endorsements please check other sidebar guides too.

[@BernieSanders:](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1056670125909250053)

* Today, I would like to endorse some of the ballot measures in states across the country. 

 California: Proposition 10  
 Florida: Amendment 4  
 Colorado: YES on Amendment 73 and Proposition 112 and NO on Amendment 74  
 Massachusetts: Question 1  
 Washington: Initiative 1631  

  Thread 👇

* Currently California cities and towns aren't permitted to pass rent control measures to address the affordable housing crisis. That should change. Municipalities should have the freedom to deal with the decline in affordable housing and rising rents. Let's pass Prop 10.

* How is it possible that in Colorado a majority of school districts can only afford to keep their schools open 4 days a week? How are teachers paid wages so low that some have to work two jobs to survive? Our kids deserve a high-quality education. Amendment 73 is a no-brainer.

* Colorado Amendment 74, pushed by the fossil fuel industry, seems to be one of the most dangerous propositions in the country. It could open the flood gates for oil, gas and other corporate interests to bankrupt the state. This extremely dangerous amendment must be defeated.

* Given the crisis we face with climate change, in my view we should move toward a total ban on fracking. At a minimum, it seems obvious that we must protect communities from the environmental damage that fracking causes. In my view Colorado voters should support 112.

* Florida has the opportunity to re-enfranchise 1.4 million formerly incarcerated people to fully participate as citizens. Passing Amendment 4 is an important step for both voting rights and criminal justice reform.

* Question 1 in Massachusetts would set a safe maximum on the number of patients nurses can treat, so that patients can receive the quality care they deserve. Nurses are behind this initiative, and I trust them when it comes to knowing what is best for their patients.

* With the recent report from the IPCC noting the drastic action required to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, Initiative 1631 is an important step forward for the people of Washington State.

* I want to thank the many activists I met with who informed me about these important ballot measures nationwide which can help us create a fairer and just society. We must rise to the historic occasion and make sure we have record voter turnout so we can transform this nation.

I'd like to offer an important point in this regard, as well: just because American exceptionalism is an ongoing atrocity (which it is) doesn't mean that America isn't, or at least that we *can't be*, a net force for good.

This is important precisely because there is no such thing as ending empire. There is only the change of the guard. If we step aside on purpose, who takes the reins? Russia and China.

For your last thing tho.  Countries around the world are retreating from the traditional world order in diplomacy.  That’s my other fear; its a spiral of downward armament that ends with someone shooting.  And it’s not just us.  

If we decrease our budget, we face a Europe fearful of Russia and a Pacific fearful of China.  The result is that those countries will pounce on our perceived weakness, and expand their influence to bully and coerce other countries.  

If we arm, then other countries will see us as a worse threat.  So I’m not sure what you speak of when you say diplomatic efforts.  It’s the hope of every incoming president and the failure of each outgoing one.

>We are seeing movements led by demagogues who exploit people’s fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power.

>Just this past weekend, in Brazil’s presidential election, right-wing leader Jair Bolsonaro, who has been called “The Donald Trump of Brazil,” made a very strong showing in the first round of voting, coming up just short of an outright victory. Bolsonaro has a long record of attacks against immigrants, against minorities, against women, against LGBT people.   

>Bolsonaro, who has said he loves Donald Trump, has praised Brazil’s former military dictatorship, and has said, among other things, that in order to deal with crime, police should simply be allowed to shoot more criminals. This is the person who may soon lead the world’s fifth most populous country, and its ninth largest economy.

>Meanwhile, Brazil’s most popular politician, the former president Lula da Silva, is imprisoned on highly questionable charges, and prevented from running again.

>Bolsonaro in Brazil is one example, there are others which I will discuss. But I think it is important that we understand that what we are seeing now in the world is the rise of a new authoritarian axis.

>While the leaders who make up this axis may differ in some respects, they share key attributes: intolerance toward ethnic and religious minorities, hostility toward democratic norms, antagonism toward a free press, constant paranoia about foreign plots, and a belief that the leaders of government should be able use their positions of power to serve their own selfish financial interests.

>Interestingly, many of these leaders are also deeply connected to a network of multi-billionaire oligarchs who see the world as their economic plaything.

>Those of us who believe in democracy, who believe that a government must be accountable to its people and not the other way around, must understand the scope of this challenge if we are to confront it effectively. We need to counter oligarchic authoritarianism with a strong global progressive movement that speaks to the needs of working people, that recognizes that many of the problems we are faced with are the product of a failed status quo. We need a movement that unites people all over the world who don’t just seek to return to a romanticized past, a past that did not work for so many, but who strive for something better.

>While this authoritarian trend certainly did not begin with Donald Trump, there’s no question that other authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the president of the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy is shattering democratic norms, is viciously attack an independent media and an independent judiciary, and is scapegoating the weakest and most vulnerable members of our society.",Chartis,e8p3joy,SandersForPresident

"* Currently California cities and towns aren't permitted to pass rent control measures to address the affordable housing crisis. That should change. Municipalities should have the freedom to deal with the decline in affordable housing and rising rents. Let's pass Prop 10.

* How is it possible that in Colorado a majority of school districts can only afford to keep their schools open 4 days a week? How are teachers paid wages so low that some have to work two jobs to survive? Our kids deserve a high-quality education. Amendment 73 is a no-brainer.

* Colorado Amendment 74, pushed by the fossil fuel industry, seems to be one of the most dangerous propositions in the country. It could open the flood gates for oil, gas and other corporate interests to bankrupt the state. This extremely dangerous amendment must be defeated.

* Given the crisis we face with climate change, in my view we should move toward a total ban on fracking. At a minimum, it seems obvious that we must protect communities from the environmental damage that fracking causes. In my view Colorado voters should support 112.

* Florida has the opportunity to re-enfranchise 1.4 million formerly incarcerated people to fully participate as citizens. Passing Amendment 4 is an important step for both voting rights and criminal justice reform.

* Question 1 in Massachusetts would set a safe maximum on the number of patients nurses can treat, so that patients can receive the quality care they deserve. Nurses are behind this initiative, and I trust them when it comes to knowing what is best for their patients.

* With the recent report from the IPCC noting the drastic action required to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, Initiative 1631 is an important step forward for the people of Washington State.

* I want to thank the many activists I met with who informed me about these important ballot measures nationwide which can help us create a fairer and just society. We must rise to the historic occasion and make sure we have record voter turnout so we can transform this nation.

The left wants to do all we can to stop Climate Change. The Republicans pull us out of international climate agreements and try to destroy the EPA. Democrats think the solution to gun violence is to have fewer guns. The Republicans have decided to follow their NRA donors and claim that having more guns would somehow reduce gun violence. Democrats want to improve public schools and allow all students to attend college without going into massive debt. Republicans want to move funding from public school and move it to private religious schools while opposing all effort to make college more affordable. Progressives think the solution to our awful healthcare system is to follow the lead of every industrialized country and institute a publicly funded health insurance system. The Republicans think that removing regulations and reversing the small improvements made by the Obama administration will somehow fix things. They also just fundamentally disagree with the idea that everyone should have health insurance. The Republicans literally think that a system where thousands die yearly because they’re uninsured while many more go bankrupt is better than a more affordable system that save us money and keeps everyone healthier.,WhoAteMyPasghetti,e8ojpex,SandersForPresident

Money is made by the treasury when an issuing government authorizes a budget. [That enables production of the currency by underutilized workers, resources, & production capacity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/9papuq/stephanie_kelton_but_how_will_we_pay_for_it/e80lj35/) If there is less production and more purchasers the supply becomes limited and inflation occurs. This program is an excellent way to produce wealth and avoid inflation:  



>The program pays a uniform wage of $15/h, for both part-time & full-time work... It also offers basic healthcare through and expansion of Medicare, as well as other basic benefits such as childcare—effectively establishing a minimum benefits pack.  


>The PSE program is designed to ensure that all employers pay fair (living) wages, but without competing for employees or displacing private sector undertakings.  


>The design targets job creation for workers with lower skills and education—since they have high unemployment & underemployment. PSE participation for workers with greater education and skills will be transitional until conditions improve... when labor markets are tight, employers will recruit workers out of the PSE program.  


>By design, employment in the PSE program will move in a countercyclical pattern—growing in downturns and shrinking in recoveries as workers are pulled into the private sector. This helps to stabilize economic activity and household incomes. Economists call this an automatic stabilizer. The government’s budget will also move in a countercyclical manner as spending on the program cycles with the economy. This too helps to smooth cyclical fluctuations.  


>We also see the advantages of decentralizing administration to the community level. Since the goal is to create jobs in every community, and to create projects that are beneficial to every community, it makes sense to involve the local communities in the projects from the proposal stage through to implementation, administration, & evaluation. We would allow state and local governments as well as registered nongovernmental, not-for-profits to putforth proposals.  


>We expect that most of the jobs created will provide public services in nonprofit community organizations, public schools, and state & local governments. PSE workers could be used for very small public works projects (installing  playground equipment), simple maintenance  of  infrastructure  (planting vegetation as screening), and environmental retrofitting (adding insulation to housing in low-income neighborhoods or to community  buildings). A number of proposals for creation of workers’ cooperatives could be solicited. 


>Proposals can be solicited for apprenticeship programs that would train PSE workers for skilled employment outside the program after a term.  


>Scaling up to a national program that might employ 15 million workers will take time. The program will probably be phased in over a period of several years, both in terms of the numbers employed and the wages & benefits paid.  

>There are approximately 15 million potential workers who would be likely to join the program.   

>* 1 full-time worker could lift a family of up to 5 out of poverty
>* 1 full-time & 1 part-time worker, a family of 8 could rise out of poverty. 
>* In 2016, nearly 7.5 million people in families with a full-time worker lived in poverty. 
>* 9.5 million children would be lifted out of poverty. 
>* The average income gap of the 8 million families living in poverty in 2016 was $10,505—which is less than what a half-time job in the PSE would pay. 
>* Direct spending on the program is just below 2.5% of GDP per year. (Excluding increases in tax revenue due to economic growth as well as potential savings on a wide range of federal, state, and local programs that are targeted to low-income households. In 2015 for example, the federal government spent  $104  billion  on  food and nutritional service programs.)  

---

TL;DR:  

* It's decentralized to ensure that it serves workers as well as the communities in which they live.  
* The program pays $15/h plus benefits, establishing a nationwide effective minimum compensation level.  
* It does not compete with private employers, beyond setting minimum labor standards.  
* Employment in the program moves countercyclically, against business cycle swings, helping to stabilize consumption, output, income, and employment.  
* In cyclical upswings, private employers recruit workers out of the program; in downturns, the program absorbs workers shed by private employers.  
* Access to paid work eliminates most poverty, making it easier to deal with the poverty that remains.

"Interesting.

Varoufakis's position during the Greek financial crisis was that the (mostly Germain-led) bailouts of Greece really weren't about bailing out Greece, they were about bailing out German banks that made bad investments in Greece (in part because Greece was, with the assistance of Goldman Sachs, able to conceal the magnitude of their debt).  In effect, it was a financial transaction that shifted money from German taxpayers to German banks.  The ""bailouts"" would have imposed extreme financial austerity on Greece (i.e. turned it into a libertarian utopia with little funding for social services, education, and so on).

Greece eventually hired Varoufakis as finance minister, and in that position he advocated that it would be better for Greece to declare bankruptcy than accept the terms of the bailout they were offered.  There was a referendum on accepting bailout terms, which was rejected by voters.  Varoufakis resigned (because Greece's creditors hated him and wanted him gone).  Shortly thereafter, the Greek government accepted bailout terms harsher than the ones rejected by voters in the referendum.

Sometimes I wonder if Greece isn't a preview of the United States...  One generation doesn't want to pay the taxes to support all the various government programs they benefit from, thereby selling the future generations into financial slavery.  Then, when the money/credit runs out, all those social programs get killed or drastically reduced.  Just about 2 weeks ago, Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for the horrendous deficit we're running because they haven't drastically reduced Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid spending to compensate for their tax breaks for the wealthy.  It's as if he sees Greece as an example to aspire to, to achieve his aim of getting rid of those wasteful social programs that don't do anything to maximize shareholder value or whatever it is he thinks is the policy objective of the United States government.

It'll be interesting to see what Bernie and Varoufakis can accomplish together.  This took me by surprise, but in retrospect it makes a lot of sense.",elihu,e8n52zw,SandersForPresident

Okay, so there has to have been more criteria than that. Were they located in the same area? What age groups were these folks in and was there a difference between respondents in different age groups? 

For this questionnaire how are they mapping people onto a left/right spectrum? Medicare for all for example is supported by majorities of Democrats, independents and republicans. Would support for that policy or other broadly popular policies that are shunned by conservative Democrats label them as 'left' in this paper?

It isn't clear to me what meaningful conversation you are trying to provoke here. Throughout the last presidential campaign conservative Democrats tried to argue that sexism was responsible for Bernie's popularity and ignored the fact that he was far more progressive and supported more progressive policies than Clinton. 

Sexism no doubt was a factor here but the title of a study based on self reporting and hidden behind a paywall reeks of scapegoating to avoid coming to terms with the other issues with that particular candidate. ",Forestthetree,e8oapod,SandersForPresident

">And in doing so he's reminded us that this election is certainly not about the gender of the candidate.

What do you suggest as remedy?,Chartis,e8o4u7b,SandersForPresident
"This is a difficult question to answer to be honest. I would suggest recognizing the role sexism has had is the first step needed to fix this problem. We can't just ignore sexism and say ""ignore gender"" because one's implicit biases will impede such a strategy. As i mention, people seldom call themselves a sexist and will assume they choose to dislike someone for other reasons; even if sexism really is controlling their behavior.

I'd argue this was evident in the Sander/Clinton primary aftermath considering Clintons views/voting history were similar to Sanders, the only difference being how she wanted to get there. Yet, the primary was much more toxic than it should have been and I would argue this was due primarily to implicit sexism. Even if Clinton wasnt a perfect choice, I would argue that it is objectively wrong to say she was bad if you liked Sanders for his views; especially compared to trump.",Thegg11,e8o5fji,SandersForPresident
After that recognition what's the path forward?,Chartis,e8o5yy7,SandersForPresident
"This is getting outside of my area of expertise, but I would say creating a behavioral plan to combat sexism. One misinterpretation of sexism is assuming that it is an entity inside of someone as opposed to a list of different types of behavior (speaking is behavior as well). If we assume that it is an entity inside of someone, we cannot make a concrete plan to address it as we can only assume it ""goes away"" as opposed to fully demonstrating it actually has.

This is why a behavioral plan is more important; one would need to define what sexism is using behavioral examples (the assessment used in the study does this to some extent). A simple example would be how often one uses the words ""bitch/cunt"" towards a woman in power. Creating a plan such as: if you do not say ""bitch/cunt"" to women, you get X. 

Now, you would have to do this for a wide variety of behavior; but this demonstrates why recognizing sexism is so important; you can't just say ""he is sexist,"" and assume people know what that means; you have to say ""he is sexist because he says that Clinton is a cunt who should go to jail."" Furthermore, you can't actually address sexist behavior without successfully identifying it.",Thegg11,e8o6hmq,SandersForPresident
"Is your suggestion of a behavior plan for individuals to develop?

",Chartis,e8o7s5y,SandersForPresident
"There really isnt a great group solution that I am aware of (mostly because trying to change individual behavior without looking at the individual contingencies involved can be difficult). A behavioral plan simply means using a procedure established by behavioral psychology; the example I gave involves a DRO procedure (getting something after not engaging in a certain behavior for a set amount of time), but there are a lot of other possibilities. I mentioned individual plans because we realistically do not have the means to produce societal wide behavioral change all at once (even if we could create an effective group wide plan), instead we could only do so with individuals willing to engage in the plan.

Although you could attempt to discourage sexist behavior of others by calling it out; this may not always be the most effective solution considering the back fire effect (also something that happened a lot during the 2016 primaries).",Thegg11,e8o87sd,SandersForPresident
"What do you recommend giving people who do not use those terms?

>  * to have 30 million Americans with no health insurance & even more who are under-insured with high deductibles and high co-payments. 
>  * to have millions of Americans get sicker than they should, and in some cases die, because they can’t afford to go to the doctor.

">""Medicare for all"" has been a headline in his speeches and campaigns. Just looking for some insight as to why things are wrong with what we have going on now. 

You're asking what's wrong with the current US healthcare system? 

",MissMeWThatScreenSht,e8i1svn,SandersForPresident
"We pay twice as much for healthcare as any other developed nation and we have worse health outcomes. Consider that an MRI in the USA cost 2500-3000 USD, and in Germany or Canada, it costs 400-700 USD. Germany has a multi-payer system and Canada has a single-payer system similar to what Bernie is proposing. 

The German system happens to be structured similarly to how the US system is now. The major difference is that 70% of the German health insurance industry is non-profit, whereas in the US it is almost entirely commercialized (for profit). Germany also has laws in place to guarantee coverage for a variety of conditions that in the states is left to the discretion of the insurance company, meaning if they don't want to cover your treatment costs, they don't have to. 

America for whatever reason pays substantially less than any other nation on civil services like housing, retirement, and welfare which has long been proven to be one of the best methods of preventative care. 

Whether you believe in single payer or multipayer, mandatory or opt-in health care. One thing is certain, our health care system as it currently stands is broken and not sustainable long term.",SLowfalls,e8iep5y,SandersForPresident
"The very short version is that we pay more per capita for healthcare than comparable countries that use single payer and we tend to get worse health outcomes than those countries. It’s simply an inefficient system. 

Inefficiency aside, it seems immoral that in the richest country in the history of the world, people are going bankrupt because they get sick. People choose between treatment for themselves or a loved one and paying basic utility bills. Universal healthcare would address a lot of that immorality and would save us money in the process.

"My take on this specific proposal depends on what he has to deal with.  If Hillary Clinton actually runs again or if she makes a great effort to obstruct Bernie's efforts, then he certainly should respond with starkly honest critique of the 2016 train wreck he did everything in his power to avert.  The slogan would be a clear signal that a choice between speaking the truth or uniting the party is no choice at all for an honest leader.

On the other hand, if there is legitimate party unity at stake -- if the process of primaries and debates sees other Democratic candidates quick to bow out and endorse Senator Sanders -- then a confrontational slogan could do more harm than good.  We all know who could not read an Electoral College map as well as Kellyanne Conway in 2016.  Putting a fine point on it is only useful if the incompetence of the past continues to actively obstruct American progress.",Demonweed,e8jkzbh,SandersForPresident
"Gotta start first off by saying I've wanted Sanders to be president since 2007.  I voted for him in the primaries.  I helped GOTV.  I'm a Sanders man.  That being said, a lot of what you said here is just plain wrong or at least very misguided.

Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders are not compatible save for a couple of issues.  That will go nowhere.  Given Rand Paul's previous statements and actions (not just with Russia but general voting), his leadership is not wanted or needed.  Rand Paul is a trumpublican.

Trump never wanted to debate anyone. Hell it's questionable that he even wanted to actually win. This was plainly obvious as we got to the general.  He only said those things about Bernie because he, like many others, had the gut feeling that Hillary was going to win the primary anyway.  He was stoking division and fear in the Democratic primary process.  Besides, even if it was someone with whom he'd truly want to debate, he'd only want it because he would think it ""easy"".  And by ""easy"", we know that means he'd attempt to bully him and bend every rule because Sanders is rather honest for a politician.  There were no warm feelings, no ""secret connection"".   Trump isn't a populist - he's a nationalist.  He said so himself in front of tons of cameras just a few days ago.  There are big differences between a true populist and a nationalist.  You know who else were nationalists?  Hitler and Mussolini.  Trump will say whatever garbage gets him applause from some of the worst of humanity, and those who don't fall in line 100% are the ""enemy"".

So ""in lieu"" of all the facts - that is since the start of his presidency where he has done everything to stoke divisions within our people and our international allies, calling his political opponents ""enemies of the people"", continued wars, accepting hundreds of billions of dollars in arms deals from countries that murder journalists simply because ""it's a good deal"" - you still think Hillary is more ""evil""?  Regardless of how you interpret what Hillary said in the campaign, there are clear actions by which we can judge them.  And by that, Trump has demonstrated an almost vitriolic hatred for anyone who doesn't get on board his bullshit 100%.  And now with the longstanding nuclear arms deal about to be thrown out the window, who is actually the evil one wanting nuclear war?  Who has kept our troops in Syria?  Who encourages violence against fellow Americans?  Why I do believe that would be our CURRENT so-called president.  Trump has shown no real compassion, no real desire to lead - only rule, no desire to unify - only divide.  He would have Canada and Mexico be our enemies while thuggish, BULLYING rulers like Putin, Xi and Duterte are his role models.  

Was Hillary great?  Probably not.  She said some dumb things.  That usually happens in a relatively normal campaign process.  I'm not saying Hillary was a saint or not a warhawk - it's one of the reasons I couldn't vote for her in the primary.  But if you think I voted for Trump over Hillary in the general you're mad.  Trump showed us his true colors early on. He is no populist.

I'm going to jump over the conspiracy nut stuff and go right to this ""new world"" business. While it's a commendable goal to want to be a shining example to the world, it's harder to do in practice when the place is being run by a flaming turd who brings out the worst we have to offer.  ""Western World"" or ""New World"", all of that is over now.  Business and trade are global, culture is global, communication is global, humanity is global.  

We can all agree denuclearization is a great goal, but it's harder to do in practice when we have demonstrably horrid leaders who would like nothing more than to acquire and/or use such weapons to exercise power.  Denuclearization is a process that requires all sides cooperating in a joint effort.

Trump and the republicans have destroyed any notion of America being a beacon or shining example of anything for many years to come.  Countries will be looking elsewhere to share resources and support.

Oh please. This is a right-wing talking point that tries to hide America's history of oppression. It's disappointing to see a so-called ""progressive"" subreddit repeating this non-sense talking point.

The democratic party was complicit in the exploitation of migrant workers including the support for the policies which destabilized those countries. They supported NAFTA which destabilized Mexico workforce. They supported a coup in Honduras. 

 Obama was called [the deporter in cheif](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-deportation-machine-obama-built-for-president-trump/). [the democratic party support the harsh crime laws](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/bill-clinton-crime-bill-hillary-black-lives-thomas-frank) and [deregulation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/wall-street-deregulation-clinton-advisers-obama). [The democratic party just decided to take fossil fuel money again](http://time.com/5365422/democratic-party-fossil-fuel-contributions-labor/)

We have been experiencing a corporate takeover of our system for decades. If you find yourself just blaming Republicans, then you're probably a victim of partisan propaganda. I'm not doing a false equivalence. But it's clear the Republicans aren't the only problem.

We're not talking about building a perfect world. We're talking about fighting against the corporate takeover of our system which has to include the democratic party.

Your entire argument was nothing but democratic establishment talking points. That holding the democratic party accountable means we want to get rid of the entire system and are looking for the perfect instead of the good. That we should blame voters who decided to vote for Trump or third party.

What does say much about him are his efforts to help people and Bernie's warranted trust in his worth as a worker and as a person.  

The reason Bernie is vocal about Russia is clear: To move to protect American democracy by enacting sanctions, preventing interference with the independent investigation, rally public support, and to help protect democracy worldwide.  

Bernie has been supportive of social media companies ensuring appropriate regulation of their platforms in this general regard.

.......................................

>But apathy and laziness aren’t the main causes of low attendance at real, bona-fide Left protests and demonstrations (as opposed to coopted-by-the-Democratic Party marches like the annual January 20th Women’s Marches against Trump).

>Our real problem is that there isn’t a real, bona-fide Left journalism outlet in the United States.

>One that’s smart, i.e., well-managed. Not in the derpy leaderless consensus style that destroyed the Occupy movement, but top-down by brilliant Machiavellian can’t-be-bought leftist schemers who know how to motivate and build an organization.

>One that’s well-funded. Not by some control-freak billionaire who can petulantly renege on his big promises after he loses interest or gets corrupted, but by generous ongoing crowdsourcing that guarantees editorial independence to an uncompromisingly left-wing team of editors with big budgets to hire kickass investigative reporters, back out-of-the-box journalists, humorists and editorialists. 

.....................................................

>One that’s entertaining. The way FoxNews and Rush Limbaugh are entertaining but MSNBC and Air America aren’t/weren’t. Because humor and entertainment are what attract new readers/listeners/watchers and keep loyalists coming back.

>I only heard about the Women’s March on the Pentagon one day before. It was by happenstance. (I live in New York, six hours from DC, but like most people I can’t just drop everything and skip town with a night’s notice.)

>That’s ridiculous.

>I’ve been a leftie cartoonist and columnist for nearly three decades. Yet I have hardly ever received an email from a left-leaning organization inviting me to publicize or attend or cover a protest demonstration, or a press release explaining that one was about to occur. I’ve asked other pundits; they never hear from the Left either.

>Meanwhile I’m constantly getting talking point lists, action memos, press releases and all sorts of sundry propaganda from right-wing organizations as well as the mainline Republican and Democratic party apparatuses. Which is all redundant because all that crap gets ample coverage on cable news, network news, talk radio, NPR, newspapers and news websites, not to mention social media.

>I don’t need more junk email. Point is, my leftism-free inbox is a barometer of the state of the Left: disorganized and disconnected and incapable of broadcasting its message. If a protest march falls in the woods—or on the Washington Mall—does it make a sound? Not if the word doesn’t get out. Not if no one reports it after the fact.

......................................................

>**Grassroots organizing will never build into 1960s-level mass demonstrations without big, rich, smart, cool media distribution channels to give it space to breathe and expand.**

>**First, we need a big-ass left-wing media group to educate people about what’s going on.** You can’t expect people to get riled up about what the U.S. is doing in Yemen if they don’t know what’s going on there. Mainstream corporate media doesn’t cover the U.S. role in the proxy civil war.

>Second, to redefine what’s “normal.” In the current media landscape, opposing war is abnormal. That message is subliminal: when’s the last time, during a foreign policy crisis, that a mainstream pundit suggested the U.S. simply stay out of it? A smart, well-funded, entertaining-as-hell media organization would provide an alternative to the establishment narrative. You can’t dream of peace if it’s not in your brain as a possibility in the first place.

............................................................

>**In the 1960s the corporate mainstream media allowed antiwar, pro-civil rights and other antiestablishment journalists and pundits to disseminate their views on TV (Cronkite criticizing the Vietnam War), on the opinion pages of major newspapers and in bestselling books. And they covered protests.**

>**No more. The Left has been ruthlessly purged.**

>**Not one single opinion writer or staff columnist or cartoonist employed by an American newspaper is a real, bonafide leftist—not a single one even supported Bernie Sanders (whose politics are basically McGovern in 1972 and was supported by half of Democrats) during the 2016 primaries.**

>**Not one single TV or major radio talk show host is a real, bonafide leftist. None supported Bernie.**

>**The same goes for “liberal” outlets like The Atlantic, Salon, Slate, etc.**

>**It’s censorship. It’s systemic. It’s killing the Left.**

>Considering that it’s impossible for the Left to get coverage for anything, it’s a miracle that 1,500 people showed up for the Women’s March on the Pentagon.

>If we had a real, smart, well-funded, organized media organization to publicize the news and the world from a socialist or communist viewpoint—an ideology shared by at least one out of three American voters overall and 57% of Democrats—there could easily have been 150,000 or 1,500,000.

"In another thread someone commented about how progressives didn't win a ton of federal seats during this election year and so that had them feeling down a bit.  But it seemed like concern trolling because they pretended like all the state level victories we've had didn't much matter.  So I'll leave my comment below from that thread because I think it addresses some or many of your concerns:

We first have to remember that this is a marathon not a sprint and that change takes place from the bottom up. It may take 10 years or more to fully implement the most important progressive agenda policies.

It may not seem like it from a federal election point of view but from a policy point of view we've already seen massive progressive victories in a very short amount of time. 70% of Americans now support medicare for all, 66% support legalizing marijuana, and 60% support publicly funded college. Many cities and now Amazon have raised their minimum wage to $15/hr. Most of these positions were considered radical or extreme by the corporate mainstream media just two short years ago.

I think it is a mistake to exclude lower state races as important as those victories significantly increase the progressive bench of candidates that can go on to federal office in the near future. Also, that a democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders was competitive for POTUS in 2016 and now is consistently at the top of the polls for 2020 is a massive victory for the progressive movement.

It's also important to remember that the establishment has way more money, they have the media, they have the name recognition and they have a pre-existing network of corporate supporting hacks, so in other words it will be extremely difficult to dislodge them at the federal level and yet we are seeing some of these victories take place. I can't recall the exact statistic but incumbent politicians have a large advantage from just being the incumbent alone, so it's already an uphill battle just taking on the current seated politician in any race.

Recall that Bernie did extremely well with the younger people of our country. As time goes by we lose more of the conservative voters and gain more progressive voters.

Also, midterm elections typically don't see the turnout that presidential elections do, yet we still had some federal election victories and tons of state level victories. Many are thinking that 2018 was just the appetizer for how progressives will do in 2020.

Remember too that change in politics was by design suppose to be tedious and agonizingly slow to behold. We're more impatient than ever with the pace of tech upgrades these days but on the other hand that tech is also helping to fuel change faster than ever before.

The progressive movement has made great progress in a very short amount of time and as long as we keep pushing and don't become disengaged we will see more and more progressive victories in the future, count on it.

The way things are currently, were playing a numbers game with trying to retake congress in the midterms, and i'd rather a blue dog democrat than any republican get those seats to place an appropriate check on the administration.

Currently as a party, we're not in a position to hold purity tests as the Trump admin is in control of all 3 branches, and i would hope most progressives can recognize this. For the time being, run progressives in the primary, and vote for whatever dem comes out on top, as a conservative will most likely vote much more for the Trump policies than a dem would, even if its a neoliberal dem. We need to unify as a party to regain some control and have some checks put into place. IMO, our highest priority should be reigning in the current admin, and only then should we focus on filling every seat with progressives. We can't afford another ""X progressive or bust"" movement, cause look where that's gotten us.

">As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties. -- James Madison

http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp

Bonus:

>But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.

If anything?  *That's* what is killing America.  I mean, people are going to have competing interests.  But the government is failing to property regulate *between* those competing interests.

It's devolved to factionalism:  ""We're only going to do things that benefit *us;* even if it comes at the expense of *them.*  The common good be damned.""

"> If Johnson had been running all by himself, he would not have been acceptable to anyone.

So they created a ghastly alternative. And it had the whole world — including people who call themselves Marxists — hoping that Johnson would beat Goldwater.

A government can’t really be effective when it’s a constant competition of lesser evils either, nor can the voters really keep up enthusiasm for that system even if it were functional. Asking people to put faith in a system that has been obviously broken for (at least) decades is a hard sell, and it is so for a reason.

>By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

>It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole.

>The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its EFFECTS.

>If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.

>By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression. 

Which basically seems to translate to ""don't let the majority get powerful enough to be able to oppress the minority.""  But, well, *that's really hard to do.*

Class war wasn't invented in the 60s.  Or, by a 19th century German philosopher.  It's as old as the concept of property.

Seeing as revolutions where the rich get eaten by the poor (after copious bloodletting) don't tend to work out very well, but a system where the rich just get to eat the poor isn't great, either, the solution would be to *try to find a way to regulate between the factions.*

Find a middle ground that seems pretty fair to all parties involved.

Because a zero-sum representative democracy *does not function.*  It can't, really.

In fact, the more it favors any one group (the rich, white people, whatever...), the more it fails as system. ",ting_bu_dong,e8im427,SandersForPresident

"Class is never going to be a win win. Mitigating the damage of the losses does not make a loss into a win. Abolishing class is the only way to remove the issues class creates. 

And while liberalism doesn’t explicitly endorse one group or another, as a system it allows groups to maintain control over other groups. 

That’s also pretty explicitly not what King said. 

And of course class didn’t start with Marx, but Marxist styles of analysis did. Marx’s whole premise was to analyze class relations as they develop from their historic counterparts, so from a Marxist perspective it’s obvious that class preceded the analysis of class.

">There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.

>It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.

>The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.

It's not advisable to try to abolish groups.  You'd need to either convince everyone to agree to the same (your) point of view, or forcefully prevent them from being able to have a different one. 

And even if you magage to do this?

>The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts.

People will just divide themselves based on other reasons. The inner versus outer party, for instance.

Class is a faction, but it isn't the only one. Even if you get rid of it, you aren't getting rid of the reason behind it:  People are tribalistic, and thus prone to forming groups, coalitions, parties, classes, nations, empires... 

And then beating other groups over the head.

So, I mean, I get why you want to make things better for lower classes by destroying the distinction, essentially destroying the upper class.  

It stands to reason that that you support your *chosen group,* as much as it stands to reason that the rich would try to screw you.

I'm saying that the only real solution for a workable democratic, representative government is to tell both sides in the class war to go screw themselves. 

The problem, really, is that the government is picking sides, playing favorites. The rich's side. ",ting_bu_dong,e8ipafy,SandersForPresident

"How is one view not already in place by force? Again, liberalism allows that to occur even if it doesn’t endorse it explicitly. I have the liberty to talk about communism or anarchy all day, but at the end of the day the material conditions I operate under are capitalism. This isn’t really decided by voting or representation, but by the authority of ownership. That ownership is constantly backed by the threat of force. Choosing not to acknowledge it will lead to violent reprisals. 

Do you think the abolition of feudal relations was a net negative? People died, some gruesomely. It was a violent period to replace global feudalism with global capitalism. Were the improvements not worth it? Is ideological pacifism more important than progressive violence? 

The idea of telling both classes to screw themselves is some radical centrist nonsense. Everyone exists with some relationship to production and property. THats a material reality that can’t be not true. Wanting to ignore it means you’re in a privileged enough position to be able to ignore it. That’s not enlightened, it’s patronizing.

     A good government will work to prevent groups from oppressing other groups.

The groups are arbitrary, really.

And saying that I'm biased towards one group or another doesn't really change the argument.

If you're saying that rich and poor aren't treated equally, and that they should be?  I agree with you.

If you are saying that that is impossible, so, eat the rich?  I disagree.  It's no different than saying that the rich should eat you. ",ting_bu_dong,e8iqgzo,SandersForPresident

"Pretty radical centrism at the end there. You’re just abandoning nuance for the sake of ideological purity with that line. 

I don’t really agree with the third or fourth assumption in your list either. People will only oppress other groups if it actually serves their interest to do so. The bourgeoisie have a clear motive for the oppression of the workers; it’s profitable. Worker groups don’t really have as clear a motive to oppress other workers. Generally cooperative work is more productive. 

The fourth point contradicts the first two. If we assume the first two points are true, then how will any government possibly accomplish the fourth without themselves becoming representatives of a clear group? And in a capitalist economy where wealth and ownership offer substantial power and authority, why would it not follow that political power would seek to attach itself to that economic power? Liberal capital democracy will inevitably become a democracy of the bourgeoisie, where what choices the masses are allowed to vote for are only those things which don’t threaten the economic hierarchy. 

I’m not saying the rich and poor should be treated equally. I’m saying we shouldn’t even have rich and poor groups, especially as distinct and distant as they are now. It’s not as though the concept of extreme wealth is a necessary one for a society to be built around. You’re sort of assuming your position to be true as part of your argument for your position.

">On the road, Sanders is obsessive about how many people are following his tour via Facebook and Twitter. Of the staff he’s brought along with him, nearly half are dedicated to video and social media. At every stop, they chase after him with a camera. Everything is filmed and livestreamed and tweeted. As soon as Sanders gets in the van, or on the plane, the first question for his staff is always the same: “So, what are the numbers?”


>He doesn’t just want to know that 3,000 people attended his rally in Bloomington. He wants to see how many likes are on the Facebook post about the rally. He wants to know how many people they are reaching — by the hour. He wants to hear which videos are performing well, and about which issues. His aide will usually show him on a laptop, which Sanders reads by holding the machine in the air, screen close to his face. He is very aware that a Social Security event at a public library in Indiana may draw a crowd of 200 people in the room — but that 200,000 people are following along online.



>Aides estimate that Sanders is reaching 5 to 6 million people per day on this tour.

>For the senator, those numbers are not only a measure of enthusiasm. They are “accomplishments,” he says during an interview between stops in Iowa. “So if you’re gonna ask me about some of my proudest accomplishments in the last two years — we have done three town meetings that I’ve gotten between a million and 2 million viewers. The ability to talk about our issues, directly to people, is extraordinary.”



>He is particularly interested in how his reach compares to traditional news outlets. And is equally concerned as any major publisher, it seems, about changes to Facebook’s algorithm to boost the presence of friend-to-friend exchanges in its News Feed.

">The tour, and every livestream, tweet, and Facebook post from it, show the Sanders political revolution at a new and uncertain inflection point. The Vermont senator, who is also up for reelection in his home state next month, believes he is winning the debate on ideas, but now his job is to convince people to do something about it. The man who built his 2016 campaign on a message about a rigged, oligarchical, and corrupt system spent the weekend telling voters to stop “moaning and groaning” and vote.

>On the subject of the 2020 election, and whether he decides to run again, the most important question on his mind, as he describes it, is what kind of candidate is best positioned to beat Donald Trump. If the answer isn’t Sanders, aides say, he won’t run. (On Twitter, one notes, Sanders sees Trump as his biggest “competitor.”)

>“Jeff and I were just talking about this the other day. I think when you look at the kind of candidate who can beat Trump, you’re probably looking at the battleground states,” he says, citing a recent poll in Florida. “Probably what you’re looking at in terms of beating Trump is what candidate could do well in those battleground states, and that is the ability to speak to working people — whether they’re black or white or Latino.”

>“As I think about this thing, am I thinking about which candidate is the strongest in order to beat Trump? Yes, of course.” Is it the number one question? “I think it is, yes. And we’ve got some great candidates. I know all of them. And they’re really good. But I think the question that all of us are going to have to sit down and determine is—” Sanders pauses. “Trump is — he is a liar. He’s a tough candidate to take on. So we have to go with the best candidate.”

..............................................

>“Look,” he says. “What we can say without fear of hesitation is there are some people, Democrats and Republicans, whose mommies and daddies told them when they were at the country club that they were born to be president. That was not the case. My parents, who are both deceased now, would not believe that I am a United States senator.”

>**“So no, I don’t look in the mirror and say this was the guy who was destined to become president.”**

"Progressives have made in roads within the DNC and at the local party level, which will help contain some of the issues we saw in 2016, where local party leaders ran stuff through without any opposition, well there will be opposition this time around.  

Plus I don’t believe they can create any outcome they want.   They can twist the rules at the caucus to get a few extra delegate votes (which might make a big difference in a close race), but when the result is obvious, they can’t make up for it.  They have their districts where they have more leverage, and others that they can’t do anything shady in.  We’ve reduced their ability to be shady in some places, and most importantly, this time people know Bernie.  

He was an unknown in the early stages of those primaries, and HRCs Southern Fire Wall worked as planned, and she carried that original lead throughout, which really hindered Bernie's campaign.  

Anyway, it’s a whole new ball game this time around, and they will try to stop him, but I am not really that worried about it.  By the time he gets the nomination, the DNC will be falling all over themselves to show how much they are feeling the bern.  ",jonnyredshorts,e8gm1f9,SandersForPresident

The biggest challenge is Biden I think, he will have a ton of money, but his popularity numbers are artificially inflated. More to do with personality than any policy substance.

We need mixed economy. As of now, US is more like socialism for the big money, and capitalism for the small people. So when bank failed, we bailed them out and lots of advantageous tax cuts and benefits to the big company; on the other hand, the middle class people are really screezed, no job security, no affordable health care.

"Sanders *has* directly addressed how his policies would affect income for lower and middle class America, though. You can see a full chart [right here](https://taxfoundation.org/details-and-analysis-senator-bernie-sanders-s-tax-plan/) that lays out Bernie's proposed tax plan and how it affects all income levels. Under Sanders' plan, your rate would have been 17.2%.

Currently, the tax rate for individuals in your position is 15%. You can see that [here](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-brackets.aspx). So yes, your taxes would have gone up 2%. I'm not going to dismiss that—it is indeed an increase. But.

As someone who makes under 20K, you would have absolutely been eligible and benefited from covered health insurance. All the money you would have had to spend on it from your savings would have stayed in your bank account.

""Certainly the most aggressive aspect of Bernienomics is the senator’s plan to collect an additional $1.6 trillion a year in taxes — the equivalent of 7 percent of GDP. Although all households would pay higher taxes, 40 percent of the extra taxes would come from households in the top 1 percent — those with annual incomes above $500,000, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. Those households would see their overall federal tax bite rise from 34 percent to 55 percent.

Sanders argues that it is misleading to look at the tax increase he proposes without also considering the money households would not have to spend on health insurance premiums and co-payments as a result of his plan. A study by the liberal-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice found that 95 percent of American households — those with incomes below $225,000 — would have more money to spend on everything other than taxes and health care.""",Sir_Hapstance,e8gclrb,SandersForPresident

"Well... one incentive to still work hard is that you still make more money. If you make $1,000,000 before taxes, you're still taking home a boatload more cash than you are at $500,000 before taxes.

If you think high taxes for the rich is straight-up theft—and yet still supported Bernie Sanders at one point(?)— then I'm not sure there's much of anything I can say to change your mind. However this quote from Elizabeth Warren sums it up in a way I can't put better, and will always stick with me:

>“I hear all this, you know, ‘Well, this is class warfare,  this is whatever.' No. There is nobody in this country who  got rich on his own. Nobody.  
You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear:  you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for;  you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your  factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us  paid for. You didn’t have to worry that marauding bands would come and  seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against  this, because of the work the rest of us did.  
Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific,  or a great idea? God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the  underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward  for the next kid who comes along.”

P.S. - Do you happen to make $15 per hour or more, by the way? Forgive me if I'm wrong, but based off your annual income it suggests to me that you do not. Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour is a core part of Sanders' platform and again, offsets the burden of taxes on the impoverished.",Sir_Hapstance,e8h3l3y,SandersForPresident
"I'll take your points in order:

1)  Commendable.  But just because you are so 'elightened' doesn't give you any right or responsibility to disregard the points of others based on your interpretation of your privilege.  For those of us who actually worked to get where they are, the idea of privilege as a means to gatekeep is insulting, exclusionary and emblematic of the out of touch nature of the typical sewer dwelling neo-liberal.

2) The DNC doesn't put forth good candidates anymore.  They haven't in a while.  These days we have virtue-signalers (Harris), hypocrites (Booker) and identity politicians (Warren).  The only hope the party had was Bernie... and we see how well they treated him.  An argument can be made for Merekely and Insley, but I doubt much will happen there.  Those two are far too good to be taken seriously by the establishment DNC.  

Subpoint:  voting for my interests does not in any way require me to 'check my privilege'.  Retire this pathetic trope, would you?

3) You are a thoughtless loyalist and tribalist.  Your fury that a Bernie supporter could ever vote GOP is illustrative of this.  Your derision toward someone who doesn't believe exactly as you do further defines your lackluster, benal, and craven attempts to secure your own identity as a leftist.  What's funny to me is that you fail to realize that with every purity test you apply to others, you secure a win for the right. Keep excluding people who could be an ally and you'll do exactly what the DNC did... lose support.

4) You were done talking to me quote a while ago, actually.  A talk implies that information is exchanged.  All you've been doing is grandstanding on a morality soapbox built out of self-importance and delusion.  Perhaps basking in the glory of acknowledging your privilege precludes you from understanding the limitations of your hardcore stance.... Or perhaps you are just too fucking stupid to see that people like you are the reason why Trump is in office.  But keep patting yourself on the back for being what the righties call a cuck.  You've earned that appellation.",Merit_based_only,e8ifs4p,SandersForPresident
"I work extremely part time. I make more than $15. I worked hard and bought an apartment with cash. I continue to save money while being paid ""poverty"" wages because I don't feel as if I'm owed anything and I don't blow my money on avacado toast and Starbucks. People who like Bernie are lazy (was me) and feel entitled to free shit because they don't understand the value of improving their lives. It's an ideological debate at this point. I don't think people working at McDonald's should be paid $15/hour to start. Nor those that work for small/large businesses that don't require skill or risking their health/lives. Our economy would be destroyed if the minimum wage were $15. There would be no incentive to better yourself and a majority of small businesses would not be able to pay those wages while profiting.

How in the world is Warren's heritage is of any relevance to the discussion... if that's what your mind jumps to when someone brings her up in any context, then don't be surprised when the people you're debating with think you've been poisoned by right-wing talking points.

"Disclaimer: not American, so maybe things are different, but...

The whole things seems stupid to be honest. They're comparing apples and oranges.

I'm pretty sure my ""wait times"" were lower when I was uninsured simply because I only sought doctors if I thought I was going to die. Otherwise I avoided health care as much as I could.

Now, I go to doctors way more often. Of course, sometimes I have to wait a few weeks to get an appointment with the doctor I prefer. But that's because I can look them up ahead and pick one that's an expert in whatever I think is wrong with me. If I was calling every doctor in town asking ""please help me I thing I'm going to die"" I could probably get one to see me asap, or just go to a hospital.

In a system where everyone is insured, maybe wait times will be a bit longer, but in a private system everyone who's not rich is waiting for a miracle before going to a doctor... And that doesn't count as ""wait time"".",LiarsEverywhere,e8dkhzi,SandersForPresident

The pharmacist had to call in and get the company to confirm my insurance for me. I don't go to the doctor for anything because it costs too much and anything they tell me I might need done or prescriptions or whatever will just cost more. I suspect I have anxiety issues and/or depression but do I know? lmao no, it costs too much to know. I run now and every time i feel even a slight pain I start to panic. is this it? is this where my legs stop working and I don't know why and I can't get help? My left knee has some slight pain going up the steps after a run lately. Is something wrong? Is it serious? Do I keep going? Do I need to stop for a while? Hell if I know, I can't afford to go find out from a professional, so I'll just wing it, like a couple months ago when I had consistent pain in my right calf that I ""healed"" by trying out 3 different kinds of compression garments and a massage ball because it was cheaper than actually seeing a doctor. Took two months to totally go away. My right knee has had off-and-on weirdness since I was 15 years old, 13 years ago. Never saw a doctor about it. it's just a thing.

"There are 41 million Americans who receive Medicare that are listed as 65 years old and older (so not including people on disability). The total senior population is 46 million. Those numbers are from 2011, when private insurance premiums were lower and Medicare expansion was still being enacted in many states, so most likely even more seniors are on Medicare than before.

It's not like being in a Scandinavian country, Canada, etc where you go to the doctor, he takes care of you, and you leave.  So it's not exactly the same thing as single payer.

"If every other first world country can afford some form of government healthcare I don't see why the richest country in the world can't. Government healthcare is overwhelmingly popular in every country that has it, and the US healthcare system is one of the most unpopular. It's not a secret as to why. Out of every major democratic country, there's only one that allows people to go bankrupt because they were born with a genetic disorder. There's only one that forces people to get two or even three full-time jobs just to pay for their cancer treatments because they can't get good insurance. There's only one that allows corporations to overcharge several hundred dollars for life-saving drugs that only cost $10 to make. There's only one where you pay hundreds for insurance every month and never miss a payment, get cancer, and then have your insurance deny you because you had chicken pox or acne as a kid decades ago.

The complete disaster of a healthcare system we have is not only insanely immoral, but also destroys worker productivity, and costs us a lot of money. This, combined with a myriad of other things, makes medicare-for-all the obvious choice, and the only ones who are opposed are insurance CEOs, the people payed off by them, the poor souls who have bought into the propaganda, and the rich oligarchs who don't want the peasants getting life-saving checkups and surgery before their sprained ankle is dealt with.",Venteran,e8epljd,SandersForPresident
Wait times are already infinitely longer for those who can’t afford to go. To those people even “longer” wait times are better than no wait times. ,Zexks,e8dvlpo,SandersForPresident
"Healthcare is rationed in every country. In the US healthcare is rationed according to how much you can pay. The cost of our lower wait times in this chart is that 20,000 people die every year because they cannot afford healthcare. Even more go bankrupt because of the costs. 

In practical every other advanced country, healthcare is rationed by need. If you have a heart attack? You go to the front of the line. If you have a stroke? Front of the line. If your doctor suspects you have cancer? You're not waiting to see a specialist. The cost of this is that non life-threatening treatments get pushed back. If you need a hip replacement, you may have to wait a bit. It will be inconvenient - it will probably suck, but you will ultimately get the treatment you need. Additionally in many of these countries you can elect to purchase supplemental insurance, where you can buy lower wait times if you can afford it.

I also thing that the chart this whole discussion is around it very misleading. The chart shows a percentage of seniors who had to wait more than 4 weeks for a specialist appointment. 

What it does not show:

-It doesn't show what percentage of those people who had those wait times and life threatening vs non nonthreatening conditions. 

-It specifically mentions that it does not include respondents who never tried to get an appointment. So this chart doesn't include people who avoided seeking medical care due to cost. 

-A range of wait times. It could be that Canada's wait times are commonly more than 4 weeks, but rarely more than that and that America's wait times are consistently at 3 and a half weeks, and rarely less than that. Maybe it's the opposite and seniors in Canada are waiting years for hip replacements. I don't know. The graph doesn't show that information. 

-Also, why 4 weeks? Why that specific marker? Why not 3? 2? Why not 6? or 8? I would suspect that's because they think that is that data that make their data look the best. it would be easy to show the standard deviations for specialist wait times between different countries. I want to see that graph.

It is also funny that this applies to seniors *who are under a single payer system* in the United States.",JuxtaTerrestrial,e8e0vi8,SandersForPresident
"If there is only one payer you would be expanding both the patient pool and the provider pool. Not sure if anyone has done analysis on wait times, but I think the ultimate goal of one payer is to also promote more providers to perform primary care instead of specializing, as increased access to primary care will decrease the need for specialist care as chronic problems are diagnosed sooner and followed much more closely. Obviously, this would take some time for the changes to work through, but is truly the only sustainable model for large-scale healthcare.

"This is exactly the problem.   Seniors and others on medicare/medicaid do OK right now, but only because most doctors severely limit the number of medicare/medicaid patients they will see.  They do this because they lose money on them.   Most take on a few, either out of altruism or perhaps they are required to do so, I don't know.  But basically, they are being subsidized by everyone paying the full rate.  

If everyone was on Medicare, then there would be a massive reduction in doctor income.  This will cause a lot of doctors to get out of the business.

In fact, this is basically how single payer works - you drive prices down until you start having provider scarcity problems.  That's how you know you've squeezed the optimum amount of blood out of the turnip, so to speak.

Personally, I don't have a problem with wait times.

It is easy to pay someone, but isn't easy to afford it. That's the big part of this picture you're ignoring. Speed and quality of care for private insurance means nothing to most seniors who cannot afford it. ",mw19078,e8d6s6v,SandersForPresident
">US hegemony has coincided with the most peaceful times in world history.

And before that British hegemony did, and before that it was the French, and before that the Germans, and before that the Romans, and then the other Romans. It's the most peaceful time in history because every time is always the most peaceful time in history. Averaged out across the globe every century has seen less human in human violence that the last, America had nothing to do with it. ",oodsigma,e8erucv,SandersForPresident

I despise Hillary and Soros. I respect Obama and Biden, but I think the time for their brand of politics is long passed. No matter who the targets are, this kind of action is intolerable. 

I stand by everything I said. These bomb threats were clearly meant to intimidate people who these right wing wackjobs think are on the left. It’s a result of Trump’s rhetoric.

>* We are refueling their planes before they drop those bombs  
>* We are assisting with intelligence  

>An American-made bomb obliterated a school bus full of young boys. American weapons have been used in a string of such deadly attacks on civilians.  

>2015-2018 more than 30% of the Saudi-led coalition’s targets have been nonmilitary.

>Mr. Pompeo had overruled the State Department’s own regional and military experts. President Trump himself echoed this logic when asked about the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, claiming that the Saudis are spending “$110 billion” on military equipment. A former lobbyist for the arms manufacturer Raytheon leads Mr. Pompeo’s legislative affairs staff.  


>The relationship between Iran and the Houthis has only strengthened with the intensification of the war. The war is creating the very problem the administration claims to want to solve. The conflict between Saudi-led forces and the Houthi insurgents had helped Al Qaeda and the Islamic State’s Yemen branch “deepen their inroads across much of the country.”
