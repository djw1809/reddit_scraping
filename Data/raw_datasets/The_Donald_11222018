"The Supreme court role is to determine the constitutionality of: 

\#Any Law Congress passes;

\#Executive decisions and Orders;

\#Cases brought before them from the lower courts;

\#Jurisdiction over the Lower Courts  

without bias and Political affiliation.

Political commentary is not specifically addressed nor does the Code of Conduct apply to it:

 

The debate over recent remarks by a Supreme Court Justice about a  presidential candidate has brought attention to a little-understood part  of the judicial system, the Code of Conduct for Federal Judges.

üì∑The [code is published and updated](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/code-conduct-united-states-judges)  by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the national  policy-making office of the federal court system. The Chief Justice of  the United States, John G. Roberts, Jr., presides over the conference.  Its members include the chief judges of every federal circuit court, and  other federal judges.

The conference worked with the American Bar  Association on the code and it adopted the current Code of Conduct in  1973 when it was proposed by Chief Justice Warren Burger. The code has  been revised eight times since 1973.

The full federal code applies  to ‚ÄúUnited States circuit judges, district judges, Court of  International Trade judges, Court of Federal Claims judges, bankruptcy  judges, and magistrate judges.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt apply to the Justices of the  Supreme Court. (States have their own codes based on ABA guidelines.)

The  federal code also provides advisory guidance using ‚Äúethical canons‚Äù for  judges to whom the code applies. ‚ÄúThe Code of Conduct provides guidance  for judges on issues of judicial integrity and independence, judicial  diligence and impartiality, permissible extra-judicial activities, and  the avoidance of impropriety or even its appearance,‚Äù the conference  says.

Supreme Court Justices aren‚Äôt required to observe the code. According to the Constitution, ¬†they serve as long as they exhibit ‚Äú[good behavior](http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/articles/article-iii),‚Äù or face [possible impeachment](http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/articles/article-ii#section-4) and removal for ‚Äútreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""",NoKing1314,ea8tp6j,The_Donald

I just don‚Äôt see the dying in office argument as a valid one at all. As far as dictatorships go, as someone posted above, there is checks and balances in the US to help prevent that.

"True story.  The Muslims the crusades fought against are nearly identical to the Muslims today. The same thing great leaders in the past criticized Islam about is just as applicable today as it was then.

>**How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy.** The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity.


>**The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property‚Äîeither as a child, a wife, or a concubine‚Äîmust delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.** Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen: all know how to die. But the influence of the religion paralyzes the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science‚Äîthe science against which it had vainly struggled‚Äîthe civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.

No point in continuing this. You‚Äôve decided to behave like a troll. If you‚Äôd like some place to start educating yourself about tolerance though, start at Romans 14 in your own good book. I‚Äôve read the Bible. Many times. It‚Äôs a large part of why I can‚Äôt believe a bit of it. It‚Äôs got good advice though. 

‚ÄîAccept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters. 2 One person‚Äôs faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. 3 The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them. 4 Who are you to judge someone else‚Äôs servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.

You'd use that to create an outline of connections that you can make look like they are nefarious (think shit like 'Russian mafia' buying Trump condos). These are innocuous things, most people cross paths with criminals, or people connected to them. Most of us have someone in our family who is on the wrong side of the law.

Then you'd start to put assets in place in order to create a misleading narrative. You'd get a warrant (FISA or otherwise), monitor them, and collect the manufactured evidence that fits with the narrative you've planned. 

So imagine if Trump had sent an email to someone on July 20th, 2016 saying ""I got your package, it was wonderful!"" Package being a gift basket or something innocuous. Then you'd get a FISA on someone remotely connected to Trump, have an asset contact them and say ""Yeah, Trump got a package of Hillary's emails on July 20th"". And suddenly you have enough evidence to search Trump's email, find the message that 'proves' he got a package, and it bolsters your case.

Just think if you had every communication a person had made. You'd easily be able to find vague Nostradamus type messages that are sent to people who have ties you can exploit.",bsbbtnh,ea8rh4e,The_Donald

"Cliffy B, NPC. Last relevant over a decade ago.

He was all for testosterone-fuelled, hyper-macho, dude-bro jock action when that was the prevailing trend, and they sold millions of games as a result.

He was such a socialist to the point he would brag about his Ferrari collection in interviews. He was such a feminist that he made an analogy with women and games to disparage demos, saying you wouldn't want to date a girl you'd fucked on the first date, because why waste your time now you've had your fun already and got bragging rights?

Now the political climate's changed, this low-IQ idiot's entire belief system automatically installed the system update, and he's making soy-infused games and political statements that nobody cares about, because the man has no thoughts other than what pop culture tells him to have. 

He's basically the Zoolander of game dev. A colossal narcissist and completely fucking vacant. I don't think I've read a single statement by him in either his jock or soy phases that didn't make me facepalm at the sheer arrogance and stupidity of the man. He has no self-awareness at all.

Gears of War was never anything more than a celebration of militarism. He even said in interviews at the time that it was meant to be a celebration of WW2 vets and the Greatest Generation's sacrifice. It wasn't an attack on the military-industrial complex, but the opposite. It was a tribute to the determination of total war.

Are those sufficient credentials?

"because they want, for their globalist reasons to topple the current king of saudi arabia just like they toppled sadam. kashoggi was an arabian elite which for some reasons got in conflict with the king of saudi arabia. check out his family history from wikipedia out of all sources.

>Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi was born in Medina on 13 October 1958.\[2\]\[6\]\[14\] His grandfather, Muhammad Khashoggi, who was of Turkish origin (n√© Muhammed Halit Ka≈üƒ±k√ßƒ±), married a Saudi Arabian woman and was personal physician to King Abdulaziz Al Saud, the founder of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\[15\]  
>  
>Jamal Khashoggi was the nephew of the high-profile Saudi Arabian arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, known for his part in the Iran‚ÄìContra scandal,\[16\]\[17\] who was estimated to have had a net worth of US$4 billion in the early 1980s.\[18\]\[19\] Adnan Khashoggi had claimed that his own grandfather was of Jewish descent.\[20\] Khashoggi was the first cousin of Dodi Fayed, who was dating Diana, Princess of Wales, when the two were killed in a car crash in Paris.\[21\]  
>  
>He received his elementary and secondary education in Saudi Arabia and obtained a bachelor's degree in business administration from Indiana State University in the United States in 1982.\[6\]\[22\]\[23\]

His mother was a personal physician to the founder of SA and his uncle was the leading arms dealer in the country. Yeh Kashogi definetly was just a ""journalist.""

Kashoggi is just another excuse they are using to ramp up another regime change in the middle east. Same playbook used many times in the past. Nothing different now. remember Sadam's wmd or the fact that somehow he was trying to kill Bush'es father? The globalist elite are preparing for either war or regime change.

And that is if you believe the official story. If you analyze the facts a bit closer u start to wonder why on Earth was someone who allegedly had a death wish put on him by the king of saudi arabia leaving the security of the USA and going to Turkey out of all countries to get a visa at the saudi embassy there.

Also, those same savages and those living in your country, constantly shit on Caucasians and tell them to not reproduce because they are the bane of humanity. They're also the ones trying to promote the importation of Muslims, blacks, and other welfare dependents (which single mothers are a big part of).

It looks different mostly because America is a multiracial, mass immigration society where a large part of the people are unable to pay into the system. So the healthcare system becomes a wealth transfer mechanism. That's not true in say Denmark where 90% of the people are in the middle class(it's more like an insurance).

I know abortion is immoral. But our whole society is immoral. I understand the argument that it's a human being having its life taken away, and it's a choice to have sex.

But hey... If Republicans are against abortion, then let them make babies. Let the liberals abort their children. How do you think middle eastern people will take over Europe? By out breeding the natives. Not by force. They'll eventually become the majority, and will assume positions of power, and change the nation all together. 

What I tell my liberal family members (who I love to death) is ""if you want gun control, then I will work for abortion control. Leave our guns alone, and I'll leave your abortions alone"".

I know alot of you will disagree with this and that's fine!  I still like to think of myself as a far right nationalist.

That number will not increase it will go down for a time.

There's a race between France and Sweden to see who can get islamized first. +You do have to consider that the muslims will then sperg out illegalize homosexuality and drive women out of public life. That combined with the collapse of the social safety net will change everything (for example many migrants will leave if the welfare payments dry up).

TLDR, US is now largest producer of crude oil on the planet. Talks with Saudi Arabia include asking SA to not constrict their oil production.

The lower price of oil thanks to the large supply is also likely to be intended at crippling Russia and Iran as well, both of which rely on exports of oil for their income.

">  Imagine believing this.  

He doesn't.  There's a fifth column at work and there always has been.  The electoral success of a mix of conservatism, populism, libertarianism, and nationalism has caused the globalists to call in almost every asset that they have.  That is why you see supposed Republicans who were demonized by the liberal media suddenly turning their coats.  That is why every time you see a majority of normal thinking people anywhere, suddenly *just enough* of them turn over to make stuff possible for the other side.  

The middle of the article skips over this, but the end of the article alludes to it.  My take is that Roberts has been tapped by his masters again, and soon he'll follow the long tradition of Republican-appointed justices that turn into ""swing"" justices for whatever hot-button issue the globalists need done.

See, everything ALWAYS goes to shit.  Be it nations, morals, even the entire universe.  Entropy is coming to kill everything.  Indeed, when the Bible talks about ""Death"" entering the world from sin, I think God was talking about Entropy, but not willing to waste 3/4 of the people he was talking to's lives explaining how the universe works.  So what does he do?

He repeatedly buys time.  Over and over again, from Eden to Revelation, we hear about things that were good going bad because people are horrible.  And you can see it around you, too.  If I go back to the neighborhoods I grew up in, they're dirtier, crappier, there's more crime, and more leftists.  It happened to Israel over and over and over.

But occasionally there were good Kings, or Judges.  Side note, how great is the book of Judges?  Well, this gentleman, and his brothers in arms, and their allies from the other free-ish nations, they were Samson for the entire world.  The Philistines (Germany and Japan) were out to conquer everything, and then Germany would have turned on Japan and nuked them into oblivion, let's be honest.  So God gave us a global Samson, only their ""Asses Jawbone"" was modern weaponry, and they set things right, for a time.

All we're seeing right now is our Samson (America) stupidly getting drunk and telling the enemy how to cut off our hair.

It is not sudden, unexplainable cowardice and ""wanting to fit in"" - aka peer pressure? Are we talking about the US government or a 1980s high school?? - that causes lifelong conservatives to suddenly lose every principle when they go to work in Washington, DC. 

It is **blackmail rings** that are making them do those things. And the sooner we all realize this, the better. This is fundamental to how the Deep State works. It is not even an issue of whether the blackmail is happening, all you have to do is look at otherwise unexplainable phenomena like the sudden 180 degrees change in Lindsey Graham, to realize what is happening. The question we really need to be asking is, who are the people/entities/nations actually behind it and what can we do to stop it.

"They were looking for ways to heat up the earth in the 1970s, they thought we were about to hit a new ice age.


**1972 National Science Board report:**

""Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end, to be followed by a long period of considerably colder temperatures leading to the next glacial age some 20,000 years from now. However, it is possible, or even likely, that human interference has already altered the environment so much that the climatic pattern of the near future will follow a different path.

For instance, widespread deforestation in recent centuries, especially in Europe and North America, together with increased atmospheric opacity due to man-made dust storms and industrial wastes, should have increased the Earth‚Äôs reflectivity. At the same time increasing concentration of industrial carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should lead to a temperature increase by absorption of infrared radiation from the Earth‚Äôs surface.

When these human factors are added to such other natural factors as volcanic eruptions, changes in solar activity, and resonances within the hydro-atmosphere, their effect can only be estimated in terms of direction, not of amount""",mysql101,ea7bo74,The_Donald

"Global warming is real, and does cause colder winters. That's why they changed the name to climate change, because as each winter gets colder and colder everyone always says ""so much for that global warming"". Here's  a simple experiment you can do at home:

1) fill a glass with ice.




2) fill a glass with warm water and get the temperature of the water.




3) melt the ice in the first glass with a hairdryer. Note the temperature of the water that came from the ice.




4) pour the cold water from the ice glass into the glass with the warm water.




5) note the new temperature in the first glass.





Ok, what did you just do?





Your glass of ice was basically polar ice.
Your glass of warm water was the ocean.
Your hairdryer was the warm atmosphere (global warming).

By melting the ice with your hairdryer, you simulated the melting of polar ice. By dumping the melted ice water into the warm water, you simulated the polar ice melting and flowing into the ocean, lowering the temperature of the ocean water.

But wait, how does that make winter colder? Ahh, you see there's things called jetstreams and air currents that blow air all over the world. Because the biggest surface of the world is ocean, most of this air is being blown across the water (which is now cooler) and then eventually this air makes landfall, colder than it would normally be.  Boom, now you have colder winters thanks to ""global warming"". To take your kitchen science experiment further, hold your hand on the other side of each glass and blow air from your mouth across the top of each water surface. Note the vast difference in air temperature.

Guys, global warming is real. All it takes is a thermometer to verify this, those aren't exactly sophisticated pieces of equipment.

**Where I differ from liberals is the cause of global warming. They think it's man made and want to profit off it and extort people, but I think it's a natural cycle. I think we are in a warming cycle right now which will ultimately end soon with a new ice age. If you look at the natural heating and cooling cycles of the Earth, we are long overdue for another ice age. Any way the point is denying global warming is stupid it's not going to get us anywhere. We'll regret it when we aren't prepared for 120 degree sumners in NY in 30 years and Florida under water in 100 years. But at the same time we need to call out liberals and expose their lies that global warming is created by man. Give me a break, mankind aren't that powerful.

Just to be brief, if hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 are locked up under the surface for hundreds of millions of years, life on the surface adapts to such, lower, Levels of CO2.  If humans come along and directly release hundreds of billions of tons into the atmosphere in a few centuries I dont think it's too crazy to come to the conclusion that global climate variables will shift as a result.  Its total not nonsense.  CO2 *is* a green house gas.  Humans *are* releasing waaaaay more than would have otherwise ended up in the atmosphere.  I think where things get sticky is when people call for regulation that will destroy thousands upon thousands of jobs while not really doing anything to curtail global carbon emissions.

No one can come to a consensus as to whether water vapor has a net positive or negative effect on the greenhouse effect.  Yes, water vapor traps heat, but water vapor ultimately seeds clouds which increase the albedo.  What we were taught was that water vapor had a net cooling effect and that as the cloud fraction increased to 1.0, then and only then could the water vapor start to drive temperatures up since the albedo would remain unchanged (it would already be maximized).",bpsk31,ea79nzg,The_Donald

1960's - there had been 30 YEARS OF COOLING - they thought we'd hit a new ice age. 70 scientists went to the poles in planes and ships to do research.          
Then in the space of a few years temperatures started rising again. It WASN'T a ""fringe element"" - a search on research papers back in the day shows more contained cooling information than warming...

This documentary is far from an objective, critical examination of climate science. Instead the Great Global Warming Swindle goes to great lengths to present outdated, incorrect or ambiguous data in such a way as to grossly distort the true understanding of climate change science, and to support a set of extremely controversial views. ""

&#x200B;

Along with that, some of the graphs and claims presented in the film were based on fabricated and incorrect data. Again, taken directly from the Wikipedia article:

> ""We have concerns regarding the use of a graph featured in the documentary titled 'Temp & Solar Activity 400 Years'. Firstly, we have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that were presented as genuine. The inclusion of the artificial data is both misleading and pointless. Secondly, although the narrator commentary during the presentation of the graph is consistent with the conclusions of the paper from which the figure originates, it incorrectly rules out a contribution by anthropogenic greenhouse gases to 20th century global warming.""

&#x200B;

>"" A second issue was the claim that human emissions of CO2 are small compared to natural emissions from volcanoes. This is untrue: current annual emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement production are estimated to be around 100 times greater than average annual volcanic emissions of CO2. That large volcanoes cannot significantly perturb the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere is apparent from the ice core and atmospheric record of CO2 concentrations, which shows a steady rise during the industrial period, with no unusual changes after large eruptions. ""

Although the creator of the film claims that these changes don't affect the point the film is trying to make, these should be taken into consideration when deciding the credibility of the film.

"The thing that is always getting ignored is that we have been in a period of high solar activity for quite a while, and average temperatures are up on planets all across the solar system.  Over the past twenty years, we've recorded temperatures increasing, storms getting more active on Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, and Venus, and the ice caps on Mars are also shrinking.  More energetic solar winds are also partially responsible for increased cyclone activity on Earth.

Even our position in the galaxy is a factor, as we have entered a lower density area of the local interstellar cloud, so more primary cosmic rays are entering the solar system and impacting Earth's atmosphere.

We have no control at all over so many major factors that cause our climate to change... and it's always changing.  It was changing long before humans crawled out of the soup, and it'll be changing long after we are nuclear shadows burned onto the pavement.",Meddlesom,ea895cm,The_Donald

China is hungry for everything, from raw materials to land. China is hungry as hell for oil. They can't get enough of the stuff.   Half of the reason why they allow ghost cities in China is because that's still a ton of resources they can recycle for the future.

China doesn't even produce all of its own food, it literally doesn't have enough land that's farmable to feed 100% of their population. So China has to either obtain more land, or be forever reliant upon foreign countries to fill all their food needs. This is one reason that makes it difficult for China to get in a long drawn out war.

The bottom fell out once it started being revealed that scientists were fudging data to make their models seem accurate (models rather than ongoing prospective studies).  Even NASA was found to be fudging data regarding temperature readings.  The IPCC was outed for bias in writing the parameters that could be included in studying climate change so that the research would ""prove"" that climate change was caused by man's carelessness (anthropogenic global warming) rather than any possible natural phenomena.  Of note is that the IPCC would not allow studies to include any information whatsoever into the climate effects of solar activity, even though many scientists had been reporting for years about the periodic warming and cooling related to solar cycles.

If you average out the emission looks smaller than the human CO2 emission, which also implies that one single eruption emit so much CO2 over the short period.

This is a problem that becomes worse the more we wait. There are climate feedback loops. Once we surpass a certain amount of warming, these feedback loops will kick into gear. Ice sheets will collapse irreversibly (on the scale of thousands of years. That will lower Earth's reflectivity, causing more rise in temperature.

If we don't keep the temperature from rising now, we will experience several an additional rise in temp of several degrees Celsius.

"I'm sorry, but this is 100% not true. The northern polar ice cap is still there. [Here is NASA's own report that talks about it](https://neptune.gsfc.nasa.gov/csb/index.php?section=234), showing they are concerned about the rate of ice melt on the Northern caps, which is faster now on avg than it has been previously (since they have been tracking from 1978 til now), but I quote NASA's own page, from their 1st Nov, 2018 report, in reference to comparing the Antarctic ice growth vs the south:

> ""In contrast, in the Antarctic the sea ice coverage has been increasing although at a lesser rate than the decreases in the Arctic""

In other words, Antarctic ice is not melting on avg each year, it is actually still increasing, and it is increasing at a rate right now higher than any other 10 year trend since they have tracked in 1978. They still mention there seems to be a net loss of ice since the ice gains in the antarctic do not seem to match the ice losses in the north, but I am merely pointing out how you just made this statement, that there is no polar ice in the north anymore, which is false, and the antarctic ice sheets are melting at an unprecedented rate, which is also false.

"Islam is the REAL war on women: 

* Men are in charge of women. Koran 4:34
* Men decide how women dress. Koran 33:59
* Women can be beaten. Tabari IX:113
* Women are stupid. Sahih Bukhari 6:301, Sahih al-Bukhari 2658
* Women are beneath men. Koran 2:228 
* Women comprise the majority of occupants in Muslim ""hell."" Sahih Bukhari 2:18:161, 7:62:125, 54:464; Sahih Muslim 36: 6600

Under Sharia:

* Wives can be beaten. Koran 4:34, Ishaq 969, Muslim 4:2127, Abu Dawud 2141 and 2142
* Wives have to stop what they're doing whenever their husbands demand sex, and give it to them. Jami at-Tirmidhi 1160
* Wives cannot refuse sex. Sunan Ibn Majah 1853
* Raping your wife is allowed. Koran 2:223
* Wives can be raped in any position. Sunan Abu Dawud 2159
* Wives should stay in abusive marriages. Bukhari 72:715
* The most important thing a woman brings to marriage is unrestricted access to her vagina. Sahih Bukhari 62:81 

The Koran devotes MORE verses to making sure that Muslim men know they can keep women as rape slaves (four) than it does to telling them to pray five times a day (zero).

An imam in South Carolina stated that [a husband is the ""owner"" and ""ruler"" of a wife who must obey him as his ""prisoner.""](http://archive.is/wQwW4) 

Eleven of the 12 countries with the [highest rate of discrimination against women are Muslim-majority countries.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NXtIUv5i2w)

Slavery is allowed in Islam and practiced today wherever Muslims live but particularly in Saudi Arabia, Mauritania, and the Sudan. Cleric Abu Ishaq al-Huwaini has [called for a return of slave markets, where **Muslim men can buy rape slaves.**](http://archive.is/VKpj3) In this man's ideal world: ""When I want a sex-slave, I go to the market and pick whichever female I desire and buy her.""

"What conservatives need to understand when they criticize Sharia is that it is NOT simply a religious code of conduct. It is an entire system of government.

That means it does not belong in the same category as these:

* Rabbinical Jewish law
* Catholic church canon
* Eightfold path of Buddhism
* Ethics 

It needs to be compared and contrasted with these:

* Feudalism
* Democracy
* Monarchy
* Old Testament Theocratic Jewish Law
* Constitutional Republic
* Socialism
* Anarchism

That is because Sharia goes WAY beyond just telling Muslims how to live a good life that honors their god. It is an entire system of government with judicial courts, penalties for crimes, marriage laws, slavery, and economics.

It is 100% incompatible with America's representative constitutional republican form of government. If a group of Tibetan immigrants showed up on our doorstep and said ""we want to stake a claim on a plot of land, declare our own sovereignty, and declare the Dalai Lama our king"" it would not be racist to politely tell them to fuck off.

So they can kill each other or attack Russia/China? Islam considers all non-Muslims as valid targets for war. If Russia/China is stupid enough to give them weapons then they will find themselves at war with Islam. 

>Do you want them hating America and allying themselves with Iran?

They already do and killed 3,000 Americans already not counting the losses from the wars that followed.

>Do you realize that would put our troops in Iraq in incredible peril and probably eventually lead to Iraq being another extremist state?

Over 100 bombs were detonated in a single European city in just 10 hours. They should be in Europe not Iraq as an Islamic takeover of Iraq is inevitable. If you look at what we're doing in Syria, we're practically rooting for an Islamic takeover by helping ""moderate"" rebels against Assad. Just want until Syria becomes an Islamic country and soon after Saudi Arabia starts something in Iraq that will force US to back ""moderate"" rebels for another Islamic takeover.

The lesson at the end is that being a good person gets you nothing/you must sacrifice yourself at the end for the greater good. It's all so yawn-inducing at this point and I stopped reading his books a while ago. I did read Dr. Sleep, only because someone gave it to me. It was mediocre like the latest 10 books of his I read. And then I threw it in the recycle bin.

The guy's a washed up old has-been and he was such a dick about that guy who hit him. He was driving down the road, his dog jumped into the front seat, he took his eyes off the road and he hit Stephen King. Accident. Unfortunate. King said the guy had the IQ of a tomato soup can. Cause King is oh so smart and we know that cause he's oh so rich. Typical elitist wealthy Democrat. It's just by the grace of God that this asshole didn't accidentally hurt or kill someone himself when he was drunk and high constantly for years.

"Eh. I give him a pass. He's a prominent writer of the horror genre and one thing that *really* creeps people out is pedophilia and harming children. 

Also, as an English major and avid reader, the scene in IT was hardly about the actual sex taking place, but rather the thematic symbolism of the children unifying in losing their innocents to defeat IT. IT is about an intergalactic shapeshifter who feeds off of fear and brutality, and the scene everyone talks about is speaking directly to the fear that adolescent kids have tied up into sex. 

I fucking hate when people automatically jump to that one part of a 1500 page novel and suddenly start making crass accusations against King when there has never been a incling of proof that he is a pedophile. If anything, he was a bad drug addict with a loving family that pulled him away from his drug and alcohol abuse.

I don't think King is a great writer (I don't think he's terrible, either; he creates great narrative spookiness and is firmly middlebrow/lowbrow, and that's fine).

"You could also use Thanksgiving as a lesson on how the pilgrims discovered socialism didn't work and watch the liberal heads explode. True story.    

Thanksgiving was the festival of abundance because the governor of the colony, William Bradford had previously radically changed land ownership of the colony. Initially, land was held in common, and those who were able bodied worked the land.   Soon the number of takers dramatically outweighed the number of doers, and the colony experienced an ""Atlas Shrugged"" kind of moment. The crops were poorly attended to, starvation and sickness was common.    

Bradford radically decided that their blissful ideal of a communal togethership needed serious revamping. So he allotted each of the colonists land, that they could do as they see fit. It was theirs. They owned it.    

Now each colonists had a personal stake in his own survival.  And they did survive.    

They thrived.     

They built abundance.    And the Thanksgiving harvest was a celebration of the amazing bounty they had created-- when only the year before, they were starving.

"There are some tough realities about working outside the US on orders from the US government/military, and I don't think it would be reasonable (or Constitutional) to make it impossible for many of these people to vote.  ""Mail"" is obviously not a good method, when it would require going through other countries' mail systems.  But absentee ballots should be safe going through secure diplomatic and military ""mail"" channels (the channels used for sending highly classified materials.  Covert CIA operatives, for example, can't be trekking to the nearest US embassy on Election Day (or ever), and yet they're often putting their lives at risk, and always making huge personal sacrifices, to do the work they do, so they can't be deprived of the right to vote.  

But it really shouldn't be impossibly difficult to have a secure absentee balloting system for the relatively small number of US government and military personnel serving overseas.  Their names, ages, locations, and still-alive status are already being documented on an ongoing basis, since they're getting paid and receiving orders.  There should be a central collection office which receives the ballots at least a week or so before Election Day, checks them against the records of authorized absentee voters, and forwards them to the correct state offices (no local precincts involved!), after making a publicly available record of the names and registered precincts of voters whose ballots were submitted to each state.

For large numbers of these special-status voters in one location (e.g. at an embassy or permanent military base), an in-person voting method should be workable (though pretty complicated, since people at one location would need to get many different ballots depending on where they're registered to vote).  It's easy to say ""set up a voting booth on the base"", but actually doing that involves matching the right ballots from many different localities with different slates of candidates for local and state offices, and would essentially boil down to a secure vote-by-mail system.",Periscopia,ea8qwvd,The_Donald

"> **U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts offered rare public criticism of the President of the United States on Wednesday when he pushed back against President Trump‚Äôs claim Tuesday that an ‚ÄúObama judge‚Äù had blocked his effort to deny asylum to those entering the country illegally.**

> **Likewise, Roberts said nothing when Obama bullied the Supreme Court on numerous occasions ‚Äî and even appeared to yield to Obama‚Äôs pressure.**

> **In 2010, President Obama used his first State of the Union address to denounce the Court‚Äôs January 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case, which struck down restrictions on corporate political speech under the First Amendment.**

> **With six of the nine justices sitting silently in the House of Representatives, Obama told  the nation their ruling ‚Äúwill open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.‚Äù**

"According to the stories I've read so far, the FISA court rejected applications they deemed inadequately supported.  The critical applications passed *because they contained false statements.*  

Of course, the situation would be cleared up if we could read the unreacted FISA applications.  In a case such as this, where the integrity of the process has been undermined, continued secrecy suggests misconduct.

I get that Roberts would like to believe that the Federal judges, as a whole, are determinedly politically neutral.  This is the ideal, and it is considered to be vitally important to the judiciary, generally.

However, the 9th Circuit is populated by several judges who have recently written indefensible rulings, apparently for short-term political gain.  These rulings have been reversed, in what passes for short order, by the Supreme Court.  Nonetheless, the FISA Court and the 9th Circuit, for whatever reasons, are out of control, and it is good stewardship on the part of the President to address the problem.

Foreskin circumcision is best done at birth as much less painfull, causes less issues than if done as an adult. Also done mainly for hygienic practices and religious of course. However, it does not affect a man's ability to enjoy sex, far from it.   

Now I can't compare myself before and after cause no way to. But I have discussed this before with many men and women. The input I got was circumcised men, lasted longer, we're more attentive to the women's needs and not his own, and some women had bad hygiene experiences as well.

It's about hygiene more than anything, and never stopped me from jerking. Every girl I had ever been with loved I was circumcised. I lasted longer, which they loved, and no hygiene issues.

In the end, fgm is about supression of a women's ability to enjoy sex.  Only twisted people would not care about this or wanting their partner not to enjoy God's gift to us.

In doing so, you are encouraging the eternal damnation of one of God's children. 

Your comment *could* be what stops a dialog between an atheist and a believer. That *could* have provided me an opportunity to plant seeds. You could have just gone about your day, but no, you'd rather stop an atheist and a Christian from discussing their beliefs.

Next time you have some inane comment where you want to assume a simplistic view of someone's atheist beliefs, just keep your mouth shut. You are an impediment to a potentially reasonable conversation.

>One of the ways capitalism works ""pretty well,"" Mueller and I and a few other loony pro-capitalists such as Michael Novak and James Q. Wilson and Hernando De Soto and the late Robert Nozick claim, is to nourish the virtues. Mueller argues for one direction of causation: ""Virtue is, on balance and all other things being equal, essentially smart business under capitalism: nice guys, in fact, tend to finish first."" Max Weber had a century earlier written to the same effect: ""Along with clarity of vision and ability to act, it is only by virtue [note the word] of very definite and highly developed ethical qualities that it has been possible for [an entrepreneur of this new type] to command the indispensable confidence of his customers and workmen.""

"As someone who has been there and is approaching retirement let me encourage you:

Be happy- you have a job and I promise you putting in hours in times like this won‚Äôt go unnoticed ‚Äî and if it does your work ethic will be appreciated at a better next employer.

There have been many periods in this countries history where jobs were very hard to come by, no matter your work ethic.  And fortunately we are in a period where that‚Äôs not the case. 

That‚Äôs something to be thankful of.

And while my career has taught me that ultimately the best thing is to be self employed, you can‚Äôt start out that way, sucky Jobs are called ‚Äúpaying dues‚Äù but they really are huge learning experiences.  

Yes, you may only see the suck now, but that‚Äôs because  experience is only visible in hindsight.

And the experience you can get paying your dues these days is so much better.  Plus the internet has every subject you could ever want to learn about.  I really did spend hundreds hours every year going to libraries trying to find knowledge to teach myself when I was paying my dues.  I wanted to learn a programming language- had to find the library that had a book on it (it was obscure) plus a hundred other things. Now I can watch a 14 year old Estonian kid on YouTube teach it to me!

Another thing to be thankful of is that it‚Äôs so much easier to start a business and be self employed. You can outsource so much to software these days.

One if my suck jobs was being a copy boy‚Äî literally just photocopying things to be sent around. Email eliminated that job but means you don‚Äôt need a copy department to start your business (along with a million other things.)

So the future has never been brighter.

Oh- and while I do work for myself‚Äî I‚Äôll be working this thanksgiving too.

My boss is an asshole!  ;-)

"True ""Independence"" does not mean giving deference to any particular political ideology or prior rulings of a lower court - it would be making decisions/rulings based solely on your own interpretation of the statutory laws as they are written, and specific arguments of each side arguing how/why the specific issue being heard at the time is or is not within the plain meaning of the established laws.  We will never have that, sadly.

They have done this to great effect with environmental laws as I understand.  Cronies in the  EPA/Interior/USDA will pass some rule.  For arguments sake lets say maybe it's a rule that opens CA forests to thinning operations within a certain distance of massive residential areas.  The administrative rule was put in place so that it could be challenged by big-enviro lawyers and the government can put up a token fight.  A judge demands all such operations cease until a more comprehensive impact review can be performed as to the effect of such clearing on the endangered snails that reside in decaying trees piling up in the woods close to occupied areas.  Those studies justify grants to crony university professors.  The injunction in effect turns an administrative rule into law.,phyllapine,ea759uc,The_Donald

i love all of scalia's other rulings. but he failed miserably with illegals. i hope gorsuch doesn't go down that path. the rulings he has made and will made deal with LEGAL aliens so it is a little different than illegals. i'll keep an open mind on gorsuch. but i'm still livid about that april ruling he did.",fastmandan,ea7t5x8,The_Donald

""Domestic espionage sharing controversy of Five Eyes

****In recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive domestic regulations on spying****. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of the advocacy group Liberty, claimed that the ****FVEY alliance increases the ability of member states to ""subcontract their dirty work"" to each other.The former NSA contractor *Edward Snowden described the FVEY as a ""supra-national intelligence organisation that doesn't answer to the laws of its own countries""****

Trying to blame other countries for a American initiated and Obama,Clapper and Brennan ordered/authorized spying operation is exactly what they want.Five Eyes gives them all the authorization and deniability they need,the Five Eyes members are obligated to fulfill the requests from other members and particularly American which is the biggest member with the most Intelligence assets dedicated to it.

I am not a Republican. I am a centrist with no solid party affiliation. 




However, as the Tolerant Left‚Ñ¢ drags ""The Conversation‚Ñ¢"" further and further to the Far Left Insanity Zone, they are making me look like a Republican (and therefore, Tolerant Leftists‚Ñ¢ identify me as a Republican because I don't join in actively supporting the Leftist Agenda propaganda bandwagon.) 




Leftists do not have an awareness of the ""grey area,"" therefore they do not understand the difference between ""Trump Supporter"" and ""Republican."" 




Useless Paul Ryan is a failed Republican vice-presidential candidate, you don't get any more Officially Republican than that (unless you want to count Mittens, his failed Republican presidential running-mate.) Officially, John McCain was a Republican (although he was on the same Soros take the Leftist politicians benefit from, and ran a Clinton Foundation-style money-grabbing scheme.) There are many others similar to these conspicuous examples who identify as Republican, but could never be mistaken for a Trump Supporter.   




tl;dr I am not a Republican.

You can thank Kamala Harris for the insane requirement for micro-stamping on new guns, which doesn't exist. The safety argument is also a crock of shit, as apparently any handgun is perfectly safe to let our police officers carry. Just not us stupid peasants.",LostViking85,ea7fxop,The_Donald

America is pissed off at these coastal elites to an extent they really don't understand. They can scream and yell and call us all racist hillbillies all they want, but they really have no idea that there is a MASSIVE cultural rift in this country that hasn't been seen in our lifetime.

One part of this country is for law and order, equality under the law, and civil rights. The other is for corruption, racism, genocide, and degeneracy.

The vast swathes of this country which the Left pays no attention to keep the traditions of this country strong. The cities are filled with foreigners and criminals. All good Americans are fleeing the cities as soon as they can to raise children, own property, and have a chance at a good, simple life. In a decade all that will remain are the godless degenerates who worship their own power and the unknowing slaves who serve them.

Things like gab are great ideas. The problem is, until everyone has a gab account the same way they have twitter/facebook/instagram/etc, it's not as useful a platform. Sharing ideas among like-minded people or among people that specifically know to seek it out -- ultimately, does not contain even remotely the same power as casting ideas into the void that get picked up and amplified.

This is why all the facts and data in the world, showing that arming more citizens will save more lives, will never persuade the leaders of the Left. And as for the Leftist peons themselves, they obviously don't realize this, but for them it's still taken as essentially a dogma or axiom.

"First off we have [Jeffrey Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein), who was close friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton. Jeffrey owned a private island, and often invited rich friends, including the Clintons and Kevin Spacey over to is island. What makes this guy notable is that his private Boeing 727 was nicknamed the ""Lolita Express"" and he was trafficking minors. So, this is essentially Pizzegate before Pizzagate, and this guy was caught. Keep in mind that Kevin Spacey is also an outted pedophile, so we essentially had a running pedophile ring.

Which leads us to Pizzagate. During the 2016 elections, Hillary Clinton's private email server was breached. You know, the same server that she was using to [bypass public records and caused the Clintongate candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy). Several of the emails found show several of her compatriots,[specifically one John Podesta, using Pedophilic terminology. Now, Pizzagate is just a conspiracy theory (for now...), but the fact that the Clinton's have associated with pedophiles before is certainly chilling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_xfhpNni0g)

And speaking about pedophiles and the Clintons, let's mention Huma Abedin. There's rumors of an affair between the two while Huma worked for the Clinton Campaign, but that's not biggest issue here. The issue here is Huma's husband, Anthony Weiner. Weiner isn't just the former Mayor of NYC. During the 2016 campign, it came out that Weiner was sexting minors. In 2017 he was [convicted of transmitting obscene material to a minor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner_sexting_scandals)

Carter **NEVER** served on a nuclear sub. He went to school for it in 1952/53, and left the Navy in 1953 when his father died, to take over the family's peanut farm business.

Also, Reagan was 13 years older than Carter. His military career began in 1937 and ended with the end of WW2, in 1945. Whereas, Carter's military career began in 1946. So when Reagan acted in the 1951 film *Bedtime for Bonzo*, he was already a 40-year-old actor, and Carter was a 27-year-old Naval officer.",Sympathy_for_the_FO,ea7dmud,The_Donald

People die like this in Canada all the time, and they just tell the families that they died on route to the hospital.

I won't even get started on the **more than yearlong wait (64 weeks) for neurosurgery.** Enjoy losing your job and your home because you're bedridden with a serious back or neck problem. Oh also by the time your surgery comes around you're now addicted to opiates.

FYI private clinics inside Canada perform neurosurgeries with an average wait time of about a week, forcing many Canadians to spend tens of thousands of dollars for healthcare on top of what they already paid for and arent receiving.

This is ""free healthcare."" It's terrible to the point of killing you or making you a drug addict but there's nothing you can do because there's no competing service.

As is typical, the government initially fought against private services because socialists don't want to help all people, they want them to suffer equally.

"I don't personally know about Canada but the info provided by others in this chain is compelling. I come from a country with free healthcare and since the system was put in practice the waiting time for almost any treatment with the exception of dental care sky rocketed to the point that to get a simple appointment with a neurologist to be examined you first need a pass to be given to you by general doctors which can be done after hours of waiting but costs the equivalent to $10, then you get the appointment for about 30 days later with the specialist which costs another $10, who will then ask you for MRI, CTI or Radiography (only one of those if you are lucky) for which you'll have to wait two weeks to perform and then two more for the results at a cost of about $100 each. Then take the results back to the specialist for a definitive diagnosis so in the best case scenario you are looking at a two and a half month waiting period and about $200 just to get diagnosed with something, while in the meantime the healthcare system takes 10% of your monthly income.

"My simple plan for reforming college loans.

Step One: federalize all current college debt, and allow for repayment via payroll pretax line item, capped at 10% with a terminus of 20 years to repay, with all interest and penalties removed

Step two: reform bankruptcy code so that new college debt is dischargable

Step Three: stop issuing new student loans federally.

Step Four: private lenders will provide student loans.  Being subject to bankruptcy will now force lenders to vet lendees - what their grades are, what college and major they want, what their aptitude is for that material, review  standardized tests, what are the chances the lendee could repy the debt given the job prospects, etc.

Now that the private sector is on the hook for graduate's successes to guarantee repayment, they will now be the champions for their borrowers.  Silicon Valley wants to import more h1b's?  Too bad, Wall Street says this will hurt their customers. 

By taking market forces away from college loans, that's how so many people found themselves in a lifetime of debt, without a method to repay it.  By applying market pressure to colleges, womyn studies, SJW majors, pointless fine art degrees, all the crap and bullshit will be gone.  You'll have to convince a loan officer that you have the aptitude for a doctorate in social sciences before they write a check for an undergraduate degree. 

This will shut down colleges that don't get good jobs for their students, this will focus our education system in creating a workforce that meets demand and creates new markets in the future, and will put the resources of a bank behind students who have good grades and academic ability, but find themselves set against institutional bullshit of muh feels.  If a college removes a good performing student for arguing for conservative values, that college might find themselves on the wrong end of a bank's willingness to underwrite their activities.

Now, since the private sector is providing funding, instead of the federal government, accountability, career focused major programs, sensible campus policies, and an end to the Marxist indoctrination will all flow from it.

Will snowflakes get upset because lesbian dance theory is no longer a major program that anyone can join dissappears?  That social justice departments get disbanded and social science programs will have to be honest with their students about what kind of work is available at the baccalaureate level?  That business, stem, and law get the funding, with very little available to bullshit?

These are all good things.  And the start is very simple.  Let the market work it out. If a few hundred colleges dissappear, fine.  If all the internet colleges dissappear, great.  If universities devolve back to focused colleges and third rate schools have to compete not just for students but bankers to underwrite them, we'll see cost reductions and real reforms.

"Only Moron Trudeau gave them money after the Side of Beef lost an election by a landslide.

Coincidentally, Trudeau Foundation money only came pouring in when Trudeau came into power.  The Trudeau Foundation was getting $50,000 a year in donations, but that quickly jumped to a million, with suddenly offshore money too, when he became big in politics.

> Patrick Pichette, a Canadian who until 2015 was senior vice-president and chief financial officer of Google, and who sits on Bombardier‚Äôs board of directors, is also a director of the Trudeau Foundation. Correspondence between Pichette and the Trudeau Foundation in 2014, released as part of an access-to-information request, shows he helped secure US$25,000 from Google for sponsorship of a Trudeau Foundation conference.

> Google has lobbied federal officials 22 times since Justin Trudeau became prime minister. The company was under investigation by the Competition Bureau for alleged anti-competitive activities at the time Google made the donation in December 2014.  The Competition Bureau concluded its investigation without charges last spring.

Trudeau knows he has to give to the Clintons, as Uranium One and that strange cult and other things tie too many of Trudeau's friends and himself to the Clinton Machine.

"The hood is the female equivalent of the male foreskin. The hood/foreskin is the most sensitive part of both genitals, and circumcision is carried out in both sexes for the express purpose of reducing sexual pleasure and discouraging masturbation. Furthermore, there is no medical benefit for either males or females. ‚ÄúHygiene‚Äù has been used as an excuse for both, but the studies showing reduced STD transmission in males were the exact same kind of low-quality epidemiological study, lacking in statistical significance, that was used to justify other appallingly wrong public health policies such as telling people to avoid saturated fat and load up on carbs.

Just look up the history of male circumcision in the US and you‚Äôll find out what kind of perverted Victorian moralists were responsible for getting it started and what their motives were.",Pertinaxed,ea7q59u,The_Donald
The hood has many nerve endings and is involved in some sexual sensation.  It also protects the clitoris.  Removing the hood dampens stimulation but does not remove it.  The are more severe forms of fgm but they are rare.  The media always talks about the worst forms which is why people have such strong feelings about it.  The foreskin serves generally the same purpose and has similar nerve density.  Removal of the foreskin dampens sexual pleasure but obviously  does not kill it.  ,BrownsWinSB54,ea7nwj9,The_Donald

This is happening in Ann Arbor Michigan. There isn‚Äôt much opportunity for hunting in a heavily populated (liberal af) city. Sterilization is a pretty well proven method of controlling populations. I know the area and the only archery hunting options would be city parks that are heavily used.  I think they‚Äôre wasting money because we have some of the heaviest deer density in the country in the area surrounding the city so new deer will continue to filter in. If they really wanted to reduce deer numbers they would incentivize or at least promote allowing hunters access to the huntable land surrounding the city. ,diyforfun,ea8esem,The_Donald

Saudi Arabia can also trade oil for euro, ruble, or yuan. 

Saudi Arabia can trade euro for German guns, ruble for Russian guns, or yuan for Chinese guns. 

This would lessen our influence over Saudi Arabia and their oil, and weaken the dollar globally. 

They don't do that because we treat them favorably (turning a blind eye to human rights abuses that they use to control their citizens and weilding power in their registration). 

In doing so, the dollar remains the most valuable and stable store of value worldwide, and the quantity and type of their guns are known to us.

The Iranians chanting ""death to America"" are no different from the Saudis chanting ""death to Christians""

It might be better to stay allied with them in the short term, but in the long run they're only spreading the same ideology (Islam) which tries to destroy Western Civilisation for the past 1400 years. North-Africa is getting heavily islamisized by Saudi Arabia. Boko Haram wouldn't exist without Saudi Arabia.

You yourself responded with ""Fuck Islam"" to a post saying ""Islam is Cancer"", yet you want to partner with some of the most radical Muslims who are spreading Islam around the globe?

I don't want them to buy chinese or russian weapons or to ally with Iran. I want all these Muslim shitholes - including Saudi Arabia - to be colonized and controlled.

"Anyone read Plato's Republic?

&gt;*And the more detestable [the tyrant's] actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?*

&gt;**Certainly.**

&gt;*And who are the devoted band [of potential voters and bodyguards], and where will he procure them?*

&gt;**They will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if lie pays them.**

&gt;*By the dog! I said, here are more [useful idiots], of every sort and from every land.*

The above talks about how tyrants use Democracy to enact laws the native populace do no want. They simply import foreigners to vote and fight for them.

&gt;*But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up
son ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should
be supported by the son? The father did not bring him into being,
or settle him in life, in order that when his son became a man he
should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support
him and his rabble of slaves and companions; but that his son should
protect him, and that by his help he might be emancipated from the
government of the rich and aristocratic, as they are termed. And so
he bids him and his companions depart, just as any other father might
drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates.*

&gt;**By heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster he
has been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out,
he will find that he is weak and his son strong.** 

&gt;*Why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? What!
beat his father if he opposes him?*

&gt;**Yes, he will, having first disarmed him.**

This section talks about how the tyrant desires to disarm the natives so they cannot fight back against this soft genocide being inflicted on them.

Then as history shows: demographics are destiny. People who are not enthralled in a democratic mentality vote for their own kind since the only way they can protect their tribe from being subjugated is to have their tribe in power and subjugate everyone else. (Another fact of life proven by the Greeks)

Looking at our world today we see America's fall into tyranny. Hart-Cellar built up the ~~tyrants~~ Democrat's support, they now seek to disarm us, but their foreign horde seeks to replace them as well. AOC's district is a minority-majority district and they voted out the white-bread leftist incumbent to put her in. Same with your point about Somalis.

JFK‚Äôs administration, who was kept by LBJ, all supported expanding Vietnam activities including the overthrow of Diem with the exception of George Ball, he was the only one close to the president who opposed escalation. The growth of the advisor program, huge aid packages and the coup all took place under JFK. He only once, at a speech at the American University, hinted at getting out, but never seriously considered it anywhere else on or off record.  He was administration, particularly McNamara and the Joint Chiefs, all convinced JFK to get more involved, which he would have done. LBJ, who didn‚Äôt care much about foreign policy, just followed the course JFK set. 

JFK defined the growth of the deep state - he empowered the CIA, encouraged ‚Äúflexible response‚Äù using CIA/covert actions rather than MAD deterrence, and actively sought to challenge communism globally, including using CIA meddling in places unaligned, like South America.

However, article 1 states that congress can create any law that ‚Äúnecessary and proper‚Äù in order to execute its duties; minting (printing) currency would be one of those duties. And as the law stands, Congress cannot influence the fed to change interest rates or to print more money, making them completely independent from political influence. 

I understand why people are opposed to the fed, as they can be seen as a hamper to economic growth, but the fact is, without them our economy would be incredibly unstable and we would likely see 2008 levels of financial ruin every time we have a recession. ",yoloswagginnigga,ea7wwyr,The_Donald

>First on the list is 12-year term limits for members of Congress, which means two full Senate terms or six full House terms.

Generally, I feel like term limits are bad because you're going to wind up with lobbyists who are more experienced than the members of Congress.  But, 12 years is reasonable.  I just wonder if this is going to come back to embarrass Scott if he wants to run for a third term.  See Orrin Hatch.

Also, this would probably require a constitutional amendment.

>Full time salary for full time work: Scott wants lawmakers to work five days a week, either in Washington or in their District offices.

I don't think this is practical.  It might sound easy to a guy like Scott, who can afford private planes and comes from Florida, only a couple hours away from DC by plane.  But if you're a regular member of Congress west of the Mississippi, it takes two days of flying commercial to get to DC and back.  Unless travel time is included in Scott's plan, this would basically keep members from traveling home.  And if travel time is included, well, people are already working five days a week, so this is pointless.

>Stop lawmakers from cashing in as lobbyists: He wants a minimum of ten years to pass before former Congress members can lobby.

This is good, although it will probably just cause people to go straight to lobbying.  We don't want former members of Congress to exploit their service for profit, but we also don't want to scare normal people away from politics by not making it a viable career option.  Then, politics will just be filled with rich people who can afford to not have a career.

> Lawmakers should not be allowed to vote for their own pay raises and pensions. He wants their salaries locked in from the day they start to the day they leave; and ""since serving in Congress should not be a career,"" Scott says taxpayers should not foot the bill for congressional pensions.

This is just wrong.  Scott doesn't seem to understand how pay raises work in Congress now.  Lawmakers actually don't vote on them anymore.  They haven't since 1991.  Salary raises are tied to automatic cost of living increases for all federal employees.  And Congress actually passed laws to freeze their own raises in 2009.

>No more insurance subsidies for Congress members or their staff.

This is just cruel to the staff members, who make an average of $50,000 per year, which is not much in DC.  It just seems like punishing people for entering public service.

>Require a supermajority vote of two-thirds in each chamber to approve any tax hike or fee increase.

Obviously the idea here is to never increase anything ever again.  It would be great if that happened.  But it's foolish to statutorily tie your hands like this.  

>No budget, no pay: Scott says lawmakers' salaries should be withheld until members pass an annual budget and meet appropriations deadlines.

Fine idea, but Congress rarely actually fails to pass budgets.  When they do, you get the Schumer Shutdown and that's rare.  Typically, they just move the deadline.

>Line item veto to allow president to remove pork-barrel spending (moves to accomplish this have failed in the past).

Unconstitutional.

>End government waste: Scott wants to eliminate omnibus spending.

I feel like this would produce a waste of a lot of time because each part of the omnibus would need to be passed individually.

>Improve transparency and accountability. This includes reforming the Congressional Budget Office.


Fine, although I'm wary of interfering with nonpartisan parts of the government.",T2r0u2m0p2020,ea7i452,The_Donald

It started great! Socrates' definition of ""The Good"", Kant's Categorical Imperative, and Hedonistic Calculus were fascinating subjects. Exploring the thought process and morality of assisted medicinal suicide and suicide bombers were very thought provoking and gave me great perspectives on what I previously dismissed as clear cut issues.

Another friend (friend's wife actually), $40k in student loans. Even in this economy, she can't hold a job for more than 6 months because she's that incompetent.

Meanwhile another friend that didn't even go to college? Successful business with over 25 full time employees. Spends his time just thinking ""how do I get bigger and make even more money?"". Still has enough free time and expendable income to do whatever he wants.

Me? I only went to college because I got a full scholarship. Not a single person has ever asked me if I went to college. I've never used it. I have a business that runs itself with minimal oversight (also like my friend), consider myself semi retired, and I'm also thinking ""what should I do next"".

It would be like an Obama Supreme Court overturning a big Trump victory of legislation, on the same level as his Tax Bill. 

Again, Roberts is no Globalist. He's Conservative in his heart. He voted down the Voting Rights Act, which was HUGE and effectively made it easier for states to run their elections without Leftist interference.

Tips:
1) dont take out a loan for investing
2) dont use student loans for investing (seriously)
3) only invest what you are willing/able to lose
4) dont FOMO (fear of missing out) invest, plan your moves and most important plan your exit strategy too
5) sign up for TD Ameritrade PaperMoney which gives you 200k to mess around with in fake money
6) dont buy the dip
7) dont try to catch a falling knife
8) TA and FA are only guides and not gospel
9) take your gains when you can, no one ever went broke taking a 10-20% gain
10) come up with strategies that fit YOU best
11) try to diversify if you have a lot of $ so if one sector (tech) dies then your McDonalds stocks may still do well
12) avoid low volume options if you choose to play derivatives

Explained that this gender role shit has got out of hand and the idiots in the asylum have hijacked any semblance of respect the movement once had. She broke down again. Apparently, everything hit home and that was her redpill moment.

It's the paradox of progressivism that progress destroys it - if at any time they run out of issues to ""correct"", then they are no longer progressive.

This is true for any reactionary movement - what do they do when they run out of important things to react to? Give up, or go after the unimportant things? What about when they run out of those? Give up, or go after the trivial things? What about when they run out of those? ...

Hence why you see so much scraping of the bottoms of barrels.

This isn't such a big issue for legitimate progressive movements (note for example that the civil right's movement has largely packed up its things and gone home, job well done), but for movements that require agitation, have the need to stay ""relevant"" over the need to make actual change?

All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

It‚Äôs important to note that we didn‚Äôt stop refueling their fighters until they could refuel themselves in the air.

They even tried to pay veterans to protest JASTA so they couldn‚Äôt be sued for damages from 9/11. They are a major funding source for terrorism worldwide and they are the source of a lot of problems in the Middle East. They are not our friends; never have been, never will be.

"As someone who lives in the UK, my family and I have nothing but good to say about the NHS for the most part, they've always been pretty good with us, especially seeing as out of my 22 years on this planet, I've had problems with my legs for 20 of them, had surgery and constant appointments at least once a month.l, something my family would never have been able to afford through private healthcare.

The problem in the UK is with ""health tourism"", where people travel to the UK to use the NHS then bugger off, leaving us British taxpayers to foot the bill. The NHS was ruined under Tony Blair, where he changed the way our hospitals were ran so that it became a business rather than a service. But I wouldn't want it to be taken away. I may not be a socialist but I won't deny that I think our NHS is one of the few socialist policies we've had put in place that I would actually pay more in tax every payday if I could.

"Been said already but bears repeating: do NOT carry cocked and unlocked. For semi-auto hammer-fired pistols, single action (e.g. 1911) is usually carried ""cocked and locked"" (hammer back, safety on), while a double action (e.g. CZ-75) can be carried like that or with hammer down & safety off (like a double action revolver). Sometimes a single is carried hammer down too (like a single action revolver), so you would have to thumb the hammer back to fire. Striker fired you can safely carry with one in the chamber with or without a safety, but you could come down with a nasty case of glock leg if your drawstroke is fucked. That's for carry with a loaded chamber. And always carry on-body.

Many people ""Israeli carry"" with safety off and chamber empty so they have to chamber a round if they need to use it. Disadvantage is it's slower and if you fuck up you can jam your gun when you need it most, advantage is that it is literally impossible for your gun to discharge like that, mechanical failures included.",judasnotiscariot,ea6m8hj,The_Donald
"This is a fair question. Safety off is always a bad choice. You're more likely to hurt yourself (and others) with the safety off around town than with the safety on in a dangerous situation (just because you're unlikely to be in a shooting situation if nothing else). 

Not that I've ever needed to use a concealed weapon, but I don't think the idea is you get into a cowboy shoot out with the two of you staring at each other. The idea is you get the drop on someone because they don't know you have a weapon until it's out and ready, but you should never cc a weapon you're not comfortable with. You can avoid the finicking about by going to shooting ranges and practicing with your weapon (which you should always do with any firearm you own). It shouldn't take several seconds to get there safety off of a weapon you know. I'm not an expert by any means but I think this is fairly basic advice I've received.",moose-rider32,ea67rr7,The_Donald

And then all of the tribes and nations GAVE UP without fighting the Europeans, and they EASILY trounced over us and did not have any type of struggle with it at all. 

So what we SHOULD do is totally not integrate, and instead of asking for programs to supports, preserve, and EXPAND our cultural heritage, we should just be DIVERSE and slowly die on the Res. 

this way, real Natives like Elizabeth Warren can tick a box and get six figure salaries, while we're told we're stupid for wanting officials to focus on things like bringing in more low-skill or manufacturing jobs that used to be here so that we can break poverty and alcoholism cycles in our tribal communities, and loosen the grip of the tribal leaders that reap most of the benefits of the ""We're sorry"" programs and well-off white leftists pat us on the head and make pity-praise remarks about our ""wonderful, rich history"" they know nothing about.

"I think it‚Äôs safe to say European settlers subsumed Native culture in far greater percentages than other cultures in the past under similar circumstances, most of whom were just extinguished. Some Natives were hospitable and taught European settlers their land, others fought, and most were somewhere in between. It‚Äôs complicated and vast and many endured unfair treatment, but is there another culture that is ‚Äúcooler‚Äù to have blood from than the native Americans? Regardless of the collegiate and financial perks, it would seem most Americans who find out they have even a smidge of Native blood are excited about it. It‚Äôs normal to us but is seemingly abnormal in the context of history, if you think about it.",mintak4,ea6qhem,The_Donald
"A lot of American culture was shaped by the Native Americans.  Not necessarily influenced in an imitation sort of way, although partially that.  But relations with the Natives were a part of life in America up through wwI.  They were still fighting apaches outside San Diego in like the 1920s. 

the culture of America as it was built was a culture that existed in relief from two forces, the Europeans and the Native Americans 

The toughness of American settlers obv lends itself to Clint Eastwood movies etc and in a greater sense to things like how American sentiment and mentality was shaped for conflicts like WW2 and Vietnam.  The toughness, the sense of making it alone, the sense of conquering the wilderness or taming the untamable to make it part of our culture and to reap its bounty and make it stable.  

All of that comes from imitating, fighting, or working with the natives.

Or like Andrew Jackson.  The original democrat, a horrible boogeyman if Native American history. But. He himself revered the Natives in a loopy way where he considered his own hardness of will to be in the Native American tradition. 

George Washington‚Äôs first military engagement was a battle in the French Indian war where his British unit got routed and nearly annihilated by Iroquois sharpshooters, and most of the casualties occured during the chaotic retreat. Flash forward to the revolutionary war, and George Washingtons primary talent as a tactition was for the successful implementation of tactical retreats without being routed.

Abraham Lincoln was ‚Äúborn in a log cabin‚Äù.  The entire significance of that hardship is in the context of the frontier being Native Territory.

America isn‚Äôt British, it‚Äôs the remainder of the British being influenced by the natives instead of the English for a few hundred years

I feel like so many people talk about black/hispanic neighborhoods and forget about the ""other"" minority out there, when we could actually come out a lot stronger.

That said, I don't find it helpful for us to keep demanding recompense for broken treaties signed by men long since dead and demanding enforcement of agreements we never had a part in. I don't think annexing (""returning"") large portions of great plains states is in our best interest, nor does it heal any of the real schism in the tribal communities. 

It just seems like most of the responses to help STILL insist on keep everyone on the Res.  And it's, in my opinion, the WORST thing being done because it simply makes caste system where tribal leaders end up benefiting from the concessions and programs designed to help everyone. Sure, some tribes operate a little better than others, but most of the ""common folk"" are dealing with poverty and alcoholism because we're told we SHOULDN'T be integrating into greater society. 

I don't want that. I want people to help preserve our communities in the same way they would preserve their own.  I want a real effort to maybe have an outreach about REAL Native culture, and REAL Native history, and not this ""Noble Savage smoke-um peace pipe oh poor indigenous peoples chased off their land by mean whites"" thing that's been going on since, at least the 70's.

"I believe the allegation was only ""extremist"" and that only appeared in the executive summary of a Vancouver sheriff internal report. The report internals made that same statement ""extremist"" but did not support it and had no other detail from the FBI. It seemed a very generic statement  and it seems also that it would be proper for this kind of statement to be attributed in more detail to the FBI. In other words, if the FBI actually said such a thing, it should be attributed more specifically in this type of report, i.e. ""A spokesman for the Vancouver field office of the FBI stated on XXXXX date that ..."" . Or perhaps if there was a written list of extremist groups in the area it would be lined or referenced. I think the lack of these details makes the claim highly suspect. Real journalists would be looking into this aspect, but what we have instead is many, many outlets simply repeating it.

"First of all, this is why they‚Äôre called fake news: ‚ÄúThe fall economic statement delivers $17.6 billion in new spending over six years ‚Äî about $16.5 billion of it in foregone revenue to boost Canadian business productivity‚Äù

*Not collecting taxes, or allowing write offs on taxes-is not the same as increasing spending*.

This I some of the most pernicious lies the socialists in media constantly spin, the a tax break is the same as gov spending. It is not. It is letting you or a business keep more of your or their own money. For example- write offs on equipment. When you allow more write offs- guess what- you get more equipment spending. But what the gov and socialists do, is they give the write off, businesses spend more on equipment than they would have, and then the socialists claims that the write off on all of that equipment that the businesses would not have bought is included in ‚Äúspending‚Äù.

They constantly do the opposite with new taxes- they say, ok, projected spending is 100B and taxes are currently 10%, so if we increase that to 15%, that means we collect 15B! Except, they ignore that in the real world when you put taxes up by 50%, *the spending drops*, so you no longer collect 15B.

He still has a court hearing on 12/5/2018 @ 8:30AM PST for the reduction of the charge. In theory and practice, he should also still have a court date for restraining order. Although, he could simply not show up and simply default on it.

"> does it just ""feel"" that way to you

not about fee fees. About math. For a very long time, there wasnt any ""proof"" that russiagate was all an elaborate hoax, even though I told you from the beginning thats exactly what it was. Now, its common knowledge - have you even seen any of Papadopolous' tweets? Anyway, not having ""proof"" of the magnitude nor orchestration/organization doesnt mean anything beyond that it was   effectively concealed. There **COULD NOT BE** any details organized nationally, as all the details are very state specific.  The DNC nationally could only do so much, just give moral support essentially, it had to be (and was) state level boots on the ground exploiting in accordance with each states specific rules. And even then, it makes logical sense that only certain COUNTIES actually engaged in fraudulent behavior, it likely wasnt ALL of them, probably not even most. Look at Broward and Palm Beach in FL. At the county level, there are MANY reports, even ongoing criminal investigations.

But just because organization and orchestration would have been focused at the county and somewhat state levels doesnt mean it didnt occur.

The math exposes the reality, no matter what you say. Theres NO mathematical possibility for this outcome.

">elections aren't coin tosses subject to mathematical probabilities

this shows you know nothing about math.
we arent talking about the elections in general. we are talking about the incidence of ""late votes"" (after election day) changing the election day tally from the election day winner to the other side. When the 2 sides are within 10 points of each other in terms of general population (and they nearly always are), that means the mathematical probability of any such ""swing"" after election day is somewhere around 50/50 for either side, depending on the ED gap to be made up. The probability of EVERY SINGLE ONE of these unlikely ""flips"" going to ONE side only is mathematically impossible if the cause was mere inefficiency and happenstance.

The other way we can use math here is the ""split ticket"" phenomenon. Rush talks about it:

"I'm not concerned with the politics right now, but your use of the word math is bothering me. You make assumptions like  ""somewhere around 50/50 for either side"" without justification. Why are the reasons you listed the only possible reasons for the flipping. If you want to model the situation with those assumptions, you should state that you are making assumptions and that if they are assumed, the rest follows.

Also, even if we assume your assumptions to be true, what math are you using the prove that what happened is a ""mathematical impossibility""? If there was a truly 50/50 chance of either party winning each contested election, then the chance of one party winning N elections is 1/(2\^N), which is never 0.

Am I missing something?

EDIT: I also have a big issue with this statement:   


""Math is ALWAYS right, it isnt subjective, and doesnt favor anyone."" 

This is certainly not true. It is not even clear what it means. Humans certainly apply math incorrectly all the time. How you model a situation is absolutely subjective. No data fits any model perfectly. Instead, we find the 'best fit.' There are rules defining best fit, but those are also subjective. There are multiple ways to define 'best fit.'

Let's assume again that there is actually a 50/50 chance of either party winning a contested election. If only one of these occurred and democrats won it, that certainly wouldn't point to them defying the odds. If the won 2 such elections? That is less likely, but would still happen 25% of the time, so I wouldn't feel that it obviously indicated something underhanded by itself. 3 elections? 5 elections?

yes you are.

Again, we are talking about the ED results VS ""late counting"".

All voting tallies should be done by EoD on election day, with the only exception being mail in and provisional ballots. Yes? Can we agree on that?

So no matter who is leading at EoD, a D or R, those results are FINAL except for provisional/mail in.

NOW we get to individual state laws. States all have various technical rules, but they ARE State law, and arent just suggestions.

They should not end up favoring any one party in any given district/precinct beyond the norm for that district. Correct?

If those provisionals/absentees DO favor one, and overwhelmingly so, then there must be a cause, because the INTENT from ALL parties should be to have as close to 100% reported on ED by EoD as possible, while being aware of being inclusive for all valid voters.

So if these ALL go to favor overwhelmingly the Dems (and I would say a result of 20 something to zero is meaningful), then I would say the system and rules in those counties 1) was not efficient at counting an accurate total by EoD on ED and 2) the mail ins/provisionals are super-overweighting the ED results

Ok, there is likely a cause (not must be, sometimes rare events do happen). But, that cause might be reasonable. Are the types of people who tend to vote democrat more likely to use mail in ballots? I don't know, but it certainly could be and I'm not prepared to rule it out without evidence. 

> Again, can only be 2 causes. Just accidental systemic structure inefficiency (incompetence in design and implementation), or intentional inefficiency (to enable fraud). 

Why is it inefficient to wait a couple of days for results? If letting people vote who are away, have difficulty with mobility, had to work on election day, etc., means we have to wait an extra few days for results, I can be patient. I had my mail in ballot returned this year because my signature didn't match my old signature closely enough. I had to sign a statement and send it in again. There were no tight elections near me, so everything was called anyhow, but if they had been tight, mine would be one of the votes that they were waiting for before making the call. I wouldn't call that inefficiency. 

> To repeat, if it was ACCIDENTAL structural inefficiency, the results of ""flipping"" from ED wouldnt be 20 something to zero. **THE MATH EXPOSES THE TRUTH** 

I'm not sure what to say about this. I honestly don't see how your arguments add up to this. If I flip a coin 20 times, getting 20 heads is very, very, unlikely (about 1 in a million), but not impossible. The odds of winning the mega millions are less than that, but people do win.

because it invites FRAUD, thats why. There is a reason absentee and mail ins have deadlines and controls. Proovisionals should have the same deadlines and controls. For example, by EoD all mail-ins should already be IN, and for provisionals, at least the number cast should be in. NO EXCUSE to be ""finding"" provisionals days later. You get to the polls voting day OR you vote early OR you mail in BY the date.

"You mean the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA), the act that effectively shut down the ATF's practice of illegally harassing FFL owners.¬† FOPA also redressed and nullified most of the shitty provisions found in the Gun Control Act of 1968--a horribly written bill that gave the government a very wide berth in abusing its power over 2A gun ownership. 

FOPA also included the Safe Passage provision, that finally stopped States from arresting lawful gun owners who were simply in transit through their gun-unfriendly territories.  You can thank Reagan for passing the bill because now you can travel anywhere in the U.S. with your weapons without being arrested. In theory at least, as we all know that unfriendly States and their liberal legislators continue to ignore the laws as written and abuse the hell out of our 2A rights.

FOPA had one major flaw: the amendment prevented full-auto weapons purchases after 1986. On the bright side (somewhat...), it did allow ownership of fully automatic weapons manufactured prior to the bill's passing.

FOPA was long overdue, but once passed, it put an immediate stop to an out of control and abusive ATF. That alone made it worth its weight in gold. 



I hope that one day the full-auto provision will be redressed in the same way that the Gun Control Act of 1968 was with Fopa.  Select Fire weapons are cool to be sure, but they are a complete waste of ammo. Unless you need to lay down a shiload of covering fire, or slow the advance of a battalion of bad guys, full auto is useless feature.

Not at Kanye for protecting his property (good on him, even more props for helping defend his neighbours properties too) - but at the State, County and Federal governments (in that order) for allowing such a situation to exist that someone even *needed* private firefighters.

This is what government is supposed to even be for - if they can't manage this - why do they even exist?

As a solution though, apart from proper forest management (burn offs which should be conducted by fire depts or the state environment dept.) - Maybe it's time California looked at Australia's CFS/CFA/RFS fire departments, we have similar conditions to California and lots of sparsely populated areas - to cover them all with paid firefighters would send the states broke real quick.

So instead we have a mix of more traditional metro services (paid/employed firefighters) and in rural/country areas we have volunteer fire services, the state pays for the appliances, stations, protective equipment/training/insurance/etc - but the firefighters are volunteers with pagers - doing regular everyday work until they get the call.

"> Every generation has been told this. It's just that now it is more difficult to find things to save, so they invent low hanging fruit.

Disney has really promoted the idea of everyone being a rebellious snowflake hero saving the day.


Pre-Disney most kids were told to be polite and humble, work hard, respect God and your elders, and that people who ignore the laws of society and disrespect their elders are bad.


Post-Disney everyone raised to believe that they are the Aladin or Mulan Diamond-in-the-rough chosen one and the protagonist and hero of their own story and leader of the rebellion. They are taught that cultural tradition is bad and should be ignored if your emotions say they should be.



Most of the Fairy Tales Disney movies were based on were warnings. The original Little Mermaid story by Hans Christian Anderson was a warning.

>I could point to a hundred examples in history where civilization got screwed over by a hero complex, and none of them involved Disney.


I'm not saying Disney is the sole root of the snowflake culture, but Disney certainly is a social engineering company. They spent the past 100 years or so promoting the ideas of true love and soul mates who will perfectly complete you and lead to a happily ever after. Disney Channel today is just a bunch of shows of snotty kids sarcastically mocking each other, while being rude to adults and authority figures. All the while the snotty children are portrayed as knowing more than and being smarter than everyone else around them.


Disney is social engineering first, profits second. Disney did not create the idea of the hero complex of course, but they have spent 100 years during their best to promote hero complexes in children all over the world.


Back in the day, heroes were seen as loyal people who followed orders and had respect. Look for example at Knight In Panther's Skin, or other older epics.

""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" is from the Declaration Of Independence. One could claim (and logically rightfully so) that deliberately killing an infant (via abortion) is a clear violation of that infant's rights to the aforementioned phrase. 



(Also related: In a case of an auto accident/etc where a pregnant woman and/or her unborn infant is killed, the perp can be charged with the death of that pre-born infant. It is not seen as a ""clump of cells"" by the court system, it is seen as a pre-born infant person thus its death/injury results in legal charges. I find it very strange that the very same court system flip-flops around and sees a viable fetus either as a ""victim"" or as a ""clump of cells"" based on the mother's attitude toward the pre-born infant, in terms of her desire to keep or discard it.)",independentbystander,ea6gda9,The_Donald

"Hey guys,

Hope we can have a good dialouge. But I need to get the understanding and definitions straight. I live in Germany and I couldn't imagine living without health care, (kinda) free college (270 Euros for one semester, considering that I can use Public transportation for free you could say it's free). For me these, beside other factors are fundamental to be considered a first world country.

But now to the main part. Those parts have absolutely nothing to do with socialism. Scandinavian countries, Germany or nearly every other European countries are NOT based on socialism. They are called social states (in German we call it Sozialstaat or maybe Wohlfahrtsstaat). And they are primarily reasons we in Germany have more equality of opportunity. Our society isn't as such exclusive like America. Believe when I say it's good to have chances regardless of your race, religion and most important of your social and economic status. And it is good to have a system that doesn't leave you in dept when you fail.

My definition of social justice is:
Social justice is when people have fair and equal access to education, health and work. If no one is let down on life risks, but diligence and talent can make differences.

One personal story:
I once broke my leg while I had a game. I was delivered into the hospital and they took care of me. And it was all for free(beside paying monthly to my insurance company). And as I was in the hospital I thought about living in America. And man I would leave myself in such a financial debt that would limit my life quality for the next months.

Same goes with college. How the fuck would am I supposed to pay bills.

Really, this is real progress (not the shit the cool new left claim to be) and it has nothing to do with socialism.

Yeah I know there many things bad things going on in Germany like those high taxes and the Desaster of Immigration policy.

"You stated in your last sentance the issue: Desaster of Immigration policy

At some point, all of these people entering your country without contributing are going to break your social systems.  It is already starting to happen in Sweden and other members of the EU.

Specifically healthcare: our system is financially and morally broken.  The cost for a doctor to do business is so high due to the insurance they have to carry, that those costs get passed on to the consumer.  The cost to process a claim with an insurance company is high for the doctor as well.  If you elect to pay out of pocket, you can get treatment much cheaper and there are some clinics that do not accept insurance at all and you know how much you are going to pay up front.  However, government does not run anything efficiently.  The amount of waste in the medicare system is so high that we know where this will go.  On the moral side, doctors used to give their time to volunteer clinics as a matter of course.  Due to malpractice insurance requirements, this is no longer the case.

College has become big business in this country due to the government providing guaranteed student loans.  Since the inception of this, the cost of college has sky rocketed.  Prior to this, many state colleges cost about $500/semester.  

The reasons these things cost so much is because of the interference of government.  The proposed solution is more government.  Doesn't seem very logical to me.

Defining something as a right doesn't make it so.  There is a logic test that goes along with it.  The government doesn't give anything to anyone.  If it gives anything to anyone it has first taken from someone else.  That is also why your taxes are so high.",tdwinton74,ea6mgx7,The_Donald

"The Republic, as enacted by the USA, is a representative democracy... For some elections.

But it was designed more complexly than that.

For example, the Senate used to be elected by state legislatures, not directly, so that wasn't Democratic (or at least it had at least one degree of separation).  The Electoral College basically makes the Presidential election non-democratic, by design, to ensure that the interests of all states are represented.

Republic, itself, does NOT mean democratic.  It means the government is, in some way, controlled by the governed.  For five hundred years the Roman Republic had a Senate of aristocrats controlled by Consols elected by the Plebs.

It just so happens that the preferred republic in America is representative democracy, but I'd bet a clever person could set up a res publica system like Rome, or a commune, or a direct democracy, and argue that it's still a Republic.

"But is the guaranteed student loan really the reasons for the high college costs. And to clarify what is, beside the elite colleges, the average college fee?

And back to the immigration. Yes you are right that immigrants who don't contribute to the governmental household and society in general, are in fact overloading our social systems. But you need to consider that they are benefitial in the long run. When you look at our demografics (in German the process is called Demografische Wandel, roughly translated into demographic change) our society is slowly getting older and the birth rate goes down. So there is a chance that the 2nd or 3rd generation of the immigrants can save our demografic and social system.

Then you can argue from a cultural standpoint. Yes the ""German culture"" is clearly going to die. But the question is: Don't all cultures and the identity that goes with it will slowly merge into a globalized and unitary culture? And that will more likely be the trend. In fact this isn't the first immigration wave German has faced. The Turkish foreign workers from 80s and 90s are already in the 3rd generation. And I can tell you many friends don't even are Muslims anymore and assimilated to the western values and culture. But on the other hands the circumstances are and were completely different.

And to give you my opinion on the immigration policy:

I think it's just completely mismanaged. In my opinion it's our humanitarian and moral duty to help those people. Especially when we and the actions of our governments are the reason why they needed to flee. But to let them in uncontrollable into the European union is the worst way you could do it.

This kind of very indirect democracy is still present within Germany for example and to an extent in every parliamentary system, you elect a party and the party decides whoever the hell they want to appoint to the most powerful positions, and in the case of Germany they also appoint the president.


>Republic, itself, does NOT mean democratic. It means the government is, in some way, controlled by the governed. For five hundred years the Roman Republic had a Senate of aristocrats controlled by Consols elected by the Plebs.

Oh yes it does, and don't go the historic paths because very fucky things were called a ""democracy"" the first form of democracy wouldn't be considered a democracy, not even by a longshot, today. Republic is basically synonymous with representative democracy, you vote for people that you want to be making the decisions.

">But is the guaranteed student loan really the reasons for the high college costs. And to clarify what is, beside the elite colleges, the average college fee?

It's a cycle.  The colleges know that they have garaunteed $ coming from the government in the form of student loans.  They build their college to attract more people, raising rates.  Text book prices inflate at the same rate.  I was a part of the first generation to have these types of student loans available.  When I went to college in 92, Per semester tuition room and board was $4000.  Today, same school, per semester $16000.

If the immigrants are going to assimilate into society, all of that works.  IT has been that way in the US and most of the rest of the world and has been the greatest benefit to western society.  This was the expected norm.

However, what we see today with predominantly muslim migrants is they do not assimilate.  They isolate and expect accommodation for their culture.  Once given an inch, they keep pushing and the inches become feet.  This is the difference between the example you provided in the 80s and 90s and today.

Otherwise being engaged in the ""pursuit of happiness"" would provide an eminently suitable defense for a good many victimless crimes.  That said, I would dearly love to see our representatives affirm the Declaration; COMPLETE with the original 'anti-slavery' paragraph.  In an age where so many are trying to paint America as a perennial force of evil and oppression, and tearing down monuments to our history, it would be refreshing to point out what SOME of our founding fathers knew was the right thing to do all along.  That fact that such a symbolic act could GIVE the Declaration legal relevance would only be a bonus:  and what Congressman would want to go on record refusing to assent to an anti-slavery document?    
    
I sent a letter to President Trump a few months ago on this very topic.

[""Move slowly, carefully --- and then strike like the fastest animal on the planet!""](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/380922018717515776) - Our President of the United States of America people.

He'll make sure to take all the time he needs to bring them all down. Wouldn't you want that with a grueling wait instead of trying to do it too early and letting them get away? You don't think the Deep State isn't making counter-moves?

**The Senate was key** for our President's plan as we needed to drain the swamp on the prosecution system of our country to make sure the convictions hold true. Senate comfirms Judges! We now can do that without backstabbing RINO's like Flake and Corker. Also why do you think they were trying to steal back the election in Florida and Arizona? We're winning!

First, even though it says Sealed Indictments, these are actually sealed court proceedings filed is US District Courts. That may include indictments, but it also includes requests for search warrants, requests for surveillance, requests for evidence, requests for information, requests for substantiation, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Basically, everything about the case, the investigation, and the actions of the court are all sealed and require specific procedures for access to the information. 

There may not be any actual indictments in there at all. I'm assuming that there are at least a few, but there is no real way to know how many. I would guess that the vast, vast majority are simply procedural documents for access to information held by the many different alphabet and/or law enforcement agencies. 

If there are actually any sealed indictments in there, then we will eventually find out, as they will have to be unsealed for the individuals to be charged and tried. Indictments require felony charge(s), so there is that to consider.

You probably know that Mexico invited lots of American settlers into the northern territories of Mexico, if they'd promise to 1) to become Mexican citizens, 2) speak Spanish and 3) convert to Catholicism. Settlers came, but they flouted the rules and brought slaves with them. Eventually the settlers threw off their Mexican oppressors and became the Republic of Texas. The rest is history. Anyway, my argument is simply that the Mexican government wasn't invading so much as putting down a rebellion. But whatever. Mexico lost that one.

"The story about Ivank is 14 months old and is proof of timed news outrage.

""At the time the emails were sent, February 28, Trump was working at the White House in a non-official capacity. However, she was attending White House meetings prior to becoming an official (yet unpaid) federal employee in March.

According to a White House spokesperson, Newsweek reports, one reason Trump became a federal employee was so she could ‚Äúhave access to government-issued communications devices and receive an official email account to protect government records.‚Äù

"What Hillary did and what Ivanka did are two very different issues.  

Hillary was the Secretary of State.  

Ivanka was at the White House in a non-official capacity.

Are emails of the Secretary of State Official Records?  Yes.  (Federal Records Act of 1950)  

Does the US Government have laws dealing with E Mail? Yes (FRA in 1995)

Was Secretary of State Clinton in violation of those laws? Yes

Does it matter if she kept them secure?  No

Can the government seize the servers and backups legally?  Yes

Should she be prosecuted like Snowden for taking state emails?  


US Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 5 Information Management
5 FAM 443
http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/

Here is the Federal Records Act, passed in 1950: The head of each Federal agency shall make and preserve records containing adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the agency and designed to furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the Government and of persons directly affected by the agency‚Äôs activities. (44 U.S. Code ¬ß 3101) 

Here is the State Department‚Äôs own treatment of the question from 1995: Another important modern improvement is the ease of communication now afforded to the Department world-wide through the use of E-mail. . . . All employees must be aware that some of the variety of the messages being exchanged on E-mail are important to the Department and must be preserved; such messages are considered Federal records under the law. (5 FAM [Foreign Affairs Manual] 443.1) In fact, step-by-step guidance was being offered to employees two decades ago about how to preserve email records. So if Clinton failed to follow procedures, it was not for lack of available instruction on the subject.

"The media is applying the same no-win spectrum to this situation as it does to most of Trump's other foreign relations dealings. 

On the low end of the spectrum, Trump is accused of ""not doing enough."" As we move up the spectrum, Trump is accused of *still* not doing enough. 

At some point in the middle, the switch occurs, and from that point on, Trump's actions are characterized as reckless and dangerous. 

Almost one week ago, US Treasury announced Magnitsky sanctions against 17 Saudi's with suspected involvement in the killing. Furthermore, the [Saudi government](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/saudi-prosecutor-seeks-death-penalty-suspects-khashoggi-s-killing-n936496) has arrested 21, charged 11, and is pursuing capital punishment against 5.  

Now... let's be real. What happened is a crime and a tragedy. But the only reason anyone in the West (or the US) cares about this, is because of Khashoggi's relationship with the Washington Post, and by extension, the Washington Post's position on the Trump presidency.  

As we all know, Trump and the MSM are at war. Khashoggi's connection to the Washington Post allows the media to *Americanize* Khashoggi, and to characterize the killing as an attack on a ""basically-American"" journalist.

It's amusing to see all the fake news media terrorists across all spectra in the West having orgasm for 2 months now trying to make their traitorous dhimmi asses worth their shekel in fencing for their puppet master & terror financier 'Dopey Prince' Al-Waleed bin Talal as the loser in the usual Saudi royalty's blood sport.

Khashoggi drama is like the Good Fellas and God Father 2 combined in one, but scripted in Arabic, and directed Muslim style.

Just as there is no honor among thieves, there is no trust among Muslim terrorists or Muslim terror financiers, as in this case.

In short, the whole Khashoggi brouhaha is essentially gang violence, Middle Eastern style. There is absolutely nothing special about it, as these kinds of things routinely happen there, except this time, it happened after one of the actors was employed by US establishment Washington Post. That's the only reason. That's also why even MBS was surprised by the strong reaction from the Western fake news media, funded by his opponents. In short, current Saudi Prince (Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud aka MBS) rifts apart with other Saudi Princes (led by Al-Waleed bin Talal) who support Muslim Brotherhood terrorists. Qatar sides with the latter, and it is funding all the fake news media terrorists in the West, hence the non-stop propaganda trying to incite American public opinion to oust current Prince MBS.

\*\*Again, there is absolutely no good guy here\*\*.

And yes, Khashoggi was a Muslim Brotherhood terrorist [http://archive.is/NKz0D](http://archive.is/NKz0D). In fact, that's why he was killed. He falsely believed he was safe in terror haven Turkey (which also trades oil with ISIS), which has fast become the traditional hideout for Muslim Brotherhood terrorists after Sisi overthrew Morsi, Muslim Brotherhood terrorist leader, out of Egypt.

Here was the lovely Muslim Brotherhood terrorist Khashoggi's message to America:

Dear USA, Your 9/11 is our 24/7. Sincerely, Palestine.

"I'm of the opinion that we should still protect our kids from violent and explicit content, but adults should be shown the reality of violence and death.

A single kick to the face broke one of my coworker's cheek bones, nearly shattered his eye socket, and his face looked like someone swung a baseball bat at him. Just one kick.    
    
Bullets don't hit people and cause holes. They explode the body violently. Take a round through the wrist from a 7.62 and your wrist will more than likely snap off from the damage. Take a round in the head and you're missing half your head.    
    
Likewise, most people have no idea what it actually sounds like when somebody gets their head sawed off. It wasn't normal screaming, like you'd expect a person to do when they're scared.

The guy was a shit-disturber, masquerading as a journalist, on the payroll of a CIA contractor (Bezos' Amazon contract / ownership of WaPo).

"Young millennials also won't understand that the corporate media - the same outlets they worship today - were banging the drum beats for war with Iraq over WMDs. Just like they have made it socially unacceptable to support President Trump, they made it socially unacceptable to oppose the Iraq War. When both the Democrat and Republican establishment are on the same page, calling for destructive, chaos-inducing moves, as they did in Iraq, as they did in Syria, as they are doing now with Saudi Arabia, your Spidey sense should be going off.

Saudi Arabia is also playing a strong role in helping America fight Iran's attempts at nuclear destruction of Israel and the United States. 

If all this gets thrown out, what happens next? A corrupt, radical Islamist becomes the new head of SA? Russia and/or China partner with the Saudis militarily? Iran becomes stronger on the international stage? There is an attempt here to force enormous chaos back into the region by driving a wedge between Trump's alliance to defeat Islamic terror. And who would that chaos benefit? Hard-working, tax-paying Americans? Peaceful Arab citizens in these countries? The Jews in Israel? Of course not!

"""The infant in his arms is a nice touch. This man should be removed from office immediately, no questions asked‚Ä¶placed upon administrative leave and then brought to bear for his statement.

The mindset is the danger: this is not the exception among politicians, but the norm. In these ‚Äúneo-feudal‚Äù times, you the citizen are expected to wear your ‚Äúuniform,‚Äù the tan (called ‚Äúkhakis‚Äù erroneously‚Ä¶a fabric composition substituted for a ‚Äúcolor‚Äù) pants, and the red shirt of Target or the navy blue shirt of Wal-Mart. Wear them, and the little name tag, and give half of what you make to the government‚Ä¶and allow them to craft your lives‚Ä¶as you obey.

Once again, the ‚ÄúBenjamin Martin‚Äù character in ‚ÄúThe Patriot‚Äù portrayed by Mel Gibson‚Ä¶that character‚Äôs lines were correct:

‚ÄúAn elected legislature can trample a man‚Äôs rights as easily as a king.‚Äù

They are coming for the guns. They are marching forward with their legislation, to provide ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù for their actions ‚Äúunder the color of law.‚Äù Their doorkickers are ‚Äúass-kickers,‚Äù in good shape and sharp reflexes with good mental acumen. They are ‚Äúpsychologically protected‚Äù to allow them to act with full force without restraint: protected with direct deposit of their check, protected with life insurance, and protected with healthcare for their families‚Ä¶all of their basics taken care of, plus a badge: they‚Äôre covered, when they come for the citizens.

The last step for a full-blown tyranny before the actual collapse (political, military, economic, or a combination thereof) is evident in the tyrannical measures and inflictions they foster against their own populace. These two examples cited here? They are no longer the exceptions. They are the norm, the normative behavior of a police state‚Ä¶a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù socialist society that is just a tiptoe away from a full-blown dictatorship, complete with death camps and firing squads without trials. To deny such a thing is a form of intentional blindness toward the current events, and the recurring theme of the history of man. We are seeing it unfold, and when it opens completely, it will not be a flower, but a hydra that will devour any of those who are unprepared for the long and protracted struggle to come and who are unprepared to show resolve and reclaim the rights earned for us by the Founding Fathers of the United States.""",klmd,ea8t9nz,The_Donald

"Scandal free presidency!

Please ignore:
‚Ä¢ $6 trillion in new national debt under Obama‚Ä¶after he promised to decrease the deficit.
‚Ä¢ Obamacare ‚Äî A massive and incredibly convoluted bill which exponentially increases the federal government‚Äôs control over our personal lives‚Ä¶which neither Obama nor a single Democrat even read before passing.
‚Ä¢ In both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, the Obama campaign purposely disabled the credit card verification system for its Web site donations, allowing anyone from any foreign country to donate with no limit and no proof of identity; in both elections it was demonstrated that people overseas and people with obviously false identities were able to donate to Obama campaign, in direct violation of several laws. To this day it is not known what percentage of Obama‚Äôs campaign funds are illegally obtained, since there is no documentation.
‚Ä¢ Billions of taxpayer dollars gambled on ‚Äúgreen‚Äù companies like Solyndra, NextEra, Ener1, Solar Trust and many others ‚Äî all of which went bankrupt.
‚Ä¢ An intentional refusal to enforce federal immigration laws.
‚Ä¢ Operation Fast & Furious ‚Äî a government-sponsored illegal gun-running scheme designed to purposely go awry so as to induce public outcry for gun control.
‚Ä¢ Spent 20 years listening to a racist anti-American pastor (Rev. Jeremiah Wright), whom Obama described as a mentor. On March 18, 2008, Obama gave a speech in which he said ‚ÄúI could no more disown Jeremiah Wright than I could disown my own grandmother‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ Increased the percentage of Americans dependent on food stamps to unprecedented levels (over 15% of the nation‚Äôs population).
‚Ä¢ Militarily intervened in Libya in 2011 without the Congressional approval required by the War Powers Act ‚Äî  an impeachable offense.
‚Ä¢ Before he entered politics, Obama worked as a lawyer suing banks in landmark cases, forcing them to give home loans to unqualified minority borrowers ‚Äî a practice now understood as one of the primary initial causes of the eventual housing bubble and market collapse.
‚Ä¢ Handed out over 1,200 waivers to politically connected donors exempting them from the onerous requirements of Obamacare.
‚Ä¢ Greatly expanding the number of unaccountable ‚Äúczars,‚Äù which essentially amounts to unilaterally adding new federal departments with no congressional oversight ‚Äî leading to a true ‚Äúbureaucracy‚Äù in the original sense.
‚Ä¢ Using taxpayer dollars to bail out the private pension funds of autoworkers‚Äô unions at GM & Chrysler.
‚Ä¢ Illegally ending the welfare-to-work requirements passed by Congress.
‚Ä¢ Doling out $800 billion in stimulus cash for ‚Äúshovel-ready‚Äù jobs that didn‚Äôt exist ‚Äî the money just evaporated with no measurable economic benefit.
‚Ä¢ Alienating and isolating Israel.
‚Ä¢ Apologizing to Islamists and terrorists for offending them.
‚Ä¢ For the first time in history America‚Äôs credit rating was downgraded, due to his poor economic policies.
‚Ä¢ Stopped American oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, allowing other nations with worse environmental records to drill instead ‚Äî thereby managing to both weaken our economy and damage the environment simultaneously.
‚Ä¢ Proposed in 2008 to intentionally bankrupt the coal industry.
‚Ä¢ Pretends to be concerned about skyrocketing energy prices, when in fact he vowed to increase them on purpose (so as to make alternative energy schemes more competitive.)
‚Ä¢ During the 2008 campaign, Obama repeatedly promised that if he was elected ‚ÄúNo family making less than $250,000 will see any form of tax increase.‚Äù This promise was broken over and over again.
‚Ä¢ In 2008 Obama vowed if elected to increase security along the U.S.-Mexican border ‚Äî and then in 2010 stopped construction of a ‚Äúvirtual fence‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ Cash for Clunkers, which doled out taxpayer money to anyone who wanted to replace their old cars, but which mostly only ended up subsidizing the purchase of foreign-made cars by people who could have afforded them on their own anyway; meanwhile, the traded-in cars were all destroyed, creating a shortage and thereby increasing the cost of used cars, hurting the pocketbooks of poor people.
‚Ä¢ Violated the U.S. Constitution by authorizing assassinations and drone strikes to kill American citizens abroad without due process.
‚Ä¢ Was caught on a ‚Äúhot mike‚Äù promising the President of Russia that he would cave in to their demands for a weaker missile shield ‚Äî after he was re-elected and no longer had to keep up the pretense that he sought to defend America.
‚Ä¢ Appointed Van Jones, a former avowed communist who supported a ‚Äú9/11 Truth‚Äù petition, to be ‚ÄúGreen Jobs Czar.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Appointed Anita Dunn, who said Chairman Mao was her ‚Äúfavorite philosopher,‚Äù to be White House Communications Director.
‚Ä¢ Appointed Steven Chu, who openly advocated an artificial increase in gasoline prices to $10/gallon (and similar increases in other energy prices) to be Secretary of Energy.
‚Ä¢ Appointed Kevin Jennings, who led a group that promoted X-rated ‚Äúsex-positive‚Äù textbooks for 13-year-olds, instructed teenagers at a conference how to perform ‚Äúfisting‚Äù (anal penetration by fists), who refused to report instances of statutory rape, and who expressed admiration for a member of NAMBLA, to be America‚Äôs ‚ÄúSafe School‚Äôs Czar.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ When states voted to enforce the federal immigration laws which the federal government refused to enforced, Obama sued to stop them.
‚Ä¢ Blocked continued construction of the Keystone Pipeline, thereby intentionally reducing energy resources for the US and forcing Canada to sell more of its oil to China.
‚Ä¢ Repeatedly changed his position on gay marriage over the years, depending on what was politically expedient at the moment or which audience he was addressing.
‚Ä¢ Before he was president, Obama staunchly opposed raising the national debt limit ‚Äî but once elected, he insisted that it be raised.
‚Ä¢ When giving a 2009 speech in France that he must have assumed Americans would never hear, he described the United States as ‚Äúarrogant‚Äù and ‚Äúdismissive‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ Obama sued states to prevent voter ID laws.
‚Ä¢ Instructed Attorney General Eric Holder to stonewall any investigation into the voter intimidation case against the New Black Panthers.
‚Ä¢ Promised in 2008 that once elected he would officially recognize the Armenian Genocide; never did when pressed.
‚Ä¢ Vowed to end the influence of lobbyists in Washington, but under Obama‚Äôs watch their influence increased.
‚Ä¢ When he was first running for President, Obama promised, ‚ÄúI will not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House website for five days.‚Äù He broke that promise with almost every bill signed since.
‚Ä¢ Aided and abetted the ‚ÄúArab Spring‚Äù which deposed existing secular governments across North Africa, leading to a regional power vacuum which was filled by hardline Islamists.

‚Ä¢ Established an extra-Constitutional top secret ‚Äúkill list‚Äù of people (including Americans) Obama claims the right to kill on sight, and then bragged about it publicly.

‚Ä¢ More than once Obama made so-called ‚Äúrecess appointments‚Äù when the Senate was not actually in recess, which directly violates Constitutional rules about how appointments must be made; in each case it was his way of getting his political allies into certain key positions without them being vetted or approved by the Senate, as required.

‚Ä¢ Since 2008 the Los Angeles Times has been in possession of a videotape showing Obama honoring and praising anti-Western anti-Israel academic Edward Said, but they have steadfastly refused to release it to this day, for no discernible reason other than their belief it would damage Obama‚Äôs reputation.

**75% of the members of the caravan give the image of being aggressive people: Municipal Police**

TIJUANA, Baja California(GH)

Seventy-five percent of the members of the migrant caravan give the image of being aggressive people, said Municipal Police Director Mario Mart√≠nez Mart√≠nez.

This morning, four men were secured by Municipal Police officers when they were singled out as presumed responsible for smoking marijuana inside the shelter located in the Benito Juarez Sports Complex.

In his supervisory tour, Mario Mart√≠nez Mart√≠nez assured that Tijuana does not have the capacity to receive so many migrants; until yesterday, the number of Central Americans in Tijuana reached more than 4,000.

""As director of the Municipal Police I ask for the conscience of the federal authorities, I do not understand why they are allowing so many people to enter the city of Tijuana, we are going to get out of control, it is not possible that this is happening in the city, we are doing what is possible because we do not get out of control,"" he said.

The director added that, according to what he has appreciated since the arrival of the first group of the caravan, most of the members are conflictive people.

""They are tough people, 75% are seeing their characteristics that are not ordinary people, the other ladies, children, parents, the other 75% I'm seeing them that way,"" he said.

Since the arrival of Central American migrants until yesterday, 90 arrests were recorded, however, said Mart√≠nez, if more people continue to arrive, it will be more difficult to maintain order.

""There can be violence, fortunately, we have been able to control this situation **but this problem can be out of phase; most, all the people we have arrested, the majority are drug users, you enter the shelter and you feel a characteristic smell of marijuana,"" **he said.

"Many voters who swung for Trump in 2016 didn't swing for the GOP in 2018.  I live in West Virginia where almost  25% of the voters who backed Trump in 2016 did not vote for the WV GOP Senate candidate despite Trump's help with his campaign. The GOP still has much work to do to win the trust of these Trump swing voters who include union workers and blue dog and blue collar Dems/Indies. I know a couple of construction workers here in WV who are hardcore Trump supporters that won't vote for Republicans.

In 2016, WV supported both Trump and the Dem. candidate for governor ( who then switched his party, angering many Dems here). You look at Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc, and you can see similar voter sentiment. For example, in 2018 Michigan and Wisconsin replaced their Republican governors with Democratic governors and both states re-elected Democratic senators. Pennsylvania re-elected Dems for both governor and senator and Ohio re-elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate. The left confuses this as an erosion of support for Trump but they are dead wrong. This is just the status quo in GOP vs DNC contests. President Trump is the wild card in the deck that the Dems can't understand.

The reality that the liberal pundits will not allow themselves to believe is that these Dem. and Indep. Trump swing voters continue to be strong supporters of Trump and their numbers are growing due to the Dem. party's resistance to the agenda they voted for.  I believe we will see support in the rust belt states grow  as the Dems continue to swing left and obstruct Trump's agenda. Add the increased support among Blacks and Latinos and you have a recipe for an electoral college blowout in 2020 with down-ticket GOP candidates again benefitting from Trump's name at the top of the ticket.",semlaw,ea78s6b,The_Donald

"No, they said no felony charges. Submitted to the City Attorney for consideration of misdemeanor charges.

The way it works under CA law is depending on the severity of the incident, the police will either arrest for domestic violence under PC 273.5(a) (visible injuries = felony charges) or PC 243(e)(1) (any battery on romantic partner of any kind). The DA then can decline charges, accept them, or reduce them.

In this case it appears there was enough probable cause to arrest for the felony section, and the police always charge high and let the DA knock it down. It also appears the DA looked at the police reports and decided the severity did not rise to a felony. The victim is desirous of prosecution and there may eventually be a misdemeanor filing,  which would likely be appropriate in this case.

The victim may not have been badly injured, and even misdemeanor domestic violence convictions carry considerable consequences. Plus, a temporary restraining order has been issued and a permanent one will likely be as well.

It really strains your theory to say that Gore wouldn't have had to be popular to seize power.  We saw how 9/11 played out.  Bush needed that 90% approval rating to do everything he did.

**Bernie Sanders had popular support and won the most votes, and yet the Democrats did not let him have power.  The Clintons seized power. Hillary Clinton did not have popular support, and she seized power from Bernie Sanders.** Gore did not have popular support, and he would not have needed popular support to seize power.  He would have supported the enemy, and not had popular rupport, and would still have seized power, becasue that is what the Democrats did in 2000 and in 2016.  **The Democrats are corrupt, they support our enemies, Gore would have done badly, and they would never have given power back to the people because the Democrats do not need the people.

I also gave links to prove my point that **I believe Al Gore would have attempted to seize power, as based upon the proof that the DNC has used illegal tactics to seize power without popular support, as proven by Hillary Clinton's Power Grab of Bernie Sander's Democratic nomination.** and you should give me sources ro support your statement too!!

"**Actually, the book was a allegorical exhortation against the power of power to corrupt**.  Huey Long was very powerful in Louisiana, and the **Democrat Machine** which helped him rise to power was considered to be a credible threat to Roosevelt.  Rather than a ""crazy fantasy"" at the time ""It Can't Happen Here"" was considered to be quite plausible and even possible.

"Actually, Long was the Democratic machine.  But, that doesn't really matter.  It was an allegory about fascism and Naziism.  Sinclair Lewis wanted to warn people about the Nazis, so he picked Long because he saw similarities in Long's populist, nationalist rhetoric.  If you read the book, Lewis even gave Long his own Goebbels.  It definitely wasn't a warning against the Democratic Party.  Just wasn't.  FDR, who was the one who actually ran the Democratic machine, was a positive figure in the book.",T2r0u2m0p2020,ea7mz9m,The_Donald

"There's a great video that doodles over C.S lewis on why chivalry is necessary (someone shared it here a while ago). it's worth a watch, but it essentially says that this cycle of creation and destruction was attenuated by the emergence of chivalry in the Middle Ages (think Lancelot), where now strong men weren't just brutal in war to defend their people but also meek and kind and gentlemen, so they could rule and defend with stability. Before that, our heroes like Achilles were absolute savages who would slaughter slaves when bored. Basically, the modern Leftists destruction of Chivalry is going to return us to this ancient cycle of strong ruthless leaders intertwined with weak cucks. Because if man isn't taught to be both 100% ruthless when necessary and 100% kind and meek when called for, then he'll just fall into his natural instinct of either being a savage or being a cuck

"Pedes, if you really want to understand the civilization cycle I recommend reading the following, in order:

(The what): *""The Fate of Empire and Search for Survival"" by Sir John Glubb.* Short essay freely available for download. If you are lazy, skip to summary at end but you should read it.

&#x200B;

(The why) ""Biohistory: Decline and fall of the West"" by Jim Penman. This book will forever alter how you view history and contemporary events by presenting a long overdue consideration of biology, specifically **epigenetics** and its incredibly influential role on shaping temperament. Herein lays the answers why the observed cyclical nature of civilization exists and even down the common phenomena of children or grandchildren totally squandering the wealth of a self-made businessmen. Here also lays the science why traditional child-rearing is so good and the likewise the important role e.g. Christianity played in our civilization.

&#x200B;

Extra credit: ""The Fate of Empires: Being an Inquiry into the Stability of Civilization"" by John Hubbard and ""Decline of the West: Form and Actuality"" by Oswald Spengler are also highly recommended albeit they are quite challenging reads.

&#x200B;

Group psychology: ""The Crowd"" and ""Psychology of Revolution"" by Gustave le Bon (father of crowd psychology) and ""Propaganda"" by Edward Bernays (nephew of Freud). These two figures you have never heard of are easily in the top 100 influencers of the past 150 years.

"It's evolution. Put difficult conditions in front of a population and only the strong will reproduce as the weak will be unable to survive in those conditions.

Then you have that population that survives granted access to a lot of resources since the herd has been thinned and the few that are left are highly capable.

But then food is easy to get so there is no longer an evolutionary pressure selecting for highly effective people. In fact, it selects whoever can exploit the good times to excess the fastest, so liberals.

Then there are too many organisms for the food supply again and it becomes competitive and you end up with lazy weaklings dying and the strong and effective thriving.

Humans are supposed to be smart enough to understand this natural pendulum not to ignore it, but to keep it in balance so there are no massive swings. The bigger the swinging arc the greater the tragedy.

Of course instead we apply our intelligence into figuring out how to make the pendulum swing as much as fucking possible ie let's try communism again.",Aro2220,ea5zljz,The_Donald

Interesting you brought this up because this is something I've thought about many times before and elates to something my dad always mentions.

He was raised on a farm and worked picking fruit, worked in canning sheds,lifting bails of hay, etc. Yeah, sounds like a white privilege I know. Anyways, this picture struck a chord of truth that people have to make or find problems to cause strife for everyone else when they should be enjoying what we have built. It's funny how much of these cuck ideas fly out the door when dealing with a natural disaster or any real hardship. Yes, sometimes I think we(as in liberals or people that never had a manual labor job in their youth) have too much or just don't know how to deal with day to day living when things are going good.

I find it surprising when people are overweight, drinking, smoking, have a car, have a place to live, etc yet those items may not be the best so they have to complain about inequality. Healthcare as a right is a completely foreign idea to me. These people don't know true hardship when all they have to do is look outside the U.S. to find out what being truly poor means such as dirt floors, one set of clothes, living in a hut, no clean water, etc.

Expand too much, and the military will be spread too thin, which can lead to things like trade routes being compromised, people beginning to rebel as the country can't protect them properly, and then a whole downwards spiral.

Rome couldn't continue expanding forever, because internal problems are going to start popping up no matter what you do. The Romans often had to deal with uprisings all through their expansion, which they had to deal with first, before they began to lose what they earned, either in territory or wealth. As they grew larger and larger, more and more uprisings started occurring, the corruption got worse, and Romans lost their cause.

"There's a great video that doodles over C.S lewis on why chivalry is necessary (someone shared it here a while ago). it's worth a watch, but it essentially says that this cycle of creation and destruction was attenuated by the emergence of chivalry in the Middle Ages (think Lancelot), where now strong men weren't just brutal in war to defend their people but also meek and kind and gentlemen, so they could rule and defend with stability. Before that, our heroes like Achilles were absolute savages who would slaughter slaves when bored. Basically, the modern Leftists destruction of Chivalry is going to return us to this ancient cycle of strong ruthless leaders intertwined with weak cucks. Because if man isn't taught to be both 100% ruthless when necessary and 100% kind and meek when called for, then he'll just fall into his natural instinct of either being a savage or being a cuck

"Pedes, if you really want to understand the civilization cycle I recommend reading the following, in order:

(The what): *""The Fate of Empire and Search for Survival"" by Sir John Glubb.* Short essay freely available for download. If you are lazy, skip to summary at end but you should read it.

&#x200B;

(The why) ""Biohistory: Decline and fall of the West"" by Jim Penman. This book will forever alter how you view history and contemporary events by presenting a long overdue consideration of biology, specifically **epigenetics** and its incredibly influential role on shaping temperament. Herein lays the answers why the observed cyclical nature of civilization exists and even down the common phenomena of children or grandchildren totally squandering the wealth of a self-made businessmen. Here also lays the science why traditional child-rearing is so good and the likewise the important role e.g. Christianity played in our civilization.

&#x200B;

Extra credit: ""The Fate of Empires: Being an Inquiry into the Stability of Civilization"" by John Hubbard and ""Decline of the West: Form and Actuality"" by Oswald Spengler are also highly recommended albeit they are quite challenging reads.

&#x200B;

Group psychology: ""The Crowd"" and ""Psychology of Revolution"" by Gustave le Bon (father of crowd psychology) and ""Propaganda"" by Edward Bernays (nephew of Freud). These two figures you have never heard of are easily in the top 100 influencers of the past 150 years.

"It's evolution. Put difficult conditions in front of a population and only the strong will reproduce as the weak will be unable to survive in those conditions.

Then you have that population that survives granted access to a lot of resources since the herd has been thinned and the few that are left are highly capable.

But then food is easy to get so there is no longer an evolutionary pressure selecting for highly effective people. In fact, it selects whoever can exploit the good times to excess the fastest, so liberals.

Then there are too many organisms for the food supply again and it becomes competitive and you end up with lazy weaklings dying and the strong and effective thriving.

Humans are supposed to be smart enough to understand this natural pendulum not to ignore it, but to keep it in balance so there are no massive swings. The bigger the swinging arc the greater the tragedy.

Interesting you brought this up because this is something I've thought about many times before and elates to something my dad always mentions. He is 85 now and when he was growing up, he said they worked sunup to sundown and were too tired to cause problems. He was raised on a farm and worked picking fruit, worked in canning sheds,lifting bails of hay, etc. Yeah, sounds like a white privilege I know. Anyways, this picture struck a chord of truth that people have to make or find problems to cause strife for everyone else when they should be enjoying what we have built. It's funny how much of these cuck ideas fly out the door when dealing with a natural disaster or any real hardship. Yes, sometimes I think we(as in liberals or people that never had a manual labor job in their youth) have too much or just don't know how to deal with day to day living when things are going good.

I find it surprising when people are overweight, drinking, smoking, have a car, have a place to live, etc yet those items may not be the best so they have to complain about inequality. Healthcare as a right is a completely foreign idea to me. These people don't know true hardship when all they have to do is look outside the U.S. to find out what being truly poor means such as dirt floors, one set of clothes, living in a hut, no clean water, etc. 

We couldn't have it better but for some strange reason, half the country wants to destroy what we built.",Kinestron,ea6hh35,The_Donald

"C.S. Lewis was a hardcore atheist (losing his mother and wife to illness), until his close friend and colleague, Prof. J.R.R. Tolkien helped him return to the Christianity of his youth.  This lead to the creation of Narnia and an enormous line of books on Christian apologetics. (btw Tolkien did not approve of Narnia's lack of subtlety in using Christian symbolism and themes).

I find the impact of his renewed Christian faith extremely important on his viewpoint:

*""Since it is so likely that (children) will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherwise, you are making their destiny not brighter but darker.""*

*""Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.""*

Rome couldn't continue expanding forever, because internal problems are going to start popping up no matter what you do. The Romans often had to deal with uprisings all through their expansion, which they had to deal with first, before they began to lose what they earned, either in territory or wealth. As they grew larger and larger, more and more uprisings started occurring, the corruption got worse, and Romans lost their cause.

">Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia in late 2017, the same time that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman detained Khashoggi‚Äôs patron Prince Alwaleed and other royal and non-royal oligarchs at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton on allegations of corruption. Khashoggi soon was writing occasional columns for the Washington Post. Now that his faction of the royal family was on the outs, he had undergone an epiphany. He had discovered the desirability of respect for human rights, and even democracy! In his Post articles he waged a persistent campaign of criticism of the crown prince.  
>  
>Was the new Khashoggi a lonely, idealistic individual or the instrument of Saudi factions in opposition to the ascendant crown prince? Common sense would suggest there‚Äôs greater probability in the latter thesis.  
>  
>  
>  
> Khashoggi, and whoever were his masters in the campaign opposing Prince Mohammed bin Salman, were in a transactional relationship with the Washington Post. They used the Post to undermine their rival and elevate their status. The Post in turn used Khashoggi for its ends of virtue-signaling and accumulating the sort of prestige and power it values. The Post and Team Khashoggi were cooperating, consciously and I daresay cynically, in influence operations for their mutual benefit.  
>  
>  
>  
>Big Media‚Äôs constant description of Khashoggi as having been a mere ‚Äújournalist‚Äù is a huge and consequential deception. It‚Äôs not clear exactly for whom or for what powers and interests Khashoggi was working when he wrote his *Washington Post* columns, but anyone who understands how the world operates should have a high degree of confidence in saying that he was never a journalist in the sense that word is understood in the free nations of the West.  
>

>The *Washington Post,* which has a direct pipeline to the CIA that bypasses the White House, knows this all too well.

Since it must always prove beyond human power to raise the inferior mass to a superior stratum, apostles of equality must ever be inferiors seeking to reduce their betters to their level.

Opiate withdrawals are awful, I never want to experience that ever again in my life. It's  a tough situation, because you have to believe the patient if they say they are in pain. There are signs to know if they are drug seeking but the smart ones can find ways around it. 

Either way the epidemic is real, but I don't think legalizing opium dens is the solution. ",Firefly_07,ea7cmv8,The_Donald
"I don‚Äôt think they could ever beat us through military, but I definitely think they have spies and subverts throughout our country trying to turn us pinko.

China could always blow up before that happens, but that could mean war too. Who knows. I went ahead and picked up a full set of Chinese language discs. Haven‚Äôt really gotten around to it though

It‚Äôs pretty much all mandarin now, they have banned most of the dialects in schools. I‚Äôd bet most Chinese dialects won‚Äôt be around in 50 years outside of mandarin",trump420noscope,ea6sjiv,The_Donald
"You already do! The epidemic is costing us billions a year. It‚Äôs not even about junkies prolonging their life style, it‚Äôs about stopping opioid overdoses. The goal of safe injection sites is to administer naloxone to prevent death, and provide access to addiction management resources to prevent relapse. ",by-all-accounts,ea6drw2,The_Donald
Just let people grow poppies and harvest their own opium. Cut out the middle men.,Allah_es_Grande,ea6iopc,The_Donald
"Regulation takes money. You still foot the bill. I agree that we need a complete overhaul here, but what about in the meantime? Rates of opioid deaths are rising at a truly terrifying rate, and it‚Äôs not just fentanyl. Injection sites are a stop gap, a temporary measure. 


You don‚Äôt ‚Äúallow users to get clean‚Äù, you have to treat the resulting neurotransmitter dysregulation.  That costs money these people don‚Äôt have. That doesn‚Äôt even cover addiction and pain management research costs. Trump‚Äôs HHS realizes this and already approved spending a billion on it...
",by-all-accounts,ea6fn0z,The_Donald
"Safe dope locations are a form of outreach. Rehab is great, and absolutely needed, same with community outreach. BUT there‚Äôs a gap there. How do you handle the all too common relapse? Safe injection sites are one solution. They provide clean needles, naloxone for OD reversal, and resources to help prevent future relapse. It‚Äôs tool to mitigate negative outcomes and hopefully aid in recovery. That saves us money in the long term. 


Also dependency and addiction are two different things. Dependency refers to the physical dependence, while addiction refers to the ‚Äúneed‚Äù. That need comes from a fundamental change in brain function. A rewiring so to speak. 


As for whether I‚Äôd live next to a bunch of junkies or a church going family...all to often they are one and the same. Going to church doesn‚Äôt prevent opioid abuse. Sense of community, faith and not condoning illegal behaviors all can help prevent drug use in some cases, but perscription opiates don‚Äôt seem to be as effected by that...here‚Äôs Christian research saying so: http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12501

What happens when someone in your hypothetical Christian family runs out of their oxy scrip? Hopefully rehab and support but not always. Heroin is readily available and hits those same receptors. It may help if you view ‚Äújunkies‚Äù as a stage of addiction. It‚Äôs a progressed form of the same brain dysfunctions. It‚Äôs like being sad sometimes vs suffering from major depressive disorder. 

The pills you get from a doctor are the real gateway drug. That‚Äôs why we have an opioid epidemic.

"> I don‚Äôt think they could ever beat us through military, but I definitely think they have spies and subverts throughout our country trying to turn us pinko.

As of today they definitely couldn't, even a balkanized America would be tough to actually invade because of the 2A, the natural choke points in our terrain and the hunter culture so many partake in.

Their only hope in the near future is that we defeat ourselves via demographics and infighting or collapse as a whole under big gov/welfare state/corruption.

Their best bet is to continue buying land like they are in Canada and Western USA to gain traction in the economy itself, slowly taking over economically and, as you said, subverting from there.",ThrowAway8295425,ea6ts8v,The_Donald

"So by-all-accounts, safe injection sites don‚Äôt ‚Äúallow users to get clean‚Äù?",NADSAQ_Trader,ea6fxjs,The_Donald
"That‚Äôs a step in the right direction but it doesn‚Äôt help cope with relapse as effectively.It isn‚Äôt about enabling it‚Äôs about mitigating further negative consequences.  Just because it‚Äôs dumbest thing you‚Äôve heard doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong. Opiate addiction doesn‚Äôt function like your caffeine addiction or even alcoholism. Opioid receptors are often referred to as reward centers. Opiates modify the way your brain works, it basically makes it nearly imppssible to stop the addiction alone. That‚Äôs the reason opiate relapse is far more common than stimulant relapse. 
",by-all-accounts,ea6yghi,The_Donald
"Not really, no. That‚Äôs not how addiction works. It‚Äôs akin to an open door policy, it gets the patients into an area where further steps can be taken. There‚Äôs something to be said of the reducing the stress level of users to prevent relapse but honestly haven‚Äôt dug very deep in the research there.

"I was a liberal in high school which was nearly 20 years ago. And we had a social justice reading group. We read tons of documents on corporate corruption in the government and how neocon defense contractors and government were working together to create wars overseas. We also saw the state of the poor in America. Including people jailed for victimless crimes like having marijuana. So we were against all of that. Of course I was just a kid so I didn‚Äôt have much more than being ‚Äúagainst‚Äù stuff. Now, nearly 20 years later with a lot of work experience I generally feel the same way. Unnecessary foreign wars are bad, and we should help make America a better place instead. Let‚Äôs have less crime and better jobs and schools in America. These were the same ideas that we had back then except with productive ideas not just reactive ‚Äúagainst‚Äù ideas. Nothing has changed for me. No corruption in government and help out America first before doing foreign bullshit that usually makes things worse anyway. Who are these modern day liberals? I don‚Äôt remember seeing any of these types of guys in our reading group. These were the mainstream kids. They were not punks back then when it actually made you a rebel to be punk.

""Domestic espionage sharing controversy of Five Eyes 

****In recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive domestic regulations on spying****. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of the advocacy group Liberty, claimed that the ****FVEY alliance increases the ability of member states to ""subcontract their dirty work"" to each other****.The former NSA contractor *Edward Snowden described the FVEY as a ""supra-national intelligence organisation that doesn't answer to the laws of its own countries""****



Trying to blame other countries for a American initiated and Obama,Clapper and Brennan ordered/authorized spying operation is exactly what they want.Five Eyes gives them all the authorization and deniability they need,the Five Eyes members are obligated to fulfill the requests from other members and particularly American which is the biggest member with the most Intelligence assets dedicated to it.

TIJUANA, Baja California(GH)

The 17-year-old Honduran man who had been admitted to the General Hospital of Tijuana (HGT) died due to a diagnosis of chemical pneumonia by bronchoaspiration and intoxication of illicit substances. 

Oscar Ginera Aparicio, head of the Tijuana Health Services Jurisdiction, said the complication of the Honduran migrant's health status was also due to a urinary tract infection.

The young Honduran had entered the HGT in the early morning of November 14; due to his serious state of health he presented brain death secondary to anoxoischemic encephalopathy and seven days later he died, the chief explained in a statement.

Ginera Aparicio explained that the patient was tested to determine their pathologies and their management, which confirmed the consumption of enervants and consequently severe neurological damage.


On the other hand, he stressed that the Health Jurisdiction has been present providing medical services to Central American migrants who are housed in the Unidad Deportiva Benito Juarez, where until yesterday afternoon they have provided 644 medical consultations.

Of those 420 have been for respiratory tract infections, 317 dental care, 12 pregnant women in follow-up, in addition, 294 bottles of folic acid were delivered, 427 deworming treatments and **2,474 condoms.**

He can't get disability because he hasn't had that MRI, but is too physically weak to move around so he can't work.  Ontario has zero private care so we can't do anything but pray he doesn't die.  It's utter bullshit.  ",TheManWhoPanders,ea6t5n6,The_Donald
"Supply and demand determine prices.  It's practically a natural law and healthcare is not exempt from it.  I've always felt that the healthcare cost problem in the United States is a supply problem.  It stems from multiple sources but what those sources have in common is they result in there being less healthcare available for healthcare consumers.

Hopefully needless to say, socializing doesn't make supply problems better.  It makes them worse.

During a Monday phone call for reporters, Homeland Security officials said about 6,000 Central American migrants have already reached the border at Tijuana, and between 8,500 and 10,500 are still trekking north in at least three separate caravans. San Diego‚Äôs San Ysidro Port of Entry can process only about 100 asylum seekers per day, so the thousands waiting and still traveling will have to be handled over a period of many months.

One official said the caravan is comprised of thousands of people who are ‚Äúmost likely not eligible for asylum.‚Äù He said most are older teenagers or adult males, not families and children as some in the media reported. ‚ÄúMany if not most are simple economic migrants seeking to be reunited with families [and thus] ineligible for asylum,‚Äù he said. The official further noted the presence of more than 500 criminals in the border crowds. ‚ÄúAll legal options are on the table and we have been negotiating with all our partners in central America with ways to deal with the caravan,"" the official said.",GLOMPFFH_IS_FINISHED,ea84wq1,The_Donald

And another big agreed on several reasons. Those people are the only reasons we even got a good film of they undid the massive screw ups George Lucas did.

George may of had some good ideas sure but he is not the master guy people make him out to be.

The prequels showed how leaving him 100% in charge produced horrible films. 

Of course George Lucas being like the rest of Hollywood took all the credit naturally with doing his utter best to downplay what they did.

Which on a side note if you look at the timelines and I might be wrong but the whole ""Oh Jedi can not marry"" thing brought in Attack of the Clones film came about from around that time George was divorcing his wife.

"Every time i hear about the passing of veterans, i think the poem called the final inspection.

The soldier stood and faced God,
Which must always come to pass.
He hoped his shoes were shining,
Just as brightly as his brass.

""Step forward now, you soldier,
How shall I deal with you?
Have you always turned the other cheek?
To my Church have you been true?""

The soldier squared his soldiers and said,
""No, Lord, I guess I ain't.
Because those of us who carry guns,
Can't always be a saint.

I've had to work most Sundays,
And at times my talk was tough.
And sometimes I've been violent,
Because the world is awfully rough.

But, I never took a penny,
That wasn't mine to keep...
Though I worked a lot of overtime,
When the bills just got too steep.

And I never passed a cry for help,
Though at times I shook with fear.
And sometimes, God, forgive me,
I've wept unmanly tears.

I know I don't deserve a place,
Among the people here.
They never wanted me around,
Except to calm their fears.

If you've a place for me here, Lord,
It needn't be so grand.
I never expected or had too much,
But if you don't, I'll understand.""

There was a silence all around the throne,
Where the saints had often trod.
As the soldier waited quietly,
For the judgement of his God.

""Step forward now, you soldier,
You've borne your burdens well.
Walk peacefully on Heaven's streets,
You've done your time in Hell.""

"Had to check a couple of sources to confirm but here is the short answer to your question.

Philip is not King because he was never heir to the throne of England. He merely became the Consort, or husband, of the sovereign Queen when they married.

Following their marriage he could still have been a styled King, known as a King Consort (takes the title but does not rule) but Parliament and the Crown realised that giving him the title of King Consort would be unpopular with the British people for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that he is a foreigner (German) and that might cause confusion as to who is sovereign.

From my own family history the British people still had a lot of hard feelings towards Germany following WWII and many believed the Royal family would lose standing with the people if a German appeared to be their sovereign leader.

At the end of the day this was a political decision rather than one based on historical precedence. The principle reason for not giving Philip the title of King is the same reason (foreigner) that Queen Victoria's husband, Albert, became Prince Consort rather than King Consort when they married.",oraclizer,ea6c9ur,The_Donald

"Congratulations!  Just curious, what country are you originally from?

As all my ancestry descends from Revolutionary War soldiers, with family here since the early 1700s and earlier (especially one Native American line), I'm one of the few who can say my ancestors never migrated to the United States. At that time, the land belonged to other countries/tribes. 

That said, it always amazes me when I hear of new U.S. citizens. You all have a way of reminding me not to take citizenship for granted. 

Some years ago I was helping at a Persian (mostly Iranian) church in Southern California. Many in the congregation were on their road to citizenship. I was awed, hearing of their struggles leaving their country to get to the U.S.  Many whose lives were at risk after rejecting Islam to become Christian, then having to flee. One young man had high college degree in agriculture in Iran, but all that was nothing to him now, as he struggled to learn English while working a low wage job in the big city. He said he would have made lots of money with his degree in Iran, but he wanted the religious freedom and opportunities of America. 

Everyone I met there was appreciative to be in the U.S. During that time, I attended their women's Bible group that met in different homes. The host for that week showed me her citizenship ""homework"" with all the material she had to memorize for test day. I couldn't believe all that history and other material she had to know. I told her it was a good thing I was born here: I doubt I'd be able to memorize all that!!",walls4america,ea5rfav,The_Donald

"Thanks a lot, fellow pede! I was born in El Salvador. My family and I came here legally before I was in elementary school, so it was easier for me to assimilate. I do remember it being difficult at first because of course English wasn't my first language, however, I never went to any ""special"" ESL class or anything of the sort. I was just thrown in the pool and left to swim or die (which is the way I believe it should be, as I was able to do it). I learned to speak English fluently and this is the only country I truly know. The older I got, the more I read and educated myself on how special and important the founding documents are and how amazing the founders were because there is no country that has our freedoms and rights. I have visited Europe and Mexico and Canada and coming from a on-the-brink of socialism shithole like El Salvador, I know without a shadow of a doubt that America is the greatest, most freest, most generous, absolute best country on earth and fuck anyone who disagrees. I grew up poor in the ghetto and I hated it, so I worked ever since I was 15 (sometimes two jobs at once), saved, sacrificed, kept good credit and now as a grown married family man, am a homeowner in a great neighborhood with good schools for my kids, I'm a business owner, have savings, great credit, stocks and assets, living the American dream and I don't take anything for granted.

"No, it wasn't. (Although I did happen to once visit a Living Stream Ministries home Bible Study group years later in another city.)

This one was, I guess you could say, an independent fellowship that met Sunday mornings in a section of a Baptist church that donated their space. My regular church was non-denominational but I found online that this Persian church needed ESL volunteers. In all, I stayed over a month in the area, besides commuting from Riverside County (where I was living at the time) to the San Fernando Valley, where this church was. 

Even the Persian church pastor was a relatively new citizen, within a decade. His story was that he was a young Muslim man studying to be a Mullah. From what I understand, that's an Islamic ""church"" leader. But then while visiting another country (I forgot where, maybe Switzerland?) some from YWAM invited him to a Christian concert. After accepting the Lord that night, he realized his life would be in danger after he returned to Iran. And his life was threatened when he returned. 

His parents and older siblings agreed it was safer for him to leave the country. So, after a while in Europe and learning English, he was able to get paperwork completed to come to the U.S.  He enrolled in a Bible college on the East Coast, got his pastor's license, U.S. citizenship, and married an American woman he met at college.

Faith is hammered and ridiculed on a daily basis, and I find myself constantly having to pray: ""Forgive them Father, for they know not what they do or what they say.""
Anyway, keep up your beautiful work and keep spreading His Word, so that others may feast upon It.  On this day we have so much to be truly grateful for, and in my own case I am living a miraculous gift of healing from Our Lord Jesus Christ.

Look at Michelles picture above.

Notice that the ring finger is longer than her index (first, next to thumb)

Did you know that that difference in length is not normal for a woman?

Womens hands have ring fingers that are smaller or equal length to their index.

Very very rarely does a woman have a ring finger larger than the index.

For comparison

Here  is a picture of Serana Williams. An African American Woman who is one  of the best athletes we got. Even he ring finger is at most the same  length as her index, not longer.

&#x200B;

Here is a picture of the late Joan Rivers. Notice the ring is smaller than the index.

&#x200B;

Same thing. Nicki Manaj hands, ring and index are almost equal length, but still if you look hard, slightly smaller.

&#x200B;

**Meanwhile Michelles ring finger is clearly bigger than the index by a wide margin**

Here  is a collection of articles and studies that show that mens ring  fingers are controlled by hormones and that the ring finger is almost  always longer than the index in MEN.

While Womens ring fingers are almost always SHORTER than the index

[http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2011/09/male-female-ring-finger-proportions-tied-to-sex-hormones-in-embryo-may-offer-health-insights.html](http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2011/09/male-female-ring-finger-proportions-tied-to-sex-hormones-in-embryo-may-offer-health-insights.html) More evidence that Testosterone or Estrogen IN THE WOMB determine finger length
4. [https://www.livescience.com/49883-finger-length-in-men.html](https://www.livescience.com/49883-finger-length-in-men.html) Bigger the ring finger, the more testosterone and the bigger the penis
5. [https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/men-longer-ring-finger-more-11711753](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/men-longer-ring-finger-more-11711753) More testosterone in the womb makes your ring finger longer and longer.

BOTTOM LINE: A longer ring finger is caused by extra testosterone exposure IN THE WOMB, normally seen in boys!

The CIA who's behind a lot of this is absolutely determined to attack Trump's mental health and that's why their mouthpiece Obama recently whined that Trump has ""mommy issues"". 

The best way forward for them to gain credibility, with suburbanites, as the reasonable people in the room is to distance themselves somewhat from the open extremists on their side.

But you lost me with Nike and Starbucks. I don't wear Nikes because I can buy a pair of shoes that are just as comfortable for a fraction of the price, in fact I can buy a pair of steel-toe workboots and a pair of comfortable walking shoes for less than the cost of a single pair of Nikes. It's been 10 years since I set foot inside a Starbucks, I can get a better tasting cup of coffee for less money at McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts, or virtually anywhere else.

It's not really a luxury or an inconvenience to avoid their products when there are lower priced alternatives that are equal or better quality.

"First, Happy thanksgiving friend.

Second, let me try to show you were I'm at.

I don't buy shoes on branding. Though I would argue Nikes, New Balances, etc are more comfortable than some cheaper shoes. However, when I go to a store and see a shoe that I like at the price I am willing to pay, if it happens to be Nike, I'm buying it. Or, perhaps it's something else. I am also very very limited to shoes sold in store because depending on brand I wear a 15 or 16 with a 4E width. So each brand only carries a few ""models"" in such a large sizes without custom ordering. Nike and New Balance tend to have the largest stock pile in my experience.

Again, I do not seek out Star bucks, in fact I prefer a local place that has better tasting and cheaper coffee. However, most people like going to the 'bucks. And that's where they want to meet and hang for a minute. It's hard to convince everyone Star bucks coffee is bad and corporate is bad and... no one wants to hear it. They just want to go to star bucks and get their venti frappe caramel super titty twister iced mocha coffee. If that's the price I pay to have a nice day with the friends or fam, I'll sip their burnt coffee and smile.

But, it really is an inconvenience in small towns where people want to be hip and trendy and buy into the corporate bs. I live in a southern town where my county has less people than most cities, let alone my city. While it does have some brands - they tend to carry what people think they want.. I.E Star Bucks, Tractor Supply, or whatever. There typically aren't many alternatives, and when they are, they're across town, or priced the same or more.

I don't go around town going ""Oh cant go to star bucks, or can't buy this nike I like..."" It would be endless if I boycotted every terrible company for political reasons. Let alone rude customer service or whatever.

Man, life is was too short, or long, depending on perspective to live like that. At least in my opinion. I have enough on my plate to worry about if my shoes are made by a company who supports a douche bag.

"Not really. The stringers on most of those stairs look to be about 6 inches apart in the center of the tread with nothing supporting the ends of the treads. Additionally, the treads are face-nailed with no attachment hardware (there are lots of pictures of these stairs online that show this clearly). If you're not going to support them on the edges, then they need to be supported by more than just face-nailing in the center. This might last for a little while if nobody ever walked on the outside edges of the stairs, but anytime someone does, those center stringers are basically a fulcrum that works to help pry those nails right out of the stringers. Additionally, the handrail posts were then anchored...directly on the outside edge of the stair treads. Anytime someone leans on the rail, especially if not standing directly in the middle of the tread with the anchored rail post, they will again be prying the tread nails up.

"These are senior citizens. Even small falls can be fatal. 

[From AgingCare](https://www.agingcare.com/articles/falls-prove-fatal-for-elderly-patient-149687.htm)  

>Depending on how a senior lands when they fall, they could experience anything from a broken hip to a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Fractured bones and soft tissue injuries are the most common injuries. Unfortunately for seniors, even minor trauma can require hospitalization, and many never regain the level of functionality and confidence they enjoyed before the incident.  
>  
>Advanced age, frailty and pre-existing medical conditions mean that older individuals are less likely to recover from their injuries. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Mississippi found that seniors older than 70 experienced a three-fold increase in their risk of death after a fall when compared with those 69 and younger. According to the CDC, trauma to the brain was the cause of death in 41% of fall fatalities among seniors in 2010. However, even with a less serious injury, like a broken bone, the course of treatment and prognosis are still complicated. Hip fractures often require surgical procedures involving sedation and further trauma‚Äîtwo things that can jeopardize an older person's life.  
>  
>Even if a senior survives the fall and subsequent medical care, a longer recovery time translates to a longer hospital stay. This leaves the elderly more vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, C. diff, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Matters can be complicated further if an infection is resistant to commonly used antibiotic drugs.

The screw probably has 20 different special clauses attached to it to ensure that the screw is strength tested, corrosion resistant, and temperature rated between - 20 to 200 degrees F.

I am not shitting you either. A big chuck of my time is spent arguing because a weld didn't meet spec or there is no tracking on the metal for a specific piece of stainless steel so it can't be used because we don't know if it meets a specific spec put out of the military.

"I find this answer to kinda be an appeal to authority.  Yes, these things are usually in the contract requirements put out by the military.  i.e. the army decides it wants a new helicopter for a specific role.  it lists a bunch of requirements the vehicle must meet.  Bell designs the 204. Army awards Bell the contract, renomenclatures it the UH-1.

But just because a thing is stipulated as a requirement in a contract does not mean it is not wasteful. Did the service ceiling *really* need to be 19,000ft? Or would 15 have been fine? Because these machines almost NEVER go up that high anyway. So could the engine specs have been drawn back some? so it stayed cooler? saw less extremes? etc. 

It's a want vs. needs things.  The army would require helicopters which could fly to the moon and back if they had their way, and one for every soldier. But that doesn't mean those requirements wouldn't be impractical 99.99999999% of the time.  And impractical is usually a synonym for wasteful.

The other waste areas my ACO buddies pointed out were shipping broken ship parts from the coast to the center of the USA, then back again, even though they all pointed out the job could be done on the coast and save money. However, they said it was due to jobs and keeping areas of the country employed in good paying jobs, I guess that is ok then. Overall, I am glad you commented on this, you are right!

"> ‚ÄúMr. [John] Huber with the Department of Justice and the FBI has been having an investigation ‚Äì at least part of his task was to look at the Clinton Foundation and what may or may not have happened as it relates to improper activity with that charitable foundation, so we‚Äôve set a hearing date for December the 5th,‚Äù he told Hill.TV during an interview on Wednesday.
> 
> Meadow‚Äôs said the committee plans to delve into a number of Republicans concerns surrounding the foundation, including whether any tax-exempt proceeds for personal gain and whether the Foundation complied with IRS laws.
> 
> Sessions appointed Huber last year to work in tandem with the Justice Department to look into conservative claims of misconduct at the FBI and review several issues surrounding the Clintons. This includes Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ties to a Russian nuclear agency and concerns about the Clinton Foundation.
> 
> Huber‚Äôs work has remained shrouded in mystery. The White House has released little information about Huber‚Äôs assignment other than Session‚Äôs address to Congress saying his appointed should address concerns raised by Republicans.
> 
> But Meadows said the committee thinks it‚Äôs time Huber gives an update to Congress about his findings, and expects him to be one of the witnesses at the hearing.
> 
> Meadows also added that his committee is also trying to secure testimonies from whistleblowers who could have more information about potential improprieties surrounding the Clinton Foundation.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just now starting to work with a couple of whistleblowers that would indicate that there is a great probability, a significant improper activity that‚Äôs happening in and around the Clinton Foundation,‚Äù he said.",My6thRedditusername,ea57828,The_Donald

Grant recipients must provide a nonfederal contribution of at least 25% of the annual grant disbursement each year or 33% of a grant renewal.

(Sec. 6) Interior must facilitate the establishment of relationships between grant recipients and educational institutions serving Native American communities.

"You're pretty much making my point, but not understanding it. Stereotypes come from unique physical or socially noticed traits commonly recognized as belonging to a specific group. If someone is going to make reference to any particular stereotype and expect it to be understood, it needs to make sense AND be recognizable (even if it's untrue). Having thin lips has never been common stereotype for **any** group. Having full lips has been a common stereotype for a specific group. To say you don't have white people lips means...what? You have Indian lips? Asian lips? Hispanic lips? Jewish lips? Arab lips? Albino lips? Pacific Islander lips? Likely none of these, because the only stereotype, that is general knowledge, involving lips is about black people. This chick is using acceptable racism against white people as a way to be racist (and fucking brainless), because she's mad someone called her ugly on the Internet. Gross. 

Your lips, white people's lips, black people's lips, any damned lips have nothing to do with this. This chick, is doing what I think might be an example of **actual** ""reverse racism"": taking a stereotype/trait/generalization that is commonly recognized as being about one particular race (real or perceived) and supporting that stereotype in a manner which promotes that one specific race, separating it from every other race, as a point of superiority.

"I‚Äôm pretty sure the point of the poem was to point out how calling blacks colored is less literal than calling whites colored.

It says ‚Äúwhen I am ‚Äòthis‚Äô I am black‚Äù multiple times followed by the same statements with for whites with corresponding colors.

This is implying that when whites are mad they literally (and metaphorically) turn red.

When blacks are mad they only metaphorically turn red, not literally.

I think you are getting something confused here by stating the entire poem is metaphors. It‚Äôs trying to point out how backwards it is to call black people colored when white people‚Äôs facial skin tone can literally change color with temperature and the like. (At least how it‚Äôs portrayed in the poem)

Edit: when you google search for this poem here is one of the top results http://dearblankpleaseblank.com/permalink.php?viewid=216204

So I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs about whites being racist because they are ‚Äúliterally colored‚Äù in the eyes of blacks.

Eventually they will cease all together.  I had to watch my social life in the meantime because I knew that if I went to a bar to drink I would cave and light up a cigarette, so I didn't go.

You will be amazed at how much better you feel and how much more clearly you can think.

**Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2017**

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to redesignate the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

CISA shall be headed by the Director of National Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security, and CISA's responsibilities include: leading cybersecurity and critical infrastructure security programs, operations, and associated policy; coordinating with non-federal and federal entities; and carrying out DHS's responsibilities concerning chemical facility antiterrorism standards.

CISA shall be composed of DHS components reorganized as: (1) the Cybersecurity Division, (2) the Infrastructure Security Division, and (3) the Emergency Communications Division (currently the Office of Emergency Communications). The agency must have a privacy officer to ensure compliance with federal laws.

(Sec. 3) The bill transfers within DHS the Office of Biometric Identity Management to the Directorate for Management, and it authorizes the transfer of the Federal Protective Service to any DHS component, directorate, or other office that DHS deems appropriate.

(Sec. 5) No additional funds are authorized to carry out this bill's requirements.

I wouldn't recommend you look at the response to this (and other similar articles) on other subreddits. You would be quite disappointed. It's a crazy world out there with lots of dumb sheep. ,TBLvl4,ea7nnsw,The_Donald

Yeah the feds are full of crap on many things. Like when they killed all those children at Waco. And CPS takes kids away for the suspected child abuse and puts them with child molesters and rapists every day because they have been give too much power. In a lot of places that's the plan all along. Cps should meet the same burden of proof that police must meet. But with them there is no presumption of innocence. You are guilty until you prove yourself innocent.,Berniegotbank,ea7vt26,The_Donald
