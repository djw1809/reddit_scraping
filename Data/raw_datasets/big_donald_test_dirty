♦(1) Create an investigation – Just by creating the investigation it is then used as a shield by any corrupt FBI/DOJ official who would find himself/herself under downstream congressional investigation.  Former officials being deposed/questioned by IG Horowitz or Congress could then say they are unable to answer those questions due to the ongoing special counsel investigation.  In this way Mueller provides cover for officials.

♦(2)  Use the investigation to keep any and all inquiry focused away from the corrupt DOJ and FBI activity that took place in 2016, 2016, 2017.  Keep the media narrative looking somewhere, anywhere, other than directly at the epicenter of the issues. In this way, Mueller provides distraction and talking points against the Trump administration.

♦(3) Use the investigation to suck-up, absorb, any damaging investigative material that might surface as a result of tangentially related inquiry.  Example: control the exposure of evidence against classified leak participants like SSCI Director of Security, James Wolfe. In this way Mueller provides cover for the institutions and the administrative state.",Sea_Still,e9n97kt,The_Donald

You will end up with mixed Cub Scouts then Girl Scouts separate from Boy Scouts underneath of the BSA umbrella. Basically BSA is going to swallow up and Rebrand the Girl Scouts minus the cookies. That's the number one complaint I saw on Reddit was parents loving the experience their boys got at scouts but not liking the experience their daughters get in the Girl Scouts.

Appreciate the honesty, sir soy.

Will you kindly condemn the drone strikes our previous president ordered for years? 

Perhaps the millions of Americans who fell into poverty during the same administration? 

I heard that Obama's administration did not project the economy ever turning around, but now it seems that, retroactively and against all facts, Obama did fix the economy. 

The facts just don't corroborate your testimony, Dr. Ford, and that is why you are wrong.

Kleptogamy is seen throughout the animal kingdom, but is most often seen in humans.  
>  
>Common examples of Kleptogamy among beta male humans include pretending to be homosexual in order to gain the trust of a female, or claiming to be a feminist in order to signal their submission to the female, and attempt to trick her into believing the male to be virtuous.

No i'm not going to omit '64 and '68 where Lyndon B. Johnson held huge Democratic sway over Texas, or Nixon (39.9) vs. Hubert Humphry (41.1) vs. George Wallace (19) which was an exceptionally close run contest as noted by as near a 40:40:20 split as you're going to get. I'd argue thats an indicator of policy and promise than of anything else.

[1972 - Nixon at 66.2% where only very extemities south west of San Antonio hit blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1972)

[1976 - Indeed i'm not omitting 76 or 78 Gubernatorial elections in Texas either, both of which have a heavy Blue sway right across Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1976)

[1980 - Has another comparatively close contest based on context of Reagan vs. Carter which again divides Texas, with San Antonio heavily voting for Reagan at upwards of 80%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1980)

[1984 - Reagan being in office for 4 years swings Texas heavily red, except for areas immediately south west of San Antonio and now south of Corpus Christi which itself barely clings to red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1984)

[1992 - Bush sr. vs. Is a Rapist Clinton, 1992. Another divisve race with voting patterns similar to the above with the clear trends being similar, with north/south red/blue divide, whilst centre/east fluctuates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1992)

[1996 - Dole vs. Infowars.com Clinton. Pattern consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1996)

[2000 - Bush Jr. vs. Manbearpig Nemesis. Heavy Republican favour, with centre/eastern areas of Texas much more heavily red. North/South divide still apparent - Note how all the cities remain Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2000)

[2004 - Bush jr. vs. Kerry. Texas remains consistent in pattern, however immediately north of Austin has narrowly swung blue, whilst Houston, San Antonio and Corpus Christi are significantly less Red than prior years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2004)

[2008 - Mc *retches* Mc *urp* Mccain vs. *heaves* Obama in 2008. The blue is beginning to creep further north and all 3 major cities, San Antonio, Austin and Houston, turn blue between 50 and 65%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2008)

[2012 - Romney vs. Osama in 2012 continues with traditional voting patterns with one major difference. The Large cities have now fallen to Blue and the South now matches the heavily saturated Dem base as the heavily saturated republican base in the North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2012)

It is of course impossible to reach a complete conclusion simply from these comparrisons, but it is possible to create theories.
From 1964 until 2018 is a period of 54 years. This will span at least 2 generations but potentially a third. 
Consider that, in many cases in the elections of new presidents, the race seems to be fought intensely on politics, with Texas dividing itself pretty equally across the state, with no meaningful geographic points to note of.
Within 25 years however, North and South have solidified, with those on the Mexican border heavily favouring Democrats whilst the North favours republicans.
Within 50 years, the large cities of Texas have fallen to Democrats whilst the blue encroaches further and further north whilst solidifying in the south.

The fact this change over time becomes most apparent within these two time frames (25 years and 50 years) is roughly the time it'll take to have and raise a child - with cities being natural hotbeads of migration from rural areas, and for College Students looking to study as well as those newly entering the workforce and looking for work. 

I'd appreciate anyone looking into this to come up for an alternative theory as to these trends, as a Historian, i'd very much enjoy alternative theories as to what is swinging voters in these geographic locations that does not amount to a cultural allegiance. ",ShadowReaperX07,e9aaa1i,The_Donald

""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" is from the Declaration Of Independence. One could claim (and logically rightfully so) that deliberately killing an infant (via abortion) is a clear violation of that infant's rights to the aforementioned phrase. 



(Also related: In a case of an auto accident/etc where a pregnant woman and/or her unborn infant is killed, the perp can be charged with the death of that pre-born infant. It is not seen as a ""clump of cells"" by the court system, it is seen as a pre-born infant person thus its death/injury results in legal charges. I find it very strange that the very same court system flip-flops around and sees a viable fetus either as a ""victim"" or as a ""clump of cells"" based on the mother's attitude toward the pre-born infant, in terms of her desire to keep or discard it.)",independentbystander,ea6gda9,The_Donald

FYI private clinics inside Canada perform neurosurgeries with an average wait time of about a week, forcing many Canadians to spend tens of thousands of dollars for healthcare on top of what they already paid for and arent receiving.

This is ""free healthcare."" It's terrible to the point of killing you or making you a drug addict but there's nothing you can do because there's no competing service.

As is typical, the government initially fought against private services because socialists don't want to help all people, they want them to suffer equally.

IN any case, Melania has a perfect right to voice her opinion  if she sees something that could be harmful to her husband's Presidency/

Putting yourself in a situation in which you need to swerve to avoid an accident is incredibly dangerous. Swerving greatly increases the chance of losing control of your vehicle and of colliding with something of which you were unaware.  


Generally speaking, the correct response on a public highway is to stay in your lane and apply threshhold-braking. Which if your car has ABS, simply means putting the brake on the floor and keeping it there.

Have a funny story that just happened actually, my GF is a UCLA grad and her friends are all UCLA and Berkeley HARDCORE Progressives.

Last weekend in Palm Springs, chatting with two Progressives about how I (34) consider myself a Liberal and had voted for several Democratic Presidents, but the idea of Intersectionality is something I find incredibly racist and divisive.

The girl (25) got so angry, after talking about politics alllll day, that she gufawwed in disgust and said ""I don't want to talk about politics anymore!""  even after I said I only wanted to talk about it and wasn't trying to defend. 

Her bf (27) who was sitting with us said, ""It's really just about bringing awareness to the plight of minorities"".   I was super greatful for such a response, but said I thought that it was just a form of division and is the main culprit for the Left-Right hatred we currently see.

His gf then made us stop talking about it, well, made HIM stop talking about it.

Order

They had to speed up their timeline due to Trump. Brexit will NOT be allowed to happen again. Should a nation decide to leave the EU, the EU army will invade, and remove the Non EU government from power. This was supposed to be the NATO army and the United Nations, however they realized with Trump and Putin, the Americans and Russians will NEVER ALLOW NATO troops on their soil, so they moved their One World Government to the true seat of power..

 Germany, and they want their Army to enforce the coming policies that they KNOW half the population will revolt against. Such as the UN pact on migration=No borders and free movement for EVERYONE. A one world Religion= Avoid Religious wars. (How benevolent) Flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims= White IQ too high, wont put up with low wages and living in shitty ghettos, and receiving social benefits instead of proudly working for a living. 

This will sound bad, but it isnt my opinion its theirs. They call this the [ KALERGI PLAN ] and I urge you to Google it. They feel that they must force race mixing, diversity, and tolerance in homogeneous nations that dislike migrants. (They Will use low birth rates as excuse and ending racism) "" We Need one brown race!"" They will say that this  it's a good thing because no more racism!

So for all you younger pedes...

1.One type of money for the entire world.

2. No borders, no National sovereignty.

3.One religion, (include all aspects of others)

4.One brown mixed race. (Easier to control, no racism, lower average IQ, more docile.) 

5. One army. (To enforce and impress the NWOs will upon nations that will surely reject  the above. Such as. Russia, Poland, Japan, USA, Hungary, and hopefully soon more.

>Accordingly, Mr. Trump requests that the Court consider the conduct and statements of Plaintiff and her counsel, and the benefits they have received from maintaining a dispute against Mr. Trump, and enter a sanctions award of an amount equal to or greater than the fee award, to deter Plaintiff from bring similar meritless actions in the future.
