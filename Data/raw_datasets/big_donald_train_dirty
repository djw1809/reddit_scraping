Without something being done about elections while it's still hot in the publics mind forget about anything else. As it is we're teetering on a banana republic. \\

They'll simply reverse everything and laugh in our faces while they're doing it. If this isn't fixed I'm telling you, Trump will lose. Not only because of voter fraud, but because the vote on our side will be so suppressed because many people, myself included, will have concluded that voting is pointless because they'll just manufacture ballots.

I would acknowledge this fact even if I thought her husband had done a good job as president (which, not that it's relevant here, I don't).  Princeton gave both her and her brother before her scholarships to go there, without a doubt transforming their lives.  In return, Michelle has been throwing shade at Princeton for years and years.  I have no doubt that she experienced some racism there, but a person with some sense of reflection can look back and say: ""hey, not everything about that experience was positive, but it did make a positive difference in my life"".

15476,"That's because when Leftists are talking about ""White"", they're talking about a specific philosophical approach in which there exists objective order to the universe and nature, in which can be derived through reason and logic. The principle behind science, is that the Logos is true. In which the rational mind is simply just trying to understand. This is what many early priests and mystics declared the term, ""made in the image of God"", referred to.


The Leftists, are all disciples of the Pharisees or Rabbis. They believe that there is no objective order, but that everything is arbitrary and maintained by arbitrary power structures through material force. This essentially means that all mathematicians, scientists, etc, are all mystics similar to priests of  Catholicism. 

This ""patriarchy"" is associated with White People, because it has been mainly cultivated by Catholics and their offshoot denominations since it was a powerful philosophy in Rome and Greek philosophy. Although the idea exists in China, India and many other places. 

Outside of ""White"" nations, it was simply a philosophical idea that remained dormant in favour of Emperor worship, or goddess worship and other ideas. ",Massive_Bluejay,e9nk634,The_Donald

That being said, you say we can't group everyone into one basket. However, the sad fact is that we can group most people in a basket. We have the data that backs up my claim that legal immigrants vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. The trend seems to be there, and it would be foolish to ignore it. 

Why do you think Democrats are so strongly pro-immigrant? It has been their plan for a long time to change the country demographically and have the votes to obtain permanent power. Most people from the third-world have no tradition of real democracy. They either get cared for by the state or don't get cared for at all. They also come from overwhelmingly corrupt countries. I'm afraid that Iraq falls into this category as well. Unfortunately, the US intervention there made things dramatically worse in many ways even despite the fact that Saddam was a monster. That doesn't mean Iraq doesn't have some great individuals, but the country as a whole has obviously not been so great for many of the people who lived there.

We can complain about identity politics all we want and try to change it. However, in the meantime, Republicans are on course to permanent loss of power. Too many immigrants benefit from identity politics and see no reason to give it up. 

I think it's totally cool that you have embraced American culture and vote to preserve it. The sad fact remains that most immigrants do not. We are apparently not smart enough to sort out those who want to preserve American culture (liberty, freedom, respect for the Constitution, etc) from those who do not. Until we can really do that, we need to put curb immigration and get our own house in order before we continue to open America's door. 

If we are going to have any sort of legal immigration, it needs to be a small number of people who can truly benefit America based on merit. Not some chain migration mess that invites all the world's poor.

We’d be pissed and feel under-represented. Then after enduring two years of rule under HRC, assuming we still had a country, imagine the House goes red in 2018 — we’d feel vindicated and that justice had won the day. That’s how the Dems feel, I’m sure.

This guy has been fighting it for years. [He met with secret service today at 1 because of this video where he says it](https://youtu.be/Mz8Ebt4UEK4). The courts are rigged all the way up to chief justice roberts to sell our patents to the uk privy council, the gov, and china, they purposely prevent any investigations into our electronic vote machines because those same groups (specifically the uk privy council (who also control soros in this regard)) are the ones that control them. The courts are 100% rigged to allow the election fraud. The most important part of america are our ideas, everything that you see, the world's entire reality is based on american ideas, but the supreme court are allowing them to be suppressed to the tune of 5000+ patents PER YEAR. The writ of mandamus above ties in the patent theft and rigged vote machines to foreign election meddling from uk privy council, china, and traitors within the us government. The patent theft ties in because the technology behind social media and the entire modern internet(web 2.0) was stolen from michael mckibbens leaders technology, which went all the way up to the supreme court in Leaders Technology vs Facebook. The supreme court hearing was won by leaders tech in that they proved the tech was stolen by facebook  adn the us government but supreme court chief justice whom had a stake in facebook, ruled that facebook didnt have to pay leaders tech a dime, and gave the case to facebook. Turns out all of social media was being predicted by the cia and uk privy council back in 1999 when Leaders Technology first applied for their patent. It later became the web 2.0 (modern social media internet) after getting partial source code stolen in 2003 (by their own dc patent lawyer). Point being, the cia and uk privy council backed social media after stealing it from leaders tech for 2 specific reasons. One was to spy on everyone, and 2 was to MANPULATE ELECTIONS!!!! This guy Christopher Stronk ties it all together in that writ of mandumus. READ IT & SPREAD IT!  ",A_Plagiarize_Zest,e9c6yfn,The_Donald

THIS WAS A TRAP.


Consider if you will, that pre-existing laws were probably lifted in counties to allow for a sting operation against this National Emergency. Something like this…

1. Allow Dems to illegally add votes HIGHER to a certain level to get them close enough to a win to motivate more fraud or to allow outright fraud and temporary victory.

2. Allow Rep votes counts to be artificially reported LOWER for a time frame post election to motivate Dems to risk fraud to bridge the gap.

3. Allow DHS to use video surveillance and forensic tracking in these counties to confirm and trap non-citizen voting.

4. Make sure real vote counts are tracked to ensure every legal vote counted for every legal voter regardless of party.

5. Make sure that the fraud ties back into media and social media companies to take them down as well.

NOW CHILL OUT AND WATCH THE TAKEDOWN.

This is so freaking obvious.  It is a sting.  It has always been a sting.  Enjoy watching it.  Quit freaking out.  We have the full weight of the world's largest military intel behind this operation.  Nothing happens that we don't want to happen, and we control the courts and narrative now.  Once they can't get their people elected, they have no future or power.  Remember it is easier to arrest people than destroy institutions.

This guy has been fighting it for years. [He met with secret service today at 1 because of this video where he says it](https://youtu.be/Mz8Ebt4UEK4). The courts are rigged all the way up to chief justice roberts to sell our patents to the uk privy council, the gov, and china, they purposely prevent any investigations into our electronic vote machines because those same groups (specifically the uk privy council (who also control soros in this regard)) are the ones that control them. The courts are 100% rigged to allow the election fraud. The most important part of america are our ideas, everything that you see, the world's entire reality is based on american ideas, but the supreme court are allowing them to be suppressed to the tune of 5000+ patents PER YEAR. The writ of mandamus above ties in the patent theft and rigged vote machines to foreign election meddling from uk privy council, china, and traitors within the us government. The patent theft ties in because the technology behind social media and the entire modern internet(web 2.0) was stolen from michael mckibbens leaders technology, which went all the way up to the supreme court in Leaders Technology vs Facebook. The supreme court hearing was won by leaders tech in that they proved the tech was stolen by facebook  adn the us government but supreme court chief justice whom had a stake in facebook, ruled that facebook didnt have to pay leaders tech a dime, and gave the case to facebook. Turns out all of social media was being predicted by the cia and uk privy council back in 1999 when Leaders Technology first applied for their patent. It later became the web 2.0 (modern social media internet) after getting partial source code stolen in 2003 (by their own dc patent lawyer). Point being, the cia and uk privy council backed social media after steling it from leaders tech for 2 specific reasons. One was to spy on everyone, and 2 was to MANIPULATE ELECTIONS!!!!

Most of the attention was devoted to her critique of Donald Trump:

>“I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president,” she said. “For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.”

Hidden away was this nugget:

>It was a credit to the eight-member court that it deadlocked only four times, she said, given the ideological divide between its liberal and conservative wings, both with four members.  
 One of the 4-4 ties, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, averted what would have been a severe blow to public unions had Justice Scalia participated. “This court couldn’t have done better than it did,” Justice Ginsburg said of the deadlock. When the case was argued in January, the majority seemed prepared to overrule a 1977 precedent that allowed public unions to charge nonmembers fees to pay for collective bargaining.  
 A second deadlock, in United States v. Texas, left in place a nationwide injunction blocking Mr. Obama’s plan to spare more than four million unauthorized immigrants from deportation and allow them to work. That was unfortunate, Justice Ginsburg said, but it could have been worse.  
 “Think what would have happened had Justice Scalia remained with us,” she said. Instead of a single sentence announcing the tie, she suggested, a five-justice majority would have issued a precedent-setting decision dealing a lasting setback to Mr. Obama and the immigrants he had tried to protect.

When given a choice between the life of a friend and pushing forward with profoundly anti-American, anti-freedom, and anti-Constitutional policies, Ginsburg doesn’t hesitate to say, “Think what would have happened had Justice Scalia remained with us.”",LepricPolymath,e9amve2,The_Donald

Federal prosecutors reviewing altered election documents tied to Florida Democrats     
     

By MATT DIXON     

11/14/2018 09:01 AM EST     
     
TALLAHASSEE — The Florida Department of State last week asked federal prosecutors to investigate dates that were changed on official state election documents, the first voting “irregularities” it has flagged in the wake of the 2018 elections.

The concerns, which the department says can be tied to the Florida Democratic Party, center around date changes on forms used to fix vote-by-mail ballots sent with incorrect or missing information. Known as “cure affidavits,” those documents used to fix mail ballots were due no later than 5 p.m. on Nov. 5 — the day before the election. But affidavits released on Tuesday by the DOS show that documents from four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m. on Thursday, which is not accurate.

Among those counties is Broward, which emerged as the epicenter of controversy as three statewide races and three local legislative races went into recounts following the Nov. 6 elections. Republicans have pointed to embattled Broward Elections chief Brenda Snipes' record of past election gaffes in arguing that the largely Democratic country is tilted against them — perhaps fraudulently so.

DOS officials have repeatedly told the media that the monitors they sent to Broward County saw no election fraud. It wasn't until Tuesday that the office revealed publicly that it had turned over information to federal prosecutors.

The information was sent on Nov. 9 by Bradley McVay, DOS’ interim general counsel, who asked that the altered dates be investigated.

“Altering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect … imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter’s ability to vote,” McVay wrote in a letter that was sent Nov. 9 and released publicly on Tuesday. The letter was sent to U.S. Attorneys Christopher P. Canova of the Northern District of Florida, Maria Chapa Lopez of the Middle District of Florida and Ariana Fajardo Orshan in the Southern District of Florida.

The records released by DOS, which is part of Gov. Rick Scott’s administration, point the finger at the Florida Democratic Party. Political parties can get daily lists of people who had their mail-in ballots rejected. Political parties — or anyone else — can also get the publicly available cure affidavits and send them to voters who had a mail-in ballot rejected to encourage them to fix the ballots.

In an email chain released as part of the Department of State's Tuesday document dump, Citrus County Supervisor of Elections Susan Gill last week told DOS officials that a voter who received one of the cure affidavits with the wrong date had also received a call from a number identified as the Tallahassee office of the Florida Democratic Party, an indication the party was reaching out about her vote by mail ballot.

""When I called it, it is the Democratic Party of Florida,"" she said in a Nov. 8 email to DOS officials.

She went on to write that she thinks the incorrect date was used because whoever sent the cure affidavit mixed up the deadline for cure affidavits with the deadline for provisional ballots. But, she said, ""a bigger problem is the fact they actually changed one of the DOE forms.""

That change to an official election form was what state officials turned over to federal prosecutors.

Another email included in the DOS document dump included correspondence from Okaloosa County Supervisor of Elections Paul Lux, who also said he believed the affidavits were from the Florida Democratic Party.

""Please pass the word to the FDP that they can't arbitrarily add their own deadline to your form or VBM cures!!"" Lux emailed DOS officials on Nov. 9. ""This is crazy!""

In a Tuesday interview with POLITICO, Lux said he received an email from someone sending a cure affidavit marked with the wrong date that included a Florida Democratic Party email address. The email does contain the email address votes@FloridaDems.org, which is associated with the party.

Caroline Rowland, an FDP spokesperson, brushed off the issue, saying the Scott administration’s election office was drumming it up as a distraction.

""The courts have already forced Rick Scott to drop a lawsuit after false claims of fraud, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement rejected his desperate attempts to interfere with the important work of counting ballots,” she said in an email. “Now, Scott is once again trying to divert attention and resources from a smooth and successful recount.""",whiskey_shitz,e9ond08,The_Donald

Back then, they were arguing whether the voter meant to punch out the card if the little paper chad was still attached).

12052,"I am an election official in Ohio,  a Machine Judge.  The precinct I was assigned to last week is directly across Lane Avenue from The Ohio State University,  roughly a 35k student body.  Every precinct I have worked in past elections had a total of no more than 10 Provisional Ballots on Election Day, I stopped counting Provisional Ballots when it hit 100.  In Ohio there are several positions per precinct.:  

-Roster Judges- certifies the person is eligible to vote

-Machine Judges- monitors the actual voting machines

-Provisional Judges- administers a paper ballot when authorized by the Roster Judge

-Voting Location Manager- Oversees all activity for that precinct. 

The VLM for this precinct is life partners with one of the  Roster Judges and his 2 BFF's also manned this precinct  one a Machine Judge and the other a Provisional Judge.  About 3pm that day I was approached by a man that said...""I voted Absentee Ballot in my home state of Arizona, I want to vote in Ohio..."" I told him that I don't think he could, as that would be a double vote, but ultimately directed him to the Roster Table to speak with the Roster Judges.  I kept an eye on him from across the room and he was given a Paper Ballot.   The was 10 times the normal Provisional Ballots, at least. There is no way to know proof positive that people are not double voting from state to state as the County is the entity that administers the election at the local level with guidelines set forth by the Ohio Secretary of State. 

I had to vote early because on election day we work from 5:30am to 8:30pm .  I went to the Morse Rd Franklin County Board of Elections to vote November 1...I walked into the building and was handed a form to fill out and took it to the Roster Judge table...not once did she ask me for ID, proof of residency or anything.  Something REALLY shady going on...there had to be 200 people there voting when I was there.  

Obviously I know I can not go to the BoE because the complaint would never get dealt with...Democrat City.

There were other issues I witnessed being done by the VLM and a BoE runner that were inappropriate, but I don't know where to address them.

French politics is divided up heavily through a range of political parties (take a look at how many decently sized players there are on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2019_(France)#Opinion_polls)... 


Le Pen typically does better in European Elections anyway (even discounting voting intention). 'Far-right parties' only have ~30% of voting intentions atm (article linked said they had ~25% in August, so 5% increase), with Le Pen on 21%. Macron's LREM has 20% of voting intentions.


However, as there are many parties, there are also many left wing ones - the previous President (Francois Hollande) came from a party called the ""Parti socialiste"" which are quite left wing. They are looking at around 6% of voting intentions atm.


The European Elections are coming up soon (for the European parliament) but the French Presidential Elections occur every five years (next in 2022), so for France's domestic policy, this doesn't mean too much (granted, a lot of their policy is influenced heavily by the EU).

The problem is that the fires are more destructive than ever and all the studies (and history) show that the reason they are so intense and destructive now is a result of improper management.  The inability to clear out old wood added to the fact that the know-it-all liberals practically stopped the logging industry after they planted thousands of trees where there had never been any, means that there is more fuel for fires than ever in history.  Ironically, it's the fact that there was too much rain is why the fires have been intense lately because the grass has been growing more than usual.

It's about hygiene more than anything, and never stopped me from jerking. Every girl I had ever been with loved I was circumcised. I lasted longer, which they loved, and no hygiene issues.

In the end, fgm is about supression of a women's ability to enjoy sex.  Only twisted people would not care about this or wanting their partner not to enjoy God's gift to us. The intimate connection and bond formed is beyond anything else. Fgm just forces women to be nothing other than sexual vessels for twisted men,  possessions to be thrown away and oppressed.

12991,"I believe the allegation was only ""extremist"" and that only appeared in the executive summary of a Vancouver sheriff internal report. The report internals made that same statement ""extremist"" but did not support it and had no other detail from the FBI. It seemed a very generic statement  and it seems also that it would be proper for this kind of statement to be attributed in more detail to the FBI. In other words, if the FBI actually said such a thing, it should be attributed more specifically in this type of report, i.e. ""A spokesman for the Vancouver field office of the FBI stated on XXXXX date that ..."" . Or perhaps if there was a written list of extremist groups in the area it would be lined or referenced. I think the lack of these details makes the claim highly suspect. Real journalists would be looking into this aspect, but what we have instead is many, many outlets simply repeating it.

1627,"Considering a number of MGTOW are Christians, myself included, I must entirely disagree with you. The Bible itself even warns against foul women, which are in great number these days as many of them have abandoned Christian values. It even talks about being wary of a woman who seems perfect, for she is like the rarest rubies. She doesn’t exist. I’ve also met a number of men who later became Christian or rejoined the faith after becoming MGTOW. We actually had many of them taking about it on a post several days ago, maybe a week. 

There’s nothing wrong with men protecting their assets either. Nothing wrong with demanding women, in a world where they declare themselves equal (and above men in many cases) to men, pay for their own meals on a date. They work after all and are entitled to nothing of the man’s. Our court system sees it the opposite however, and will ruin a man to provide for a woman in a divorce. Draining his financial assets, throwing him from his home and in some cases forcing him to sell his home and vehicles. These are the vast majority of divorces cases. Divorce itself is at all time highs and most of them are not only initiated by women but, are initiated as no fault divorces. It should also be noted that marriage rates are at all time lows. Men see how bad divorce is, how often good men are divorced by “good” women and have calculated the risks, deeming them to be far to high. This is all ultimately the result of feminism.

Have you seen a lot of footage of this on the news? I mean 650,000 people all in Washington marching together seems like it would be a news story, doesn't it? It seems like those images would be pretty spectacular. 

Now think. Think of all the images you have of the Pussy March. Think of all the articles you read. Think about how if you mentioned it to just about anyone, they would know exactly what you were referring to and have an opinion on it themselves. Now imagine asking that same person about The March for Life. Would they have heard of it? Would they have images of it? Would they even believe it? 

That's the problem with the corporate media. Six global conglomerates own and control everything people see (even Fox). So if Republicans march, it could be two million people, three million people, probably even ten million people, and no one would know about it. If the global conglomerates aren't on our side (and they're not), they aren't going to help us. They aren't going to amplify and promote our message the way they do Democrats.

However being armed and ready does not mean you still dont call the police and shelter in a safe place if you suspect a home invasion, to not do those simple things is just stupid and just putting yourself and kids in danger. 

You call the police because 1. A crime is being committed, 2. If if you are armed and ready you want armed backup ASAP you dont know if you are out numbered and there is absolutely no guarantee that your aim or shots will be more accurate then your opponent no matter how much you practice. 3.

Even the NYT, along with sources like the United States Holocaust Museum Memorial, have noted the rise of antisemitism in both the left and the right, noting that it typically transcends bi-partisan politics. In fact, if you look at the well documented rise of antisemitism on US college campuses, nearly every incident has its roots in the pro-palestinian/antizionist movements. I'm baffled how the shooting is Trump's fault, when the guy hated trump for not being an antizionist or antisemite.

This guy has been fighting it for years. [He met with secret service today at 1 because of this video where he says it](https://youtu.be/Mz8Ebt4UEK4). The courts are rigged all the way up to chief justice roberts to sell our patents to the uk privy council, the gov, and china, they purposely prevent any investigations into our electronic vote machines because those same groups (specifically the uk privy council (who also control soros in this regard)) are the ones that control them. The courts are 100% rigged to allow the election fraud. The most important part of america are our ideas, everything that you see, the world's entire reality is based on american ideas, but the supreme court are allowing them to be suppressed to the tune of 5000+ patents PER YEAR. The writ of mandamus above ties in the patent theft and rigged vote machines to foreign election meddling from uk privy council, china, and traitors wihin the us government. The patent theft ties in because the technology behind social media and the entire modern internet(web 2.0) was stolen from michael mckibbens leaders technology, which went all the way up to the supreme court in Leaders Technology vs Facebook. The supreme court hearing was won by leaders tech in that they proved the tech was stolen by facebook  adn the us government but supreme court chief justice whom had a stake in facebook, ruled that facebook didnt have to pay leaders tech a dime, and gave the case to facebook. Turns out all of social media was being predicted by the cia and uk privy council back in 1999 when Leaders Technology first applied fr their patent. It later became the web 2.0 (modern social media internet) after getting partial source code stolen in 2003 (by their own dc patent lawyer). Point being, the cia and uk privy council backed social media after steling it from leaders tech for 2 specific reasons. One was to spy on everyone, and 2 was to MANIPULATE ELECTIONS!!!!

Soros is a heartless financier who deals in financial manipulation behind a broad strategy of societal destabilization. He funds Marxism because it causes just enough anarchy for him to be robber baron. He’s also a proud Nazi collaborator who cares not one ounce for the lasting destruction his actions create. 

Even if western countries are swarmed by low IQ anti-semites and the light of western civilization goes out, he will cackle to the grave playing with the still burning embers of what was. 

He’s the puppet master behind Marxism. The war profiteer, the calamity causer. His well funded minions burrow in a million tunnels through our sacred structures. Our families, our religions, our nations. Undermining everything. 

Soros despises family, culture, heritage, anything that represents a strength he does not control. Our love for one another is our shield. Reject Marxism!

We just need to close our borders and get our birthrate UP to a sustainable position(2-3).  We need to cut out all welfare programs so the poor have to beg for handouts.  Active eugenics by the government is a recipe for disaster.  ",PlasmaBurnz,ea691of,The_Donald

18791,"I was a liberal in high school which was nearly 20 years ago. And we had a social justice reading group. We read tons of documents on corporate corruption in the government and how neocon defense contractors and government were working together to create wars overseas. We also saw the state of the poor in America. Including people jailed for victimless crimes like having marijuana. So we were against all of that. Of course I was just a kid so I didn’t have much more than being “against” stuff. Now, nearly 20 years later with a lot of work experience I generally feel the same way. Unnecessary foreign wars are bad, and we should help make America a better place instead. Let’s have less crime and better jobs and schools in America. These were the same ideas that we had back then except with productive ideas not just reactive “against” ideas. Nothing has changed for me. No corruption in government and help out America first before doing foreign bullshit that usually makes things worse anyway. Who are these modern day liberals? I don’t remember seeing any of these types of guys in our reading group. These were the mainstream kids. They were not punks back then when it actually made you a rebel to be punk. They were mainstream then, and they’re mainstream now. It’s just that now, it’s mainstream to be liberal. Paul Joseph Watson said it best: conservative is the new punk.

In doing so, she blatantly violated the Code of Conduct for United States Judges:

""Canon 5: A Judge Should Refrain from Political Activity

(A) General Prohibitions. **A judge should not**:

(1) act as a leader or hold any office in a political organization;

(2) make speeches for a political organization or candidate, or **publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office**; or

(3) solicit funds for, pay an assessment to, or make a contribution to a political organization or candidate, or attend or purchase a ticket for a dinner or other event sponsored by a political organization or candidate.""

Cruz is clearly the villian in Carry's eyes, and so he is depicted more as a classic ""fat cat"" mobster from a Warner Bros. cartoon rather than Cruz himself. O'Rourke lacks a lot of similarity to the subject (especially the nose), but is depicted more as the saintly hero in a style reminiscent of Renaissance art.

* Republican votes obviously aren't well distributed in enough numbers among different districts or not enough Republicans from all districts went out to vote; however, Republicans from certain areas overperformed DemocRATS enough to have a win at the state level.

* Some Republicans just couldn't think clearly enough to vote red even if their House Rep was a RINO traitor but liked their Senator and/or governor candidate.

* In case of states in which the Republicans won the governorship but not the Senate seat and/or not most House seats, a big factor could be that never Trumpers and even DemocRATS don't want their state to increase taxes, become sanctuary states, or become Venezuela so they voted for the Republican governor; however, they still hate Trump, so they didn't want to vote for Senators and Congressmen who would help Trump in Congress.

* I have no proof of this, but considering how corrupt the DemocRAT cheaters are, I believe it to be very possible that, every time DemocRATS lose by a narrow margin, they pay enough DemocRAT or ""couldn't-give-a-shit"" voters to move to these key districts where they had a narrow loss and they have also been doing some gerrymandering.",leing15,e99aw2m,The_Donald

The standards are low and all it shows is x percent graduate, x percent pass whatever test - the metrics exist to show progress, not to depict accuracy in skills. You don’t move forward until you master the fundamentals - a ‘D’ is 60 percent - that means you don’t know 40 percent of the goddamned material.

1148,"If you wanted ""insurance"", you would need to create a legitimate source for your intelligence in order to make it actionable in a way that goes beyond just PR.

If you wanted to set someone up and had all the resources of a President at your disposal, you'd use one of the five eyes members to pass you intelligence. You'd use that to create an outline of connections that you can make look like they are nefarious (think shit like 'Russian mafia' buying Trump condos). These are innocuous things, most people cross paths with criminals, or people connected to them. Most of us have someone in our family who is on the wrong side of the law.

Then you'd start to put assets in place in order to create a misleading narrative. You'd get a warrant (FISA or otherwise), monitor them, and collect the manufactured evidence that fits with the narrative you've planned. 

So imagine if Trump had sent an email to someone on July 20th, 2016 saying ""I got your package, it was wonderful!"" Package being a gift basket or something innocuous. Then you'd get a FISA on someone remotely connected to Trump, have an asset contact them and say ""Yeah, Trump got a package of Hillary's emails on July 20th"". And suddenly you have enough evidence to search Trump's email, find the message that 'proves' he got a package, and it bolsters your case.

The other vampires muttered among themselves. Lindsey, the most shy of vampires, said “Can we do that?” The Count smiled. “Of course; you always could!” The clergy was agape. They wailed, “Now he’ll drink our blood!” Trumpula straightened his vest a bit. “Actually it was you that always did that, not us. And worse! We’ll be looking into your conduct soon.” The flock scattered. And to the vampires he said,”You were always the heroes of your own story. Write it yourselves.” And Lindsey led the way out into the daylight. A banshee wailed its most wretched curse. It sounded to him like gay music. He thought of all the times he had hid from the sun.

24311,"Yeah, I think that's a big part of it. When times are good, people look for villains. When times are bad, people look for heroes. We've had it pretty darn good since the end of the Cold War, so the recent generations are mostly looking for people to blame for the stupidest things.

However, that's still only part of the problem. The other issue is the psycho-social brainwashing that's been going on since the 60's. I grew up in the 70's and 80's, so I saw the slide in values from the old B&W TV shows to the newer ones. In the past, personal responsibility and morality was always emphasized. So if something went wrong, it was usually ""your own damn fault"". Moving into the 80's and 90's, there were more stories about victimization and oppression...i.e. the problems were coming from around and above the main character. Also morality became ""flexible""...you started seeing spouses having affairs, but it was presented as ""OK"" because it was a bad marriage after all.

Carter **NEVER** served on a nuclear sub. He went to school for it in 1952/53, and left the Navy in 1953 when his father died, to take over the family's peanut farm business.

Also, Reagan was 13 years older than Carter. His military career began in 1937 and ended with the end of WW2, in 1945. Whereas, Carter's military career began in 1946. So when Reagan acted in the 1951 film *Bedtime for Bonzo*, he was already a 40-year-old actor, and Carter was a 27-year-old Naval officer.",Sympathy_for_the_FO,ea7dmud,The_Donald

26617,"I was visiting the United States earlier this year in May, and while driving from Pittsburgh, PA to Nokomis, FL I saw a crazy guy do a break check on th I-95 just outside Woodbine, GA, on a bridge across the Satilla river. It was 8 pm, and very dark.



The car in front of mine, on the right lane was occupied by a single middle age woman. She was forced to hit the brakes and steer right into the divider wall of the bridge, crossing all 3 lanes and hitting that wall at high-speed and what seemed to be a 60º angle.



My brother was driving, I was in the passenger seat and my mom was in the back. We were was just 5 or 6 seconds behind her, so he was able to swerve and stop some 50 yards in front of her.



As we were stopping I told him stay in the car, don't follow me until I call you. I feared that whoever was in the car might be dead or dying, and the incoming traffic did not slow down at all, those maniacs kept going at 80 mph or more.



I jumped out of our car, and run as fast as I could on the shoulder of that bridge, with cars zooming by a few feet at my right. It was just a 50 meters distance, but I can tell you, it felt a lot longer. Insanity.



I approached the accident and had to momentarily step in the high-speed lane. The smell of a crashed car is awful, a mixture of gunpowder, coolant fluid, hot gases, and burnt rubber and plastic. The driver was awake, still recovering from the impact maybe 20 seconds earlier, needless to say she was in deep shock.



Lucky for her, I am a ICU physician, and before that I worked in the ER for 12 years. I performed the fastest diagnostics I ever did, and extricated her from the wreckage. No major wounds were evident. She did answer all my questions, with an initial GCS of 15/15.



By this time, my brother had come to, and recognizing we were all in great danger, we left the woman, and started moving those road cones some 150 meters before the crashed car. Scary stuff.



2 other cars stopped on the right side of the road, and one of them was an off duty police officer who called the sheriff. The first emergency vehicle showed up 07:45 minutes after the crash (I timed it), which was just astonishing.



As I did a recheck on her before the paramedics arrived, she went into shock. She started asking weird questions, making no sense at all. I was afraid it was a sign of brain trauma, but she was pretty much saved by the airbags, I feared I was missing something.



In the end, it was just the fear setting in. I have attended a lot of injured people, but this was one of the very few cases were I saw the accident happen. That kind of fear and shock is hard to comprehend.



The troopers arrived, and I calmed them down, letting them know she was OK, and needed an ambulance that was just pulling in. They cut the left lane, and started a little traffic jam, protected us as best possible by parking their cruisers way back, next to were my brother and I marked with the cones.



The paramedics confirmed her vital signs, sat her in a big ambulance and, to my shock, the troopers interrogated her right there. I gave them a lengthy statement by writing as well, making sure to describe all her semiological data. I didn't see the assassin who braked check her, just his tail lights.



All things considered, we were there for some 50 minutes, exhausted and unable to continue, we had to stop (unexpectedly) at the dirtiest Motel 6 in existence, by the Jacksonville airport north. I didn't take my shoes off.



There is a happy ending, we got to Nokomis the next day by noon, a super cute small town on the gulf coast, and we got to spend some 4 days there. Visited Myakka River State Park, and saw many gators. Wild stuff ¡Ja! ¡Ja! ¡Ja! ¡Ja!",Buitreaux,e9lpnkz,The_Donald

18210,"Strange, so why isn't Brenda Snipes and cuffs for violating the order of a federal court judge? Why is nobody in cuffs for the on video voter fraud.

in fact why is nobody being prosecuted for all the shit that we have found out about over the last 2 years.

Why because I guarantee if any of us had committed any of these crimes our asses would be in jail right now.

We all know swampy sessions and rotten Rosenstein we're backing the Democrats and covering for Hillary but they're supposed to be gone now so what's the holdup.

Frankly unless Trump is able to get this wall built during the lame duck session this wall is not getting built. unless this voter fraud is taken care of with extreme levels of consequences for all who are involved Trump is not winning in 2020, it will not matter how many people vote for him they will just flip the election and say ""oh we found some more ballots! fuck you he lost. Oh and anyone else we want to lose has lost. Because fuck you, what are you going to do about it?""

I didn't want to Trump is out of office they're going to put in whoever the fuck they want and that giant ass migrant Caravan we see sitting outside our border is getting let in and they're going to drop them on every single red state in the Union and guess what folks that's it at that point there won't be any more elections. Oh we will have a show every few years a nice little round of theatrics. But the fact of the matter is they're going to have enough people to counteract our votes and what they can't counteract will have a much smaller Gap they need to close with the fake votes.

This is how it all goes down. This is the end game.

Trump was never supposed to win in 2016, and his victory has caused the establishment and the powers-that-be to panic and this is what their panic mode looks like just naked corruption voter fraud stolen elections and the complete destruction of any possibility of a fair election ever again.

Honestly if this shit doesn't get handled one way or another I'm just done I'm not voting anymore because there's no point I'm not going to waste my time doing the Kabuki play as if anything I do or say or any of our votes will have any meaning whatsoever and aren't just going to be overturned by mass-produced fucking ballots loaded into trucks at 2 a.m from the back of democrat's cars.",AutisticIllegalAlien,e9mawds,The_Donald

9102,"Thanks for the response. I agree investment is essential, we can't expect a tribe to adopt capitalist ideals and become wealthy nor do I believe I have said anything to suggest that. My main gripe is the misuse of what communism is. It was the inspiration of governments under Mao, Stalin and such, but these governments followed barely any communist agenda. They were all socialist/fascist. In the same theme, people generalise the USA as the very embodiment of the free-market system. You probably know that it's quite from the truth, heavy regulations, the interest rate is determined, tariffs and protectionism is happening, anti-competitive tactics from companies. I guess I don't like these gross tribal mindsets that frame something in absolutes ""all trump supporters are fascists"" ""all communists are starving"" ""All NAZI's supporters want to genocide jews"".   

I also wouldn't say the NAZI's were strictly national socialists. During times of world war 2, total war was implemented to great effect by countries like Germany and Great Brittain. Total war greatly enhances socialist aspects of a country as any and everything that might help win the war is seized indefinitely. So the NAZI's have this guise of socialism when in reality, the birth of Hitlers party as an autocratic state saw a heavily fascist regime but economically, a mixed socialist and capitalist system where a lot was nationally controlled but also a lot was fueled by Hitler's ties to extremely rich German conservatives. Its economy was definitely unique. Remember Hitler fucking hated communists and wanted to expand into Russia for German living space. 

this is a good read https://www.nber.org/chapters/c9476.pdf

I guess this is off topic, but I have studied artificial intelligence and automation to a degree. Presuming that the next era of progress in humanity starts with the total integration of these forces (the automation era, where we can 3d print organs are a thing and every entity can be better controlled by a program than a human) would it make capitalism and socialism more viable in poorer countries? Would we see a majority of civilians lose leverage (their labour) over the small % of people that own these technologies?",SirBessley,e9cg3fs,The_Donald

You need to understand and accept this so you can add that fact to your play book, as folks like the Koch brothers have. Republicans will need to play the long game in order to succeed, and the only issue I see with Trump is that it's riling up liberals in such a way that any gains made right now might be too short sighted.

It really took the perfect storm of events, public sentiment, etc.

The irony of this is that I would now say that Trump is very similar to Charles de Gaulle in his outlook and leadership as a head of state.

They definitely don't want to be paying top salary to a ""reporter"" that got sidelined and all else they can do is tweet.

If we don't enforce our borders people will come from all over for free Healthcare because our health care professionals take an oathe to not turn people away. And if they do they'd be sued. Now, that doesn't mean elective procedures. But if they make it socialized by law it would no doubt include elective procedures.

But i can also attest to our native American (Indian) tribes health care. They have socialized medicine, free health care for natives. And it sucks. You will maybe see a doctor by the time they leave at 5pm if you get there by 5am. And if someone else comes in that someone prioritizes over you then your screwed. And I've watched people just get prescribed Tylenol after having teeth pulled or dental procedures. And during the procedure you only get a local anesthetic. It is a nightmare.

I come from a country with free healthcare and since the system was put in practice the waiting time for almost any treatment with the exception of dental care sky rocketed to the point that to get a simple appointment with a neurologist to be examined you first need a pass to be given to you by general doctors which can be done after hours of waiting but costs the equivalent to $10, then you get the appointment for about 30 days later with the specialist which costs another $10, who will then ask you for MRI, CTI or Radiography (only one of those if you are lucky) for which you'll have to wait two weeks to perform and then two more for the results at a cost of about $100 each. Then take the results back to the specialist for a definitive diagnosis so in the best case scenario you are looking at a two and a half month waiting period and about $200 just to get diagnosed with something, while in the meantime the healthcare system takes 10% of your monthly income.

3004,"That's a half measure and is still very vulnerable to attack.  

Here's my $0.02(Also public ledger implementation, but cuts out the risk of 51% attacks by requiring three factor authentication:  

First thing that needs to happen is a federally uniform voter ID, with a specific algorithm for ID numbers.  

In Israel, our national IDs(the ID number is also printed in passports and driver licenses) are 9 digits long:  
The first digit shows whether someone is an immigrant(3) or was born in Israel(2).  
Digits 2 through 8 are generated according to whatever algorithm.  
Digit 9 is a check sum, meaning that if you sum the digits of all 8 previous digits, then sum them up until you are left with 1 digit, it will equal the 9th digit.  

So the federal government would have a list of ID NUMBERS that are currently active, but not who it belongs to.

After the above is complete, create a blockchain ledger that does some fuckery on that number to create a 64 character hash.  

The 64 character hash will only be created if the algorithm receives confirmation that the ID is valid(Meaning it is in the federal government), and doesn't already exist on the blockchain.  

An ID number is assigned at birth(Will contain say... 1 digit for citizen(1= citizen, 2 = immigrant), a 2 digit code for state, 2 digit code for congressional district, 12 digits for the ID number itself, and a checksum digit), or at naturalization(structure should be functionally identical), by assigned I mean the hospital reports a live birth, and a number is generated in the system to keep that voter spot.  

On a state level, to get your voter card, you will need to do a fingerprint scan and enter your national ID number.  

Behind the scenes, the blockchain confirms that this national ID is real, active, and doesn't have an ID active yet.  

So the 64 character hash of your national ID, along with a hash of your fingerprint are summed, hashed again, and that hash(Not your finger print or the national ID) is saved on an RFID chip inside the card.  

When it's time to vote, you stick your card in the machine, scan your finger, and enter the ID number.  
If the hash of the ID number and the fingerprint matches the hash that is saved on the ID card, the vote is recorded on the blockchain using the national ID hash, and you can verify it almost instantly by accessing an app.  

Thus, voting is anonimized and fully open sourced.  

Edit:  
The state and district thing doesn't change as a person moves to a different state, but instead what happens is that when someone moves to a different state, they update their address, and are issued a new voter ID for the new district they are in, and that ID is automatically removed from the rolls in the birth state.  

Alternatively, the state and district numbers are not included in the hash and check sum, and with every move, the district and state ID is updated.  

Actually, if it's not a part of the hash, it could be visible publicly, and then, you can vote in the district you are registered to vote in from any polling station in the US, or abroad, as long as you come to an embassy",MaxWyght,e9cwzau,The_Donald

It’s legitimate when they win and “horrifying” if anyone questions it yet some of them assume it’s illegitimate when and if Republicans win.

I think a lot of people on the left have trouble believing how many people actually support the president.  To many people it’s a foregone conclusion that he’s completely evil and they have a hard time swallowing the idea that so many people are OK with it.

Personally I think most people are good and that both Democrats and Republicans want what’s best for this country.  We all just have different ideas about how to get there and that’s OK. 

I consider the push/pull cycle of the two-party system as another layer of checks and balances on government.  Conservatives try to protect society from the unintended consequences and hubris of idealism that can lead to the errors of the future.

Liberals and progressives seemed focused on correcting society from the perceived errors of the past.

I like to think of it like were all riding along in a big bus called America. Liberals are stepping on the gas as hard as they can to keep us moving forward and pushing us over the big inclines.  Conservatives are in charge of the brakes so we don’t get out of control when the twists, turns and steep downhills present themselves.  I don’t really think there’s anyone steering this vehicle though.

I truly think we need each other. We need to listen to each other.

Finally someone that understands this. The commie media complex has so controlled the narrative post-World War II that even people on the right fall into it by using 'fascist' as an insult to even outed Communists - as though Communist isn't a bad enough distinction by itself.

I'll say it outright, Communists by and large have a far worse track record than Fascists - and I'd take it further: They aren't any better than Nazis. The Nazi regime didn't even kill half the people Stalin's regime did, and barely a fraction of the total deathtoll of Communists worldwide - of course commies dismiss this as 'yes, but their intent was good! It wasn't based on hate!' Really? The average Nazi had good intent, too - go back and time and ask any Nazi if his intent was 'based on hate' Heck, even Hitler had good intentions, they all do.

Another fallback argument is 'yes, but the Nazi regime showed \*cue ominous music\* the 'dangers of racism' =\_=' - well, then, since their deathtoll was a fraction of the Communists and their methods no less cruel, evidently the 'dangers of racism' are far less devastating than the dangers of radical Communism.",PingsBings,e9a7ddp,The_Donald

But then food is easy to get so there is no longer an evolutionary pressure selecting for highly effective people. In fact, it selects whoever can exploit the good times to excess the fastest, so liberals.

Then there are too many organisms for the food supply again and it becomes competitive and you end up with lazy weaklings dying and the strong and effective thriving.

Humans are supposed to be smart enough to understand this natural pendulum not to ignore it, but to keep it in balance so there are no massive swings. The bigger the swinging arc the greater the tragedy.

- Trump won the state in the Presidential election handily

- a look at how the early voters were [voting](https://i.imgur.com/C4ttNzt.jpg)

-  Trump rallied there numerous times, and we all know how much those rallies do.

-  the republican was leading until they shut down voting for the night, then way into the next day, two notoriously slow democrat areas finally report their votes and the Dems take the lead.  

-  Montana would theoretically be one of the easier states to cheat.  Very low population, means way less ballots to fill out and cheat with.

-  Montana is the one state that Trump made personal

-  Could they be using Florida and Arizona as bait to distract from where the real fraud is taking place?  Like drag out the Arizona and Florida investigations and get the media to focus on those, knowing they probably won't be able to flip them, but will get away with Montana scott free. 

- Is there a reason Montana is important?  I can't really think of anything that would motivate them to really want Montana.  The only possibility that comes to mind is if it had something to do with gambling.  Montana was a heavy favourite to be democrat, also the over/under for Senate seats held by Republicans was 52 (this theory may be a stretch, but I'm just posting it because it's something I noticed when I was looking at how Vegas was assessing the midterms before the election)

5200,">Definition of fascism 1 often capitalized : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual

See already that's wrong. The nation wasn't more important than the individual, the nation WAS the individual. Fascism says that the nation has no purpose without individuals, and that individuals have no purpose outside of the context of a nation. That's why its symbol is the Fasces. It's about unity of individuals for a common good. What makes Fascism right-wing and things like Practical Communism left-wing, are that it makes a distinction on WHO those individuals are and should be, while left-wing authoritarianism seeks a global structure. 

>a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control

That's LITERALLY just authoritarianism. I mean that could just as easily describe Monarchy, Feudalism, Tribalism, Globalism, Nazism, Communism and more. As I said in the other comment, people use the term ""Fascism"" as interchangeable with ""Authoritarianism"" - But they aren't synonymous.

> Nation above the good of the people is exactly what Obama preaches about gun control. We need to give up our individual rights for the good of the country

You're confusing ""nation"" and ""country"". Obama preached gun control for the good of the country, not the nation.  
A country is just a place under a certain management. A nation is the ideals, history and blood of a certain peoples. Gun Control would be good for the country, but terrible for the volk. That's why Mussolini didn't institute gun control, and Hitler himself laxed Gun Control laws for the German volk. In the examples where these rights were taken away, it was made explicitly clear the people it was being done to were considered enemies of the nation.  
Hitler thought the Jews were the nations enemies, so he disarmed them and let the people have guns. Obama wanted to disarm the populace and let only the politicians have guns - What does that tell you about the difference here?

>Don't mistake the their perceived desire for the good of the nation as the same way we see nationalism

Again, you're confusing ""nation"" and ""country"" They act in a desire for the good of the country, not the nation. Tearing down historical statues, saying you hate the native populace, those aren't ""good for the nation"". They're only good for a country they seek to create. 

>They want to open borders and let in Mexicans to do their dirty work like slaves so they can live like the Romans did

That's not the logic the left operates on at all - You misunderstand them at a fundamental level.  
The Romans were unashamedly Fascist before the term had even been invented. You know who else was? The Founding Fathers. The foundation that America was built on was modelled after the Romans. They opposed only the crowning of an Emperor out of the whole of Roman works, and even then only on principle. But look at all else - Their foreign policy, their immigration policy, their culture, their social policy, their economic policy, all of it is quite clearly modelled after Ancient Rome, which was as I said and you implied, unashamedly Fascist.  
The left doesn't want to get to that point, they want to absolve themselves of original sin. It just so happens that ""original sin"" in this case is ""privilege"". They believe we're doing well, and that wealth is evil, and thus we must rid ourselves of it. The left thinks people are equal (egalitarianism is inherently left-wing) and that society makes them inequal (the inverse is true for the right), and thus they want to change society until people are equal. They would rather we ALL be slaves, than only some people be slaves. 

>I don't know what about fascism doesn't ring of the left. 

I don't know man, maybe the part where Nationalism was a massive part of Fascism, the part where it explicitly opposed left-wing ideologies like Communism, the part where it made little-to-no attempt to interfere with natural hierarchy (the reaction to which is what defines left/right), the part where they would actually listen to the will of the people on cultural and social issues (Obama never cared what the people wanted with gun control, Mussolini backed off on pushing rice to the people when they made their distaste for the policy clear), and the parts where it explicitly encouraged strong in-group empathy but less out-group empathy.  

It's like equating theoretical Communism and Libertarianism - Both of them want the end of the expansive state, both of them want to be able to live in luxury at the expense of others, and both of them favor open borders. It's HOW and WHY they do those things that separates them, as it is with Fascism and left-wing Authoritarianism.",SoapAndLampshades,e9ofp12,The_Donald

Only the ones not paying close attention.

He overstepped in saying Hillary ""had no intent to break the law"" (paraphrased) and implying that she shouldn't be prosecuted, all publicly.  

He should have been fired that same day.

Intent for any regular federal employee or military member would only mitigate the level of punishment, not the prosecution for breaking the law.

He could determine speculation as to intent, and should have included that in his report to DOJ, not played prosecutor and judge/jury.

That kind of stunt was highly calculated to undermine lawful prosecution, knowing the government has a tendency to save face and issue a unified message.  In a just world, he'd be prosecuted as well.  As-is neither of them are likely to suffer any consequence, and that's less likely as time goes by.

Trump was 100% correct when he says this sort of shit has undermined the people's trust in these organizations, especially as McCabe also abused his position, plus all the leaks, conveniently deciding to end other investigations (eg Vegas Shooter), Strozk and his woman, etc.

I'm not even sure just putting in a great person at the head, DOJ and FBI chief, can get that back.  He'd have to do more than run it, he'd have to clean it the fuck out and whip them into action to demonstrate a renewed commitment to purpose.

Taking credit vicariously through local law enforcement and other offices for the sex abuse/trafficing busts isn't near enough to restore that lost trust.


Edit: That's not to say informed Rep's weren't grateful that Comey did do as much as he did.  Same way we're grateful for Pelosi, Waters, and will be for Alexandra Ocasi No Cortex.

Also: There's a time-line to consider.  Hey may have been considered ""a hero"" early on eg right after starting the Clinton investigation.  But for people paying attention, that should have changed as Comey came out with what I noted above.

Anyone running a private little outfit would be out of their mind not to hire me(not bragging, it’s fucking landscaping lol), but unfortunately they don’t even bat an eye my way because why hire me and pay me $15/hr when you can hire Mario at $8/hour to do the same job? It sucks for me but I don’t blame the people hiring them, I’d do the same thing if I owned a business.

The music industry basically took a singer who had something that was different:  I have no idea what she is really like, but at least her image was that of a normal, nice person.  Now they've turned her image into that same old wanna-be-artsy, science-fiction-ish look that has already been done so many times by popular music stars for decades now.  And she just had to become political too, so that's another way in which she is no longer something different.

Andersen, Margaret, and Patricia Hill Collins. Race, Class, & Gender: An anthology. Nelson Education, 2015:
> **The idea that objectivity is best reached only through rational thought is a specifically Western and masculine way of thinking** — one that we challenge throughout the book. Including personal narratives is not meant to limit our understanding only to individuals.

Acker, Joan, Kate Barry, and Joke Esseveld. “Objectivity and truth: Problems in doing feminist research.” In Women’s Studies International Forum, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 423–435. Pergamon, 1983:
>  **the assumption that the researcher must and can strive to be a neutral observer ... is made by many who use quantitative and qualitative methods in a natural science model. This assumption is challenged by the feminist critique** of social science that documents the male bias of theory and research which has previously been taken as a neutral account of human society. A feminist methodology must, therefore, deal with the issues of objectivity in social science and, in the process, deal also with the issue of the relationship between the researcher and the researched.

Ladson-Billings, Gloria, and William F. Tate, eds. Education research in the public interest: Social justice, action, and policy. Teachers College Press, 2006:
> …the alternative is not to give up the quest for objectivity in social science and education research. Rather, **the goal should be to reformulate and reconstruct objectivity** so that its formulation will involve the participation of scholar from diverse racial, ethnic, and gender groups

6709,"There is no reasonable argument that can be made to say that the party switch changed the sides viewpoints on race. Anyone who argues such is a fool. It really takes a fool to believe that the freeing of the slaves was because the north felt morally opposed to slavery and nothing else. The fact of the matter is that the north was arguably more racist than their southern counterparts. Mistreatment of African Americans by slaveholders was sparse. Because they saw slaves as an investment. States without slavery did not see them as equals. Far from it. The whole reason behind the civil war was that the north did not want slavery moving into the west and the south saw that as an attack on their livelihoods. But, the north's reasoning wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred the people who were slaves. They refused to live in close proximity with African Americans. At least, that was the case for the vast majority of the northern population. That's why tensions between white and black people increased dramatically after the civil war. Southerners felt they had been robbed of their livelihood and northerners couldn't stand to be around them. That's what led to segregation and things like the Jim crow laws. That's why you still see segregation in the north to this day. The north made it incredibly difficult for African Americans to ever move into their neighborhoods. Meanwhile, in the south you see far better dispersion of races throughout the community  You still see some small pockets of predominantly white or predominantly black communities but, they are typically smaller with less of a difference in crime and poverty levels.

It really could be said that just like the main viewpoint of the Republican Party looking out for big business didn't change, the Democrats views on African Americans hasn't really change. The old Democrats saw African Americans as nothing other than a monetary expenditure they could use as a tool to accomplish their goals. That's still the case, but the ways they control those people have simply changed. ",CrimsonChymist,e9arboi,The_Donald
9301,"> **Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes was recently assisted by two organizations financed by billionaire activist George Soros in response to a lawsuit from a conservative group accusing her of maintaining inaccurate voter rolls.**

> **Last March, a judge ruled that Snipes had implemented a “reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of death or change of address.” The ruling came in response to a 2017 case in which the American Civil Rights Union used data it had collected about population, age and citizenship to claim that Snipes was failing to take steps to maintain accurate voter rosters.**

> **Notably, the intervener in the case on Snipes’ behalf was the SEIU union’s United Healthcare Workers East, which was represented on the matter by lawyers from Demos and Project Vote, both of which are funded by Soros. An intervener allows a non-party to join an ongoing lawsuit.**

14834,"In early voting, it's 42%-41% Republicans. Polls usually assume about 6% more Democrats will vote this year, so it would be a huge surprise if it continued this way. Republicans can lose by 5% and still hold the House (gerrymandering, Democrats being concentrated in big cities), so winning by 1% would mean holding virtually all our seats and getting 55+ in the Senate.

The thing is, Democrats were winning in early voting in 2014 and then ended up losing. So the evidence indicates election day results are usually more Republican than early voting, meaning there is a very plausible argument that we can expect Republicans to win by MORE than 1%, which could mean gaining seats in both Houses.

Acts of Congress have extended consent to limited sets of circumstances, most notably some tortious and contract claims. However, even in the event that the federal government can be sued, the target of the suit is the government itself, not its individual agents. Executive immunity further articulates that the immunity of the executive in the course of his duties is absolute.

You can sue the president for conduct carried out prior to his inauguration, or which is genuinely independent of the presidential office, but CNN cannot validly sue the president when he is acting on the authority of the office of the president.

The goal was to avoid allowing in so many people so fast that it altered our national character. Hart-Celler was put in place in '65 based in part on what were later admitted lies - that altering immigration policy to the mess we have now wouldn't alter the population. America was about 88% white in 1965. It was about 89% white in 1910. In 2010, it was 72% white. So the US was essentially a white nation with a black minority (always making up around 10-13% of the population) and then after 1965's disastrous changes to immigration law, we've begun to lose that character at a dangerously rapid pace.

Soros is a heartless financier who deals in financial manipulation behind a broad strategy of societal destabilization.

Even if western countries are swarmed by low IQ anti-semites and the light of western civilization goes out, he will cackle to the grave playing with the still burning embers of what was. 

He’s the puppet master behind Marxism. The war profiteer, the calamity causer. His well funded minions burrow in a million tunnels through our sacred structures. Our families, our religions, our nations. Undermining everything. 

Soros despises family, culture, heritage, anything that represents a strength he does not control. Our love for one another is our shield. Reject Marxism!

More accurately it alters your neurotransmitter (and neuropeptide) systems associated with both reward and stress reduction functions.  Easiest way to explain that is it makes the drug more attractive while it reduces your ability to manage stress. Well hey they are junkies so who cares...let’s just ignore the fact that opiates were (and still are) incredibly overperscribed. Current reccomendation for prescribing opiates is three or fewer days. Three days...each day after that increases your chance of forming a “habit”. Yet this class is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for pain management!? 

 The “safety” in this policy is to create an environment that can reduce overdose deaths.  It’s a sad but necessary step now that we have a public health epidemic on our hands. One way or another tax payers are going to pay for this problem, it’s too big a problem now.

[We must] “find and travel the road from individualism to socialism without revolution”.

“If we are socialists, then we must definitely be anti-semites – How, as a socialist, can you not be an anti-semite?”

And Joseph Goebbels, who was in charge of NAZI propaganda, communication and branding, said:

""I can love Germany and hate capitalism. Not only can I, I must. Only the annihilation of a system of exploitation carries with it the core of the rebirth of our people.""

There were more Tump voters in California than any other state. Millions. 

This could happen to your state, I know for a fact that wherever you are, this is the plan for you, and when it happens I'm not going to advocate for throwing the baby out with the bathwater because I know better.

I used to fish in a stream everyday after school for trout (can't anymore, the commies have found ways to stop that), hunt the days I didn't fish (now public property and onerous laws block much of that) and have shot all my life (the gun grabbers are trying to stop that too). 

You support a military that frees people trapped in oppressive foreign lands while saying your fellow Americans trapped in this commie plan to overthrow Americas sovereignty should burn to the ground. No matter where you live and what policies your voter fraud induced overlords may place onto you, I would NEVER turn my back on a Patriot. 

Think about that for a minute, and know that while we have been praying, they have been PREYING, and it could happen to you before you even realize what is happening.

Fast-forward to March 2014, the Californian Republican Party rejected the color red in favor of blue as the official party color.

He knew, Broward’s Debbie Noodles will just cheat their ass off for him. 

How much more sinister and sickening all of this is, when you realized all the high level Floridan Dems are in on this shit. Now come to think of it, why would Andrew Guilin, a progressive Libtard, endorse and campaign with Debbie Noodles, who is a Neo-Lib Clinton style Democrat? They’re the opposite end of the D-spectrum and many of Andrew’s core supporters, the most fired up ones- the millennials, pounded him for being close to that controversial, tattered figure.

17347,"While I can understand what you're trying to say, there's a point when on the carrot on a stick, the string will snap. Expand too much, and the military will be spread too thin, which can lead to things like trade routes being compromised, people beginning to rebel as the country can't protect them properly, and then a whole downwards spiral.

Rome couldn't continue expanding forever, because internal problems are going to start popping up no matter what you do. The Romans often had to deal with uprisings all through their expansion, which they had to deal with first, before they began to lose what they earned, either in territory or wealth. As they grew larger and larger, more and more uprisings started occurring, the corruption got worse, and Romans lost their cause. 

There must be a fine balance between the two, I think. Overcommitting aggressive behavior can leave you vulnerable to the threats lying inside. If you keep pushing the wall outwards without looking at what the people trapped inside are thinking, then you're going to have a problem eventually.

This is about media organizations knowingly spreading false information in order to reach a particular outcome. This is not about freedom of the press as POTUS has had a much more open administration than his predecessors. If this was truly about freedom of the press then they would have spoken up when Obama was wiretapping journalists. ,PoliticalMadness1515,e9ntudk,The_Donald

I wasn't.

1950,"The Berlin Wall stood as a harrowing barrier for nearly three decades, dividing East and West Germans from their families and friends, and symbolizing the suffocating oppression of Soviet-backed totalitarian regimes.  On World Freedom Day, we remember the struggle and sacrifice of those who braved severe hardships under communism’s brutal reign, and we celebrate November 9, 1989, as the day when freedom-loving people on both sides of the wall came together to begin tearing down this hated obstruction to liberty.  We also honor the unwavering resolve of those who confronted the evils of corrupt despots and reaffirm our support for people around the world seeking to live in freedom and to enjoy the blessings of liberty.

As of this year, Germany has been reunified for longer than it was divided by the Berlin Wall, which imprisoned the people of East Germany for more than 28 years.  While it stood, the Berlin Wall was both a physical barrier and a symbol of oppression.  Few dared to dream of reunification.  The courageous and unwavering determination of those who dared to confront it and those who guarded it day and night, however, inspired millions to prove that freedom prevails over tyranny.  The fall of the Berlin Wall marked a major step in the disintegration of the Iron Curtain, paving the way to the liberation of Eastern and Central Europe from the grip of communism and marking a decisive victory for freedom-loving people across Europe.  Many countries that lived under the shadow of communism emerged as new democracies and reclaimed their right to determine their own futures.  Today, they continue to defend their cherished independence.

Unfortunately, we know freedom is repressed in too many places around the world, particularly where terrorism and extremism continue to pose grave threats.  Americans have always held boldly and unapologetically to the truth that liberty is an inherent human right, and we reaffirm our commitment to keeping the light of freedom burning bright and shining out to the entire world.

Today, we pay tribute to the brave individuals who, despite all risks, have challenged injustice and fought for freedom, especially those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.  We stand in solidarity with those who still live under tyrannical governments and emphasize that the world will be better off when all governments respect the right of all people to live in freedom.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2018, as World Freedom Day.  I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming our dedication to freedom and democracy.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this
eighth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.

We need to actively promote and encourage their assimilation to American values and ethics. Promoting strong families, communities, schools, jobs, and stability. 

Secondly Repubs need to level up their salesmanship of the good things that are demonstrably happening because of strong performance in the former point. 

Too often the Repubs get limp on selling their success as why they are a better option than the Dems model of victim status oppression olympics, and how raising taxes and more welfare is the answer. 

We’ll know it’s working when families are more whole (less single parent households/ less abortion/etc), education levels rise, family worth goes up, and employment in their community remains low. 

Just a top down glance but those are major areas i’d focus on. 

Families of foreign origin not taking the American opportunity to thrive in reasonable time should have their status rescinded and be humanely deported. I don’t feel we have time or resources to pander to half arsed Quasi-American wannabes.

4262,"Whitaker is presently  only a very temporary stop gap , he will not be able to do anything of any consequence because he was not properly appointed and does not  qualify under the present laws to be appointed,he has not even been Sworn in.This has been known for months by people who actually take a interest in politics not just believe everything they see on Idiot Book and will now soon become the focus of the left.If it was necessary to rush him in to keep a loyal eye on what is happening inside that is a bad sign, if he is there to make smooth transition for Rosenstein leaving it is better ,but then shows how bad the long rumored  disloyalty within the Dept is,there is really no other reason to sacrifice a loyal soldier this way as he will be attacked.

Lets be clear only people with no knowledge of politics did not see Whitaker coming, he has been a major Blip on the GOP radar since he  was the co-chair of Rick Perry's 2012 Presidential Campaign.The President had Sessions appoint him after he did a media sweep ""Bird Dogging"" (making his strong opinions known as a bargaining tool/threat).The President also made a point of  publicly singling him out for praise rather than Sessions during his time under Sessions and the President is well known months ago  to have had him on the short list for the White House Counsel position such is the Presidents admiration for his work.

The President was urged again back when the Rosenstein taping clusterfuck was exposed to use that to justifiably sack Rosenstein ,using that as the premise to THEN LEGALLY QUALIFY the appointment of  Whitaker  which would then make the appointment legally binding under the laws.Once again either the White House Admin has fucked up or they chose to waste the opportunity of appointing him  the only proper way available to them (no way with his previous public stance the Dems or RINO's would confirm him)because Rosenstein has flipped and needs to stay in position.

Sessions PRE WRITTEN AND UNDATED resignation letter (what is known as a Top Drawer poison pill, as that is where it is kept till needed in return for letting the subject fade away with no legal/investigation consequences, a common Swamp and Law enforcement  tactic) without Rosenstein doing the same or being attacked at the same time IMO comes down to 2 things, White House Cluster fuck in dealing with a Swamp critter or Rosenstein has flipped which explains the change of language after the unusual Air Force One trip and abilty to blow off subpoenas with no consequence from the White House (remember Sessions was allowed to do the same just days ago) .

504,"""America is a country of liberty. A meeting of immigrants. Instead of simply assimilating, its citizens live along side others. Their roots are varied. Diverse. America's never been made up of just one people. But he tried to forge a single consciousness. For it, and from it. The idea that every citizen would use free will to unite behind their country... Unilateralism like that can't be entrusted to any one individual. So the major sought a system which used information, words, to control the 'subconscious'.

""To unite America and the entire world. The major thought this was his friend's will. But I think he never understood what she wanted. Before he ever walked, or cried - even before he was born - his mother tongue was English. He doesn't know the pain of losing his own language. Not yet. He cannot understand her will. I do. I was born in a small village. I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers. Foreign soldiers. Torn from my elders, I was made to speak their language. With each new post, my masters changed, along with the words they made me speak. Words are... peculiar. With each change, I changed too. My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong... War changed me - and not only my visage. Words can kill. I was invaded by words, burrowing and breeding inside me. A philosopher once said, 'It is no nation we inhabit, but a language.' 'Make no mistake, our native tongue is our true fatherland.' My fatherland - my truth was stolen from me. And so was my past. All that's left is the future. And mine is revenge. On those who'd leech off the words of their fellow man. This is what I learned from the major. And then it hit me. It was he who should feel my wrath. He and the code he chose as basis for control. Language codes, information codes - beamed all around us - genetic codes spanning history. By controlling the codes, Cipher... Zero intends to unify the world. Codes implanted into our heads, sucking our minds dry as it spreads from one host to the next. A parasite upon the earth. That is what Zero is. As one born into this world, he's afflicted. I hold him responsible for killing my freedom. Killing all traces of my past... Killing any promise of a future... We are all but dead men forced to walk upon this earth. A world reduced to Zero. Cipher plans to use its codes to control the world. They think they can.""",NScorpion,e9oglmw,The_Donald

> **Deputy District Attorney Marian Thompson of the Public Integrity Division said five of nine defendants are expected to be arraigned this morning in Department 30 of the Foltz Criminal Justice Center.**

> **The charges include circulating a petition with false names; use of false names on a petition; voter fraud, registering a fictitious person; and voter fraud, registering a nonexistent person. Case BA472537 was filed for arrest warrant on Nov. 1.**

> **The defendants are accused of engaging in the solicitation of hundreds of false and/or forged signatures on state ballot petitions and voter registration forms by allegedly offering homeless people $1 and/or cigarettes for their participation, prosecutors said. The alleged offenses occurred during the 2016 and 2018 election cycles.**

> **State officials said petition signature scams aren’t widespread in California, but Joseph said they do pop up from time to time on skid row. People hired to help qualify initiatives for the ballot are often paid per signature collected, typically $1 to $2, but officials said a recent slew of proposed ballot initiatives had pushed the rate as high as $6 a signature.

10578,"It's not a big deal as in ""assault"", and the play is probably to make it seem that way and use the liberals own tatics against them.

But from the Whitehouse level they merely said that a reporter putting a hand on a woman doing her job is wrong.

And there is where I think is the ""big deal"" enough to lose credentials.

We all know the press game, where reports keep trying to ask questions and presidents moving on.  HOWEVER, a reporter should never push away the arm of a woman trying to do her job to pass on the mic to the next reporter. That is what goes further than the normal press game and which I feel is enough to warrant him losing his credentials.",portablespeaker,e99sj0a,The_Donald

Whilst the people of her state were burning this cow was having a comfy diner with her good mates. Couple this with the infestation of greens/socialists in local councils specifically in the inner city and subsequently in state politics, you've got a state whose populace is at the mercy of these civilisational vandals. None of them have to deal with the consequences of their batshit experiment, they're not the ones who live amongst the sudanese or muslims.

10498,"I remember it clearly. It was the catalyst behind Ben Shapiro leaving Breitbart and ultimately exposing himself for the neocon that he is. Honestly, that was one of Shapiro's stupidest moments.

For the record, I like some of the things Shapiro says and think he's undeniably a force for good in the world that the likes of Cenk Ogre or David Pacman will never be. But Shapiro's a neocon nonetheless, and his ideological framework doesn't exactly align with mine, nor with that of many of my fellow Trump populists. 

But yeah, I'm glad Lewandowski is still kicking it. And I'm glad that, as with Kavanaugh, the truth prevailed and both men were vindicated from the duplicitous, vile, and baseless lies thrown at them by a hysterical mob and crooked media apparatus. ",iGouger,e9a79w4,The_Donald
