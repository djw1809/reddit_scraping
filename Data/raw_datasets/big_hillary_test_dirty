4922,"I miss Comey showing some regret for his harsh comments on Hillary when he announced the FBI closed the investigation. He clearly broke the protocol and I believe it was his ego doing it. However, Loretta Lynch should've recused herself and hand the case down to Sally Yates. But that doesn't excuse Comey.

He explained his decision to reveal the reopening of Clinton investigation but to keep quiet about the investigation into the Russia's meddling with the elections and possible links to the Trump campaign. I still believe that he should've included a warning about the foreign adversary's attempts to disrupt the election and possibly swing it to Trump, thus making his letter about the current state of the play. Chaffetz would've though twice whether to leak it or not. Maybe that would've started a much needed conversation about the meddling, fake stories, Russian trolls and cyberwar.

5026,"My main issue is there doesn't seem to be respect for other opinions or an understanding of where they come from, and I mean that in a very broad sense. I randomly checked in here, don't think I've been here since 2016, and I was surprised by the tweet. I didn't think Hillary was still active politically and I didn't know this sub was active either. 



This post reached r/all, and I saw a comment that was basically the same reaction I had to seeing it. Then I saw it was getting downvoted, and the user I've been going back and forth with was being very personal and hostile toward that person. It reminded me of the general feeling I've always had when I come here. I unsubbed a long time ago because the culture here is actually kind of toxic. So I said something along those lines. 


I notice the same things in r/politics. So many conservatives have liberal stances when you question them in a way that doesn't trigger them. So many of them are looking for the door. But they feel unwelcome by liberals, because there is an endless stream of shaming and ridicule toward them. This approach will never persuade anyone. It drives people to entrench themselves. If you want people to join you, you have to respect where they currently are and seek common ground and common goals, then maybe if you're lucky the differences will become common ground too. For such a prominent political figure it's always struck me as bizarre how exclusive and hostile her subreddit is. 


Liberals seem so convinced that they have the moral and intellectual high ground that they're oblivious to how they are perceived and how much they alienate potential allies. I don't care about mean comments from internet strangers. It was annoying for maybe a few minutes. I care about unifying the lower and middle classes. Projection and lack of mutual respect is a pervasive issue and a major obstacle to that. I commented because of the condescending hostility I saw toward another user for having the wrong reaction to the post. This sub and this public figure got some rare visibility on this site and screwed it up. It makes Hillary and liberals look bad. I think a lot of people have checked in here and decided not to stick around. There's no reason why Hillary couldn't have a  comparable presence to Bernie on this site. I think this sub, and liberals in general, shoot themselves in the foot. ",scrumtrellescent,dy4w2lo,hillaryclinton

The small states wouldn't have joined without assurances that they would continue to have a say in how the nation is run. For example, the New Jersey delegation's proposal had the President elected by a Congress where each state received one equal vote. The drafters of the Connecticut compromise (basically the system we have today) was very well aware that the electoral college it created would serve to ensure a geographically diverse national support for a presidential candidate. 

It serves that purpose quite well. If you imagine an election with two presidential candidates, where each gets 50% +1 votes in each state they win, the most lopsided scenario possible where one candidate wins the electoral vote without the popular vote still has the winner earning 49.6% of the vote.

Just look at all the benefit of the doubt Ivanka Trump gets. She's apparently against separating children from parents if you listen to the press. Yet she hasn't said one word publicly. They are going off a so-called conservation she had in private with Trump. Same with Melania. 

We should fight this perception of liberal bias and counter these narratives with questions. Instead we try to get rid of strong voices.

Hillary helped raise 500,000 recently. She can do more in her capacity and so can the Obama's. Just because they are perceived as toxic doesn't mean we bow down to the Republicans.

3661,">  Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 

No, where do you read that out? It says, that not everyone who is from a minority is automatically progressive. Thats why I gave you some examples, almost no left-leaning liberal would prefer a female/latina/black republican over a male/white/heterosexual (progressive) democrat. 

>  Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 

It might be that he thinks a lot more in terms of class than other politicians do (if they do it at all) because he says he is a socialist. But still he made clear quite a lot that racial and gender justice is really important (to him).

> Bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative.

Come on.. I am pretty sure Bernie knew Hillary Clinton from their time in Senate together.. 

> Maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a Latina woman.

He could have done that. But I don't know the centext.. I have searched for quite a bit but didn't found an article with the full question but I found one with the full (long) answer. Yes, he could simply have asked what she wants to change or whats to do and when she replied he could than have said ""okay, thats great"" or ""yeah, thats not enough"". But what he could also have done is say that it is really important go get enough minoritiy candidates into politics but they also have to be progressives. I don't see a problem there. (Even tough his statement beginns with ""Let me respond to the question in a way you may not be happy with"", so its probably more than ""I want to be the first latina.."" but a real question)

> You're the one, like Bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing.

Where am I beeing very arrogant? And where am I reducing identity politics as a negative thing?

> I mean Bernie called her unqualified and his campaign manager branded her ""ambitious"" because she wanted to run for president.

Bernie replied to her, when she said that Bernie didnt do his homework and that doesnt understand how to break up big banks and voters should ask themselves if he can deliver what he promises. Then Bernie just replied ""Theyre going to question my qualifications, so I am questioning theirs."" And he repeated the same in a debate (""you might wonder about your qaulifications Madame Secretary"". And then he said why he is questioning them: Iraq war, trade agreements, super PACs, Wall Street. Yes, this might be a bit childish (Bernie said that ""we"" shouldnt get into that tit-for-tat) but I dont think its sexist. 

It is basically ""being a women is not enough"" because you have to stand up against big banks and not take their money. And the ""ambitious"" thing is actually another context.. but okay, I am not here to say that every member of the campaign is perfect. But its a bit far-fetched to say that Bernie reduced Clinton to her identity because his campaign manager says, that she has ambitions to be president... thats basically a fact for (nearly) every candidate.

> He dismissed Trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction.

No he said that this is shameful and its probably not against Clinton but this would be against all women. A quote of the interview: ""Maybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing America. Donald Trump will not look quite so interesting in that context."" He is not saying, that abortion rights are not important (which is insane to say if you know his voting record and his engagement for women rights.

> And then there's his hardcore supporters coming after Hillary supporters as vagina voters.

And then there is the hardcore supporters of Hillary coming after Bernie supporters (but again Bernie supporters /=/ Bernie) who say that there is a special place in hell for women who dont support Clinton. Or that young women support Bernie because they want to meet boys. Or all the ""Bernie Bros"" that just support Bernie because he is a man. 

> when he ran against a female governor of Vermont he made it about her gender and how it would be sexist to vote for her because she was a woman

I dont know about the time, that was before I was born. What he said though is that many people are excited because she is a women but there is nothing more (because) he is the bigger feminist. I just dont know if that is true. But yeah, it would be sexist to vote for Bernie if they just do it because he is a men. It is not (really) sexists to prefer a women over a men if you like them equally.",Bermany,e2puvkr,hillaryclinton

1831,"Hey, you keep editing and deleting your comments - it's kind of hard to have a genuine conversation with someone who does that.

Where have I made assumptions about you? Politics is always personal... I don't think I've insulted you - I'm going by the comments you have made - if you take that personally then maybe you shouldn't be engaging in these discussions and then feel offended.

And yes Bernie has everything to do with this - you talk about AOC and populism and dismiss Hillary's primary win - it's not really hard to see what you're implying here. This has everything to do with Bernie.

>(such as Joe Biden, who tried to jump in in October '15 after his grieving process concluded, until party leaders up to and including Obama warned him they'd rake him over the coals. Again, not the typical experience of a candidate. Which brings us to Nita Lowey's experience in 2000, another case of red carpet treatment).

And again, all of this is false. Party leaders and Obama didn't tell him not to run because they'd rake him over the coals... that's completely false. Firstly that was not the reason and secondly neither obama or any party leader was part of his decision and he's spoken about this. So it's curious where you're getting these ""facts"" from? And if you read his book, you'll see that he and Hillary had discussed running against each other and were okay with it as long as they didn't run negative campaigns against each other. Again, these are facts not ""establishment/party"" conspiracies which you keep trying to imply.

And also about Lowey's experience - she dropped out and was even supporting Hillary for the seat before she dropped out.  It's not red carpet treatment at all. This is what people who support their party do. Also by this logic, the party would have probably not Bernie run since he was an independent but of course that's not true because it's not the party at play here. 

You seem to be insinuating that Hillary was gifted all her elections - can you say that about her re-election to the Senate? And if she had a red carpet treatment how did they let Obama run against her in 2008? And if that was the case then why did they let Bernie and all the rest of the dem nominees run against her in 2016? 

This is nothing personal but if you're engaging in a discussion and make some clearly false claims then be expect to be questioned. You clearly have a fixed perception of Hillary which has emerged through your comments and it has nothing to do with her policies. You're in a Hillary sub... like why are you offended if someone calls you out on it?

And just for the sake of it... you would have preferred Biden to run? According to what you've said, how exactly would he have been different as president with a GOP house and senate?

2068,"So last night I cut my ankle while taking out the trash.  I'm not even sure what did it, all I know is that I felt liquid on my ankle and looked down, and sure enough, it was bleeding.  So I went inside and tried to clean it off.  The blood kept coming.  In fact, it took me an hour to stop the bleeding, and even once the bleeding stopped, every time I so much as walked across the room, I started bleeding again.  After another hour of that, I went to the ER.  Again, I was humiliated at the ER by my blood leaking and my shoe being drenched in blood as I walked from my uber to check in.  I spent four hours waiting in an exam room.  Turned out I needed stitches - which I suspected when the bleeding wasn't stopping.  They also did a tetanus shot since we don't know what caused the bleeding and some blood work to make sure nothing was infected.

5741,"There's a case to be made. HW had only four years in the House compared to Hillary's eight in the Senate. Being RNC Chair is a political job that doesn't translate much to the Presidency. Bush is generally considered to edge her out on foreign policy - but he only spent two years at the UN, one at the CIA, and just over a year in China, so arguably four years as Sec State (which is more involved in policy-making) is at least a match for that.

HW probably wins out overall because he was Vice-President (and a very active one in Reagan's later years in office) which has a similar sort of general advisory role as Hillary's tenure as First Lady, but is more formal and powerful.

There's been a lot of that.  Trump really fucked with the fabric of our nation.  My grandmother had been going to the same church for twenty years, after the election her ministers sent a letter to the whole congregation discussing how elated they were to finally have a Christian (Pence) in the White House. That same day my grandmother wrote a letter back, outlining the importance of the word of Christ, the 10 Commandments, and how little her ministers knew about what it means to be Christian.  
  
I'm pretty sure they got a lot of letters like that, because she got another letter next week, begging her and everyone else to come back.

1659,"You make a fair point about this essay - a lot of people post it without context or explanation and it's sort of become a meme for people who don't like Bernie but it's definitely not to trigger past traumas - it's more about pointing out the  hypocrisy surrounding him especially from his most ardent supporters who refuse to address his past in any way.

And in terms of relevance to this post -actually it is very relevant to both the post and the OP's comment especially if you read his full essay and understand what he's saying about gender roles (which the NPR article does not). 

His essay is a perfect example of how women face different standards from men. How they're judged differently from men.  And this comes out in his essay not from what he says about women but how he says it. He focuses on the woman who fantasizes about being subjugated. He focuses on the woman about choosing different parts of her self and soul. He doesn't apply that same standard to the men. That says a lot.

People were (and evidently still are) bad at reading them.

The national polls predicted that Clinton would win the popular vote by 3% and she won by 2%.

The state levels polls in the Midwest showed her having a small lead but being one small systematic error away from losing.  This is why Fivethirtyeight, which relies mostly (albeit not entirely) on polling, concluded that Clinton had a 70% chance of winning. That conclusion still seems right, given that 60,000 total flipped votes  between MI, PA, and WI could have turned the election the other way.

Whatever your political affiliations, it seems to me only reasonable for the POTUS, the **First Citizen**, the **Princeps**, should be someone who tries to set a good example of how a person should behave.

Take Mike Pence.  I'm a Liberal, I cannot stand the mans policies.  However, after the #MAGABOMBER attacks he *immediately* came to the defense of the targeted victims.  He behaved with a degree of grace and dignity that made me respect him.  Our retired POTUS 43 was, IMO, a headache in office.  However, he behaved and *behaves* in a manner that inspires respect and emulation.

Our current POTUS is a toxic influence who inspires anti-Semites, Misogynists and Racists to murderous and bloody action.  He **must** go, and swiftly, or, it seems to me, the U.S.A. will descend into an even bloodier state of civil strife **that it is already in**.

If you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.  I didn’t say white men are oppressed and I won’t say their privileged either, they live a human life.  The homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him he’s privileged and that’s why you won’t give him any money.

Even Trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  If white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.

A year ago I moved from Oklahoma to Los Angeles.  The two cultures are so vastly different.  The Democratic Party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country that’s why we are where we are at.  In Oklahoma where I was apart of the Democratic Party, the Hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in Oklahoma as sexist and say that’s why they wouldn’t vote for Clinton but at the very same time we had a female Republican governor running the state.  Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Arizona and many other “Red” states have had female governors while states like New York and California have not.

It’s not about privilege, race or gender it’s about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.  Sad to say but Democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican (Trump  is not average).  Obama brought people together Clinton divided.

676,"Hillary delivered some pretty critical commentary towards the administration lately and she might be anticipating that her own security clearance will be revoked as a consequence, like former CIA director (and frequent Trump critic) John Brennan's was. When that happened, it dominated the news cycle for awhile. Plus, the President revoking security clearances because he disagrees with them politically is not something that was done before Trump.

My interpretation of this is that Hillary would rather voluntarily give up her security clearance rather than having it *revoked* because 1) revocation would create a bigger news story, the press would rehash 2016, and more important issues would be ignored and 2) she doesn't want to take part in establishing this new precedent of the President revoking security clearances for people he doesn't like. She wants to limit the ability of Trump to politicize the security clearance process.",secretlovesong,e7p91wt,hillaryclinton

5543,"Bernie refused to endorse her until mid-July, months after he was mathematically eliminated. He called Hillary Clinton unqualified to be president, and lied that she had made the same comment about him, after he suffered a bad loss in early April. The primary was -over- in April, but Bernie still tried to attack Clinton. Then in JUNE, he offered to debate Donald Trump on live television (again, after Hillary was the presumptive nominee... all Bernie wanted to do was give himself, and Donald Trump, some more of the spotlight).

His supporters then protested the convention, booed over Elizabeth Warren, chanted ""NO TPP"" over Barack Obama, booed Marcia Fudge, booed civil rights leaders, booed Sarah Silverman when she said ""Bernie or Bust"" is ridiculous. They literally attempted to eat beans and simultaneously fart to clear the building (yes, this actually happened https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/sanders-fans-plan-dnc-fart-protest-clinton-nomination-n611596)

Sanders enabled that behavior by making his most volatile supporters his delegates. They even booed *HIM* when he said to elect Clinton (https://youtu.be/rTH6YdbM-WA). He created this monster and never tamed it or took responsibility. He never condemned their actions toward Roberta Lange, he never condemned them throwing dollar bills at Hillary's motorcade as if she was a stripper, he thanked a man for introducing him at a rally after that same mad had just called Hillary Clinton a ""whore"" in his introduction.

Even in Bernie's own speech, he doesn't mention Hillary Clinton until ~12 minutes into the speech (aside from one throwaway line 'This election is not about Hillary Clinton'). Compare that to Hillary's 2008 convention speech when the first thing she does is giving a ringing endorsement of Barack Obama and helps redirect her supporters' passion and enthusiasm to him.",JodySalerno,dxeaaot,hillaryclinton

She is genuinely looked up to by millions of Americans. She is a role model for women (and not just women) around the world. She has the loyalty of extremely influential political groups because she has been a proven ally for decades.

Besides, that 1/3rd you're talking about are not who we need to be speaking to. They shouldn't be part of our conversation. It's not our job to heal the nation and bring everyone together.

Finally, it wasn't *somehow* that the country elected the other guy. It was an unprecedented series of headwinds. The FBI/Comey's bullshit. Russian disinformation campaigns. Cable news' infatuation with Trump. Misogyny. And yes she wasn't perfect too but the idea that there is ""just something about her"" is a Fox News invention. There are reasons the polls moved so dramatically in the last few weeks. Primarily it was Comey but also the conspiracy theories about her health and the way news networks failed.

Those things could have just as easily applied to other candidates.

https://twitter.com/LisaTalmadge/status/891714303438532608

It shows how Hillary was always there for us, how she worked behind the scenes, showed support for Aids patients (which Sanders NEVER did), showed up in lgtb parades (which Sanders never did) and how she worked to advance lgtb rights in her time as  SOS.

About POC:
you can start by reading this excellent thread by MrWeeks, documenting Hillary's life long commitment to the cviil rights movement:

But stating Hillary defended the status quo, when in fact she was there for us for 30+ years or even worse: saying she wasn't a champion for women, makes you a first class asshole.

Confirmation bias is universal, y' know?  

So I decided to check it out.  This synopsis is courtesy of Hamilton 68:  
  
>*[The #walkaway movement, a campaign highlighting alleged discord among the left, got a boost this week from accounts linked to Russian influence operations. The first use of the #walkaway hashtag from accounts monitored on Hamilton 68 was noted in early June (a few weeks after the grassroots campaign began), but engagement remained relatively low throughout the month. Activity spiked on July 2, when Hamilton 68 noted 73 unique tweets using #walkaway, and roughly another 50 using related campaign hashtags (e.g. #walkawaymovement). The late engagement suggests Kremlin-oriented accounts are trailers rather than leaders of the campaign, but the high-level of current engagement indicates an effort to astroturf support for the movement and hijack the narrative. This includes several monitored accounts that have changed their handles to include the hashtag, or that have shared their own supposed walkaway moments. The campaign also received a direct boost from Russian propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik, both of which ran stories on the movement.](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/)*   
  
Keep your eyes out for attempts to divide our movement, and our party, in ways both blatant and subtle.  *We lost the 2016 by 80,000 votes,* less than a football stadium, we can't afford to be at anything less than full strength this year.  A moment's foray into r/WalkAway should tell the average user everything they need to know about the movement.
  
If you see someone using WalkAway talking points around social media, take the time to disarm them.  I'm still hearing people talking about the ""rigged primaries,"" a talking point that was [disproven](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/14/16640082/donna-brazile-warren-bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-rigged), so either Russia is playing its greatest hits, or people still believe it, or both.  
  
Our enemies will be pushing back at us just as hard as they did in 2016, and if they're smart they'll push back *even harder* now that they have an entire political party on their side, but we know what we're looking for, and how to defend against it.

I think it's fair to say that she is _less_ experienced than other potential candidates. She's certainly less experienced than Cuomo, who's had the job for almost eight years. But that's hardly the same thing as no experience; a governor works in advocacy, policy, and management. She's had decades of experience and is well respected in each of those areas. The most relevant attack you can use against her is lack of _breadth_ of experience, rather than depth, because until her candidacy she's been mostly laser focused on education policy.

2092,"A white man’s life is different depending on the city, state and region you live in and economics plays a huge role.  If you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.  I didn’t say white men are oppressed and I won’t say their privileged either, they live a human life.  The homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him he’s privileged and that’s why you won’t give him any money.

Even Trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  If white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.

A year ago I moved from Oklahoma to Los Angeles.  The two cultures are so vastly different.  The Democratic Party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country that’s why we are where we are at.  In Oklahoma where I was apart of the Democratic Party, the Hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in Oklahoma as sexist and say that’s why they wouldn’t vote for Clinton but at the very same time we had a female Republican governor running the state.  Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Arizona and many other “Red” states have had female governors while states like New York and California have not.

It’s not about privilege, race or gender it’s about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.  Sad to say but Democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican (Trump  is not average).  Obama brought people together Clinton divided.  We all lost when her campaign started dividing people and it started long before Trump got the Republican nomination.",MachoMug,e47k56u,hillaryclinton

**Exhibit B: Russia's hacking of voter rolls**

""They penetrated voter rolls in at least 39 states. And we know from what the Senate Intelligence Committee said that in a small number of states, but possibly pivotal number of states, they changed the voter rolls, potentially disenfranchising Clinton voters who might have showed up to the polls and found out that they were not registered to vote.""

**~ ~ ""All of these things add up quickly in an election that was decided by fewer than 80,000 votes in three states."" ~ ~**

**Exhibit C: Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign** 

""The Russians began leaking these massive dumps of stolen emails through WikiLeaks on the eve of the Democratic convention, and the story line that emerged from those stolen emails was the the DNC was biased against Bernie Sanders. And then the next big tranche of documents was released, very significantly, 29 minutes after the Washington Post reported on the Access Hollywood video in which Donald Trump was heard bragging about grabbing woman by their genitals. And so that last-minute intervention by the Russians via WikiLeaks was incredibly important, which is why Donald Trump mentioned WikiLeaks 164 times in the last month of the campaign. 

~ ~""Nobody would suggest that the Russian intervention was the only factor behind the election outcome, but if you talk to experts like **former FBI agent Clint Watts, what he will tell you is that if it were not for the Russian intervention, Donald Trump would not have been within even striking distance of Hillary Clinton.**

3034,"Her campaign in the general didn't advertise in the Rust Belt until days before she lost to Trump. Her advertising in the general almost totally ignored policy, and the vast majority of her ads almost exclusively focused on ad-hominem attacks and Trumps unfitness for office. Which no other political campaign in advertising history has done to the degree her campaign did.

Trumps campaign, in contrast, stuck to a more traditional advertising strategy of comparing and contrasting policy.

So considering the vast, vast majority of Sanders voters voted for Hillary in the general I think I'm gonna have to point more towards a bad general campaign and a historically weird advertising strategy than anything involving Sanders as a primary cause of her loss.

They should of just stuck with the tried and true method of compare and contrast advertising like she did in the primary against Sanders. But instead they gambled on a novel advertising strategy against Trump, and lost.

I know if seems impossible to consider at this moment in time, but assuming that particular groups of people will vote the same way and at the same rates for all time is a mistake.

I was also surprised at the level of contradiction, or declaration of intent about gerrymandering in California. There is a good argument that California is too big and it's constituents would be better served if was broken apart. Then David mentioned that his redrawing of the map would include 7 states that would have all voted for Clinton by a good margin. That is pretty hard to do when California had about 200,000 less votes for Trump than Texas. To speak that another way, California has nearly as may Trump voters as the entire state of Texas.

The most relevant attack you can use against her is lack of _breadth_ of experience, rather than depth, because until her candidacy she's been mostly laser focused on education policy.

As is outlined in those studies I linked, her campaign used a novel and never before seen advertising strategy in the general that virtually ignored policy based ads and instead focused almost entirely on ad hominem attacks on Trump and his fitness for office.

It's true that Trump isn't fit for office for a lot of reasons, but you should probably also run policy based ads too so people know what you're gonna do as president.

All the more so when the media is ignoring the speeches you're giving about policy, and not many people watch the news to begin with.

1638,"> (Even Clinton, had she edged this monster Trump only with a slightly different distribution of voters / better roll of the dice, would still be obstructed by this same GOP congress and GOP state houses, only possibly facing a Red Wave during midterms right now.) 

I'll actually disagree here especially in terms of the red wave - yes she might have had the GOP congress and senate but we all know she would have veto'd those tax cuts and not even allowed Obamacare to be changed. And as for the red wave - I don't think that would have happened because this is where her experience would have come in to play. I love Obama but his inexperience resulted in the dems losing the house but Clinton as president would have been far more experienced and politically shrewd. She was already anticipating 2018 even during the campaign. She was already advocating for a lot of the candidates who are winning now.

>One reason for that is a lot of people have grown disgusted with the limits of the status quo. One party found a way to validate that, the other wasn't in that position.

We're not in power because of people being disgusted with status quo. If that was the case the GOP wouldn't have won congress and senate in 2016. They kept power on the back of populist rhetoric. There was no validation here.

No one stuck their heads in the sand. That's kind of false. Democrats didn't pretend that everything was fine. They just engage that narrative on extreme rhetorics with false promises.

The only ""Elite out-out-touch complacency"" came from Trump. I feel like this a huge misrepresentation of what happened and is a result of the dangerous populist politics at play.

Your message about moderation I agree with completely. But there's no moderate populism. We just have to hope the right kind of candidate replies to it - one who has tangible plans and policies to address populist concerns beyond grandstanding and rhetoric. 

There's no point in being in power if you can't do anything with that power. If AOC and other populist candidates get elected under Trump and a GOP government then what's the point of their ideology and rhetoric if they can't make anything happen? ",FrankieGH,e5h0rd5,hillaryclinton

And to top it all, when he puts economic issues above social and civil rights issues, it's even more alienating to non-white voters. 

Living wage is definitely important but if you're a minority, you're more concerned about getting the job or having the same opportunity for the job as everyone else. Bernie's economics don't factor those issues. 

And if he cared so much about economic equality, then why hasn't he advocated more against voter suppression?

He refuses to discuss race and gender in terms of economics when it obviously plays a huge part. That's why his agenda is narrow and WWC specific.",FrankieGH,e2cqw33,hillaryclinton
3077,"I would never argue she made no mistakes.

In fact, I can list a few more.:P

Now the question is: can you admit Bernie made a huge mistake too?

The key moment in 2016 was imo the morning after Bernie lost the CA primary.

You may remember that rather dramatic moment. The whole press and every politically interested man/ woman was waiting for him to admit defeat, endorse Hillary and go to work.
Not with a huge chip on his shoulder but enthusiastically.

He didnt.
Instead he spoke about how he'd still win, and launched a huge attack on both Hillary and the DNC.

He continued that for 5 full weeks afterwards.
Those 5 weeks are key. They gave us a time period in which Bernie and trump double teamed in their attacks on Hillary.

He created an illusion among his followers he could still win the primaries (which he couldn’t) making their disappointment bigger and bigger.

And then we saw the melodrama at the convention where Bernie’s supporters (not all but a lot) behaved like complete and total scum.
Booing John Lewis? Booing the mothers of the movement?
Booing any POC they could?

Sitting there with their mouths taped and playing the spoiled disgusting drama queens they were?

The months afterwards, I made the silly decision to start working for Our Revolution as a kind of peace offering. I worked on the campaigns of Jayapal and Teachout.
Not a single fucking Berner wanted to work on those campaigns, instead they obsessed over wikileaks and their immature hatred of the woman that won and the dem party.

On the day before the election I wrote a deeply felt passionate plea to the Bernie subs here on reddit begging them to vote for Hillary.
If not for themselves, for minorities, for women, children, Muslims, poc, lgtb.
I warned them how much trump would hurt us.

I was laughed at, yelled at, scorned and ridiculed by the entitled, privileged scumbags who call themselves Bernieorbusters.

And now, we see everything happen that Hillary and we warned for.
Women, poc, lgtb, children are hurting. 
And you or any other Bernie supporter who voted for Hillary are ok, but do not question that :yes Bernie did enormous damage to Hillary's campaign.

He should have campaigned for her from the CA primary on. Should not have taken a leave to write his damn book and most of all: he should have addressed his spoiled privileged supporters not once but over and over again to talk some sense into them about wikileaks, Russian meddling (bots promoting Bernie) and so on and on.

And Jane Sanders should go to hell for her tweet when Bernie endorsed Hillary and told his supporters to vote for her, they shouldn’t always follow/ do what Bernie told them to….

 > Again, the party has lost it's way. And equal rights alone doesn't absolve a parties overwhelming transgressions... 

And here is the twisting of the narrative where y'all imply it's ""only"" about equal rights and use identity politics as a negative. And what are these transgressions? That's a pretty vague statement especially when you're saying that civil rights are secondary to the functionality of a political party. That's something.

> And that's not just my opinion, but it's the opinion of many many many voters. 

No one is disputing that's your opinion. But it's not the opinion of the majority of democrats. If that was the case and the majority of dems felt  the party had lost its way then Bernie would have won the primaries or at the least it would have been a close race but neither happened.

>A lot of long time Democratic voters switched and either voted for trump or a third party candidate and that should speak volumes to you.

Well this is yet another misrepresentation from you. Come on, if you're trying to make a point, be honest instead of making up things and trying to pass them off as facts just because you want to believe it.

>You have to learn to stop taking democratic criticisms against the party as personal attacks and look towards how you can make the party better and inclusive to everyone..

 Where exactly did I take anything as a ""personal attack""? This is exactly why Bernie Bros are so hated - as soon as someone calls out all the lies and misrepresentations y'all throw out, you hit back with condescension like this. It's a pretty low form of discourse.

It's pretty rich to lecture me and other democrats about making the party more inclusive when people like you are actively dismissing equal rights as a secondary issue. Yeah, let's be ""inclusive"" by focusing on one demographic. Tell me how you're being ""inclusive"" by dismissing equal rights and all the economic and humanitarian repercussions?

of course I'm going to post another rant. Do you really expect to lie and misrepresent and get away with it?

The small states wouldn't have joined without assurances that they would continue to have a say in how the nation is run. For example, the New Jersey delegation's proposal had the President elected by a Congress where each state received one equal vote. The drafters of the Connecticut compromise (basically the system we have today) was very well aware that the electoral college it created would serve to ensure a geographically diverse national support for a presidential candidate. 

It serves that purpose quite well. If you imagine an election with two presidential candidates, where each gets 50% +1 votes in each state they win, the most lopsided scenario possible where one candidate wins the electoral vote without the popular vote still has the winner earning 49.6% of the vote.

4459,">If you didn’t know Nixon had been a Hillary supporter in the primaries, you sure couldn’t tell from her newly minted identity as a “bold progressive” who accused her opponent Andrew Cuomo of not being a “Real Democrat.” She described how “like so many others” she had been “inspired” by Bernie Sanders’ “revolutionary, people-powered” campaign. Her criticisms of Cuomo are stuffed with triggers like “ultra rich donors,” her platform reads like a Xerox of Sanders’ 2016 positions, and just in case you still were wondering about her revolutionary creds, she has sprinkled the p-word generously throughout her tweets, making sure that despite her earlier support of Hillary and her own wealth and fame, she doesn’t give off the deadly whiff of **“establishment”** BO.

>With such aggressive self-branding, it’s no surprise that Bernie Bros adore Nixon (one describes having a “similar feeling” watching her speak as he had watching Bernie) and many Hillary-supporters felt betrayed (“I was going to vote for you, but not now! Never!”) The twitter-storm that followed the “Our Revolution” announcement was fiercely divisive, and for me, brought on a case of political PTSD. Again? **Have the Democrats learned nothing?**

>Nixon’s tarring of Cuomo as “not a Real Democrat” was particularly chilling for me, as I got to thinking about that January day before the New Hampshire primary, and the speech in which Bernie Sanders charged Hillary Clinton, for the first (but hardly the last) time, of not being **“a real progressive”**, while hundreds of young people booed her and cheered him.

...

>Since then, despite all the talk of needing to “unify” and “heal divisions,” **the branding of Democrats into “progressive” and “establishment”** (or sometimes, “centrist”) **has come to dominate how candidates are identified** — and often self-identify — as with Cynthia Nixon.

2452,"My career's in tech infrastructure and security (more infra than security, but I'm not ignorant), so that's where my perspective is focused here.

Would there be direct evidence?  In a well-run setup, possibly. Depends on how good the hackers were.

In almost any of these setups?  Fuck no.  

All the circumstantial evidence others are complaining about is *probably* the best the public's gonna get.  I can't speak to legal status, but in the tech world, the evidence Michael Harriot laid out in this piece is more than enough to answer the kinds of questions we tend to have.  Those questions boil down to essentially one:

Given the available metadata (logs, audit trails, system monitoring histograms, diffs between backups and live data, etc), *can we trust that this system wasn't tampered with*?

That question itself is generally made up of two smaller ones:  What *do* we know? and What *can* we know?  I almost started basically typing out the article in my own words, but I'll skip that part.  Between how badly-secured these systems were (both design and implementation, and all the way from end-user to database backends), how badly audited and logged they were, and how badly backups were kept (if any), I think most competent professionals would generally agree on these points:

* We know attackers gained access to live voting systems/databases

* We know end-user voting machines are embarrassingly easy to gain access to.

* Due to bad security practices of many kinds, and in at least one case deliberate deletion of backups, *it is not possible* to verify whether or not data was changed in many of these cases.

In the computer security world, if you can't verify something, being thorough means you must assume the worst-case scenario.  How you deal with it depends a lot on context but to stay focused: This means that we as technical professionals *must* assume rolls and votes were tampered with.

The malfeasance and incompetence continually demonstrated over the course of the last two decades or so of modern electronic voting in the US has the general public in a position where anyone with a strong enough political lean can accept or dismiss the available data as they wish.  The pattern-matcher in me wants to think that's on purpose but that's neither here nor there.

As an industry expert, the 'case' presented in this article is highly convincing.  ""Can we trust that these systems were not tampered with?""  No, full stop.  Will we ever have *direct* evidence that votes were changed? Given the mismanagement involved, I very strongly doubt that.  Is that enough for a legal case? I have no idea. If I were brought in to fix the situation? This is more than enough.",tuba_man,e3537y7,hillaryclinton

999,">Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh decided that to have any chance to reach the court, he would have to shed the pretense he was a fair-minded, calm, judicious thinker. **He came out in the afternoon filled with venom, screaming at the committee. His life was being ruined, he claimed. This was a Clinton-like smear.** His anger was both **frightening and unexpected** — if you thought he was that intellectual whom conservatives have swooned over. He yelled, and he cried. If you thought he was sincere, one could also appreciate how **partisan and emotional** he had become.

~

>If President Trump loved the nasty, male grievance game, the rest of us had reason to wonder if anyone of this temperament — Cornyn, Graham or Kavanaugh — should be in a position of power. **If they were women, they would be called “hysterical.”**

~

>The refusal to get the facts is both a telling admission of concern about what they would find and a violation the judicial goal of truth-seeking. It’s **a political calculation, exactly what you don’t want to see from a judge**.

~

>The worst moment was his confrontation with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) who questioned him about blackout drinking. She explained that she understood alcohol abuse because her father was an alcoholic. Have you ever blacked out? she asked. He sneered in response, “Have you?” It was **a moment of singular cruelty and disrespect**. One saw a flash in the exchange with Klobuchar the same **sense of entitlement, cruelty and lack of simple decency** that Christine Blasey Ford allegedly experienced way back when, the memory seared in her brain of two obnoxious teens laughing at her ordeal.

~

>Kavanaugh says he was not the attacker. But even if you believe that — despite Ford’s riveting testimony — one can reasonably conclude he is not the right person to sit on the court. **His anger toward liberals is palpable, his lack of humility bracing. He has the partisan mindset that opponents are unworthy of respect and kindness.**

~

>... his heart is that of a **conservative partisan**, one who tried so very hard to make himself into Supreme Court material. The **mentality of a political operative** — willing to go on Fox News, **ready to inflame passions, disrespectful toward opponents** — is still there. A nonpartisan would ask for, if not demand, an FBI investigation and Judge’s appearance. Kavanaugh wants to avoid both at all costs.

Oh and seriously? You think Underwood, Lucy McBath, Sharice Davids, Gina Ortez to just name a few, ran on Sanders-esque platforms?
How can you not see how you A: belittle what they accomplished by attributing what they did to Sanders, B: completely misrepresent their positions. 
Sanders actively ran against Davids, to name just one example. Wanted to push the white out of state guy instead of her, so lets not pretend theyre connected to Sanders, shall we?

No, they had nothing to do with Sanders or his platform. Lucy McBath ran because of her son being murdered and because she wants to fight for gun control (against which bernie voted repeatedly).

Policies matters, sure, but so does skin color. Representation matters.
This isnt the moment to run a 80 year old white guy. That applies to Sanders but also to Biden.
You may see that as bias, but there is no way inm hell I'm gonna end up voting for a 80 year old white guy in the coming primaries, in the time of 'me too' and raging white nationalism.

>So by your logic we should accept keep operating on the Founding Fathers' logic whereby certain states got more power over others?

That isn't the case and isn't how the electoral college works. Again, you don't understand it.

>How do you justify that when these certain states contribute less to the country than others?

Because this is a huge, diverse country and letting a handful of liberal urban centers control literally every single presidential election is stupid. We're a union of 50 states. It's in the fucking name of the country. Believe it or not, even those flyover states you hate so much deserve a say. And that's what this system does, it gives them more of a say so you're punished for only catering to latte liberals. She didn't campaign, she was a bad candidate, she lost. All while knowing how the electoral college worked beforehand.

>How exactly does direct democracy suck?

Because people are fucking idiots. Some of them can't even understand the basic point of the electoral college! There is not a single surviving direct democracy in the world today for a good reason.

Hillary Clinton

I found this also very curious. Because to the best of my memory, no man who ever lost a presidential election was ever told to shut up and go away. And I’m glad they weren’t, because each had points of view and experiences that were worth hearing about.

I’ve given a lot of thought to this, and I do conclude — and I write about it in my book — that there is this long, long history of trying to silence women. Literally in literature, in the western canon, it goes back to The Odyssey.

Penelope is holding the whole country together while Odysseus is taking his time getting back. She’s raising their son, Telemachus.

There’s a very telling scene where all the usual partiers and others are hanging around, hoping that she’ll finally decide that her husband’s dead and marry one of them so that they can take over. Telemachus is now about 17, so he’s a young man.

His mother comes down, as she always did, to greet people and listen to their complaints and to continue being the glue that held the country together. And her son greets her by saying, “Mother, go back upstairs. Speech is not for women.”

The really terrific classics professor Mary Beard — who some of you know, and if you don’t, look her up — has just written a book about women and power, in which she traces this whole line of being quiet: “Don’t speak. Don’t speak up.”

Now, for everyone saying, “Well, that’s a Hillary Clinton problem.” The people who they’d interview, saying, “Well, of course I would vote for a woman! Just not that woman.” In the last year and a half, what have we seen?""",Danie2009,dy04ex2,hillaryclinton

>Now we must do all we can to save our democracy and heal our body politic.

>First, **we’ve got to mobilize massive turnout in the 2018 midterms.** There are fantastic candidates running all over the country, making their compelling cases every day about how they’ll raise wages, bring down health-care costs, and fight for justice. If they win, they’ll do great things for America. And we could finally see some congressional oversight of the White House.

>When the dust settles, we have to do some serious housecleaning. After Watergate, Congress passed a whole slew of reforms in response to Richard Nixon’s abuses of power. After Trump, we’re going to need a similar process. For example, Trump’s corruption should teach us that all **future candidates for president and presidents themselves should be required by law to release their tax returns. They also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules.**

>**A main area of reform should be improving and protecting our elections**. The Senate Intelligence Committee has made a series of bipartisan recommendations for how to better secure America’s voting systems, including **paper ballot backups, vote audits, and better coordination among federal, state, and local authorities on cybersecurity.** That’s a good start. Congress should also repair the damage the Supreme Court did to the **Voting Rights Act by restoring the full protections that voters need and deserve**, as well as the voting rights of Americans who have served time in prison and paid their debt to society. We need **early voting and voting by mail in every state** in America, and automatic, **universal voter registration** so every citizen who is eligible to vote is able to vote. We need to **overturn Citizens United and get secret money out of our politics**. And you won’t be surprised to hear that I passionately believe it’s time to **abolish the Electoral College**.

>But even the best rules and regulations won’t protect us if we don’t find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and **rekindle our civic spirit**. There are concrete steps that would help, like greatly expanding national-service programs and bringing back civics education in our schools. We also need **systemic economic reforms** that reduce inequality and the unchecked power of corporations and give a strong voice to working families. And ultimately, healing our country will come down to each of us, as citizens and individuals, doing the work—trying to reach across divides of race, class, and politics and see through the eyes of people very different from ourselves. When we think about politics and judge our leaders, we can’t just ask, “Am I better off than I was four years ago?” We have to ask, “Are we better off? Are we as a country better, stronger, and fairer?” **Democracy works only when we accept that we’re all in this together.**

I've lived in Europe for a long time and I prefer what every western european country has: a hybrid system.

Basically, the government should provide for lower income people + the basic healthcare needed and people can buy additional insurance through a private insurance company.

I've yet to see a country with single payer or with what comes close to single payer (dont forget pure single payer is extremely rare) which didnt have huge waitinglists, or a completely clogged up healthcare system.

Try needing a doctor in england or Italy (two countries which come close to single payer in western europe)...
Christ, I had a simple ear infection this summer and I sat in an emergency room (for an ear infection...) for 5 freaking hours.

I prefer the system in germany, the netherlands, belgium and the scandinavian countries.

You had Russian hackers and Russian  bots doing everything they could to spread misinformation and stoke the fire about Clinton.

You had James Comey releasing a letter 10 days before the election because he was so sure Clinton would win that the letter would be irrelevant.  You had pollsters basically saying it would take a miracle for Clinton would lose and giving up on polling key states the last 2-4 weeks of the campaigns.

5622,"The anti-abortion crowd really bothers me, especially since I've had abortions.  They talk about being pro-life, but they completely disregard existing life.  If a woman doesn't want to go through a pregnancy and have something in her body that she doesn't want there, she shouldn't have to.  And if a woman doesn't want to parent, then that would be unfair to everyone involved.  If I got pregnant again, an abortion would be the only option. I'm in my 20s, in school full time, working 30 hours a week, making less than 20K a year and unmarried. Additionally, I know that I'm not prepared emotionally to raise a child. I know some people talk about adoption, but it would absolutely kill me for the baby that I carried to be considering another woman his or her mother. Some young women talk about how they keep their babies because they love them too much to give them up, but the fact is, loving the baby isn't enough. Love isn't going to provide food or shelter or insurance, money will do that, and I barely have enough to support myself, let alone a child. Even birth control isn't 100% effective.

""The point being, I’m so happy you’re not being silent. But I want you to talk, if you could, about that decision not to be silent. And also, how are you dealing with the constant barrage of attempts to silence you?
Hillary Clinton

I found this also very curious. Because to the best of my memory, no man who ever lost a presidential election was ever told to shut up and go away. And I’m glad they weren’t, because each had points of view and experiences that were worth hearing about.

I’ve given a lot of thought to this, and I do conclude — and I write about it in my book — that there is this long, long history of trying to silence women. Literally in literature, in the western canon, it goes back to The Odyssey.

Penelope is holding the whole country together while Odysseus is taking his time getting back. She’s raising their son, Telemachus.

There’s a very telling scene where all the usual partiers and others are hanging around, hoping that she’ll finally decide that her husband’s dead and marry one of them so that they can take over. Telemachus is now about 17, so he’s a young man.

His mother comes down, as she always did, to greet people and listen to their complaints and to continue being the glue that held the country together. And her son greets her by saying, “Mother, go back upstairs. Speech is not for women.”

The really terrific classics professor Mary Beard — who some of you know, and if you don’t, look her up — has just written a book about women and power, in which she traces this whole line of being quiet: “Don’t speak. Don’t speak up.”

Now, for everyone saying, “Well, that’s a Hillary Clinton problem.” The people who they’d interview, saying, “Well, of course I would vote for a woman! Just not that woman.” In the last year and a half, what have we seen?""",Danie2009,dy04ex2,hillaryclinton

I did. How did I manage that? 

> And what does her husband's strategy have to do with her? 

Her campaign included good things she did as First Lady. If you read articles from the 1990s, they all call her the most politically-involved First Lady ever. Many articles are mad about this, saying that it’s an unconstitutional expansion of the executive branch. She could show up at an event and it was like the President had shown up - like there were two Presidents. Her time as First Lady then launched the rest of her political career. Her husband campaigned for her, and her campaigns followed the Clintonism script quite exactly. 

If the accomplishments of the White House when she was First Lady count, so do the failings.

1814,"> Worrying overmuch about policy detail is actually sort of useless until that situation is on the horizon.

Actually worrying about policy detail is anything but useless and this where the problem lies at the moment.

Populist politics is extremely dangerous - we're seeing it with Trump right now. We've seen it with the Germans pre-WWII when their brand of populism failed and allowed extremists to take over. That's what is happening now.

Populism is dangerous whether its from the left or the right. There's no point in electing candidates on the basis of their rhetoric if they can't deliver once in office. Populism feeds the masses without actually providing actual solutions. It's a power play tactic. 

If the voting public actually care about how laws are changed then they should care enough not to vote on rhetoric alone because we all know that fizzles out eventually. 

Policy detail is exactly the thing we need to be thinking about in progressive candidates. For far too long we've had so called progressive candidates who have been elected on their rhetoric and then have failed to deliver once in office. You call it the establishment but they did exactly what people like ACO are doing now to get elected.

They use populist rhetoric to get elected and then stay in office for years without doing anything. This is exactly the thing we should be fighting against.

My interpretation of this is that Hillary would rather voluntarily give up her security clearance rather than having it *revoked* because 1) revocation would create a bigger news story, the press would rehash 2016, and more important issues would be ignored and 2) she doesn't want to take part in establishing this new precedent of the President revoking security clearances for people he doesn't like.

I'm a PoC myself, and I'd rather have talks that discuss that strengths and weaknesses of all candidates, both past and current, than shy away from it. Pointing out their faults does not detract from their accomplishments, Obama obviously will go down in history, as will Clinton for their strides in their fields, given that they do not match the traditional layout of a male, White politician. They're both accomplished individuals, but that does not make them perfect. Those who don't observe history, are doomed to repeat it.
