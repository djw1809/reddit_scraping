You support Bernie? Yet you don't know what he stands for or what he's been preaching? How is this possible?

He literally came out and dismissed identity politics:

And in fact, *every* person who won the popular vote for president and lost the election who then ran again *all* won the next time.

I randomly checked in here, don't think I've been here since 2016, and I was surprised by the tweet. I didn't think Hillary was still active politically and I didn't know this sub was active either. 



This post reached r/all, and I saw a comment that was basically the same reaction I had to seeing it. Then I saw it was getting downvoted, and the user I've been going back and forth with was being very personal and hostile toward that person. It reminded me of the general feeling I've always had when I come here. I unsubbed a long time ago because the culture here is actually kind of toxic. So I said something along those lines. 


I notice the same things in r/politics. So many conservatives have liberal stances when you question them in a way that doesn't trigger them. So many of them are looking for the door. But they feel unwelcome by liberals, because there is an endless stream of shaming and ridicule toward them. This approach will never persuade anyone. It drives people to entrench themselves. If you want people to join you, you have to respect where they currently are and seek common ground and common goals, then maybe if you're lucky the differences will become common ground too. For such a prominent political figure it's always struck me as bizarre how exclusive and hostile her subreddit is. 


Liberals seem so convinced that they have the moral and intellectual high ground that they're oblivious to how they are perceived and how much they alienate potential allies. I don't care about mean comments from internet strangers. It was annoying for maybe a few minutes. I care about unifying the lower and middle classes. Projection and lack of mutual respect is a pervasive issue and a major obstacle to that. I commented because of the condescending hostility I saw toward another user for having the wrong reaction to the post. This sub and this public figure got some rare visibility on this site and screwed it up. It makes Hillary and liberals look bad. I think a lot of people have checked in here and decided not to stick around. There's no reason why Hillary couldn't have a  comparable presence to Bernie on this site. I think this sub, and liberals in general, shoot themselves in the foot. ",scrumtrellescent,dy4w2lo,hillaryclinton

If we're not willing to let primarying be a credible threat, we'll end up with a bunch of Democrats in office who only pass compromise policies.

(People on this thread talking about Obamacare: remember that Obamacare _is_ a compromise policy. It's simply Romneycare at a national level. It's mandatory participation in capitalism. The progressive option is single-payer. The individual mandate was originally proposed by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation in 1989. It first got to Congress as a bill sponsored by 19 Republican senators in 1993, aimed at preventing Hillary Clinton's _employer_ mandate from passing. Obama proposed PPACA after getting a bipartisan group of senators together to figure out something with a chance of bipartisan support, and they suggested the individual mandate. The idea that Obamacare is a left-wing proposal has its roots in right-wing obstructionism instead of facts, because the Republicans don't want health care at all. Us going ""but she supports Obamacare!"" as evidence of someone's left-wing _bona fides_ is just buying into right-wing alternative facts.)",ldpreload,dyi5jg3,hillaryclinton

That's why they demonized Obama for 8 years. They demonized Al Gore. Hillary is the only one who persisted against them. They'll do the same to Bernie and anyone else who ends up leading the Democrats. It's naive to think otherwise and make this just about Hillary.

The only reason Fox news is still obsessed about Hillary is simply because despite her loss she is still the most powerful voice on the Democrats' side. 

You want her to get out of the public eye? Heck, even when she was out of it, they were obsessed about her. 

Donald Trump wouldn't have beaten any other candidate? You know that for a fact right? You know that cause Bernie was scrutinized by the right and Fox News? 

The truth, which is difficult for Fox News, GOP and Bernie Bros to accept, is that Hillary's loss didn't reflect the will of the majority of the country. Her loss was because of a flawed system. And at the end of the day, she stepped away, and took her time and no one has stepped up to take charge in an adequate way. So she's still the most powerful voice.",FrankieGH,e2ctnjg,hillaryclinton

The small states wouldn't have joined without assurances that they would continue to have a say in how the nation is run. For example, the New Jersey delegation's proposal had the President elected by a Congress where each state received one equal vote. The drafters of the Connecticut compromise (basically the system we have today) was very well aware that the electoral college it created would serve to ensure a geographically diverse national support for a presidential candidate. 

It serves that purpose quite well. If you imagine an election with two presidential candidates, where each gets 50% +1 votes in each state they win, the most lopsided scenario possible where one candidate wins the electoral vote without the popular vote still has the winner earning 49.6% of the vote.

I wish this were set up like the [population dot map](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/) so that all those huge areas in the midwest and west where no one lives would LOOK like no one lives there.

https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/11/21/1602489/-Sanders-calls-on-Democrats-to-ditch-identity-politics

There are more examples where he favors candidates who are anti-abortion just because they were for WWC issues.

Maybe you don't haven't been paying attention but don't assume others haven't either. We've been listening to Bernie. 

If you want rational debate then maybe you should educate yourself first.

Finally we have the evidence of states that have legalized it as well as entire countries where there has been no societal break down, and no notable negative affects.

Just look at all the benefit of the doubt Ivanka Trump gets. She's apparently against separating children from parents if you listen to the press. Yet she hasn't said one word publicly. They are going off a so-called conservation she had in private with Trump. Same with Melania. 

We should fight this perception of liberal bias and counter these narratives with questions. Instead we try to get rid of strong voices.

Hillary helped raise 500,000 recently. She can do more in her capacity and so can the Obama's. Just because they are perceived as toxic doesn't mean we bow down to the Republicans.

Men today did not invent the expectation that men should make the first move in dating, or male ""toughness"" & ""boys don't cry"", or the idea that a rejection is somehow an insult.

It’s incredibly unfortunate that it’s this way. If West Virginia has some staying power it would grow and prosper. 

I might also add that I’m proud of my home state for not developing like the rest of the country. Economically it’s a disaster and don’t think because I’m going to an expensive college that I grew up in the minority in West Virginia. My family was lucky to be considered upper lower class, my education is payed for with loans and scholarships. The reason I’m proud is because this state is so wild! It’s full of forests and wildlife. No matter where you go you are best weld in between large trees and mountains full of beauty.

4333,"Maybe this is a weird thing to focus on, but this article was so oddly framed.  It feels like the writer was talking to an American for the first time and noting all the differences in language, rather than interviewing someone with a lot of wonderful things to say.

Of course Chelsea wouldn't say, for example, ""Well done,"" because that's a British colloquialism, and Chelsea is American.  I'm trying to think of an American equivalent, but we don't really have one, and I feel like that's because, ironically enough, that turn of phrase sounds incredibly condescending to my American ears. 

From what I gathered, the writer has a problem with Chelsea's American syntax, word choice, and construction, and uses that to chastise her for being too aloof.  I think the point the writer was trying to make, if I'm being generous, was that Chelsea is polished (and of course she is, as the writer pointed out, she's always been in the political spotlight), but then she (the writer) called her language clunky, which negates that point.  

I think Chelsea's extremely well-spoken, yes, just like her mother.  But, I'm sick of that being termed as cold, especially from foreign press who, in this case, doesn't seem to understand our speech patterns.  

I loved what Chelsea said, but hated the framing of it.  Maybe the writer could have focused on her meaning, rather than the words used to convey it.  But I guess I should take my own advice and focus on Chelsea instead, too. :)",Thankful_Lez,dzpt6m2,hillaryclinton

>She supports single-payer health care, tuition-free college, ending private prisons, and clean campaign financing. These are some of her main policy positions, none of which Hillary Clinton supported and all of which Bernie supported.

Hillary wasn't against single payer healthcare. She was just against Bernie's plan. Her plan built towards it.

She supported tuition-free college, ending private prisons and definitely for campaign finance reform.  

And by the way, one of Cortez's big issues is criminal justice reform which was also Hillary's. Not Bernie's. And also paid family leave. Again, another main issue on Hillary's platform. Not Bernie's.

It's really amazing that you have no clue about someone you're attacking in this way. Doesn't matter if you're a Marxist or whatever... at least you should know what you're talking about instead of outright lying. Unless you yourself don't know these facts and if that's  the case then please educate yourself.

>Do you remember the Bankruptcy Bill? Hillary flipped on that hardcore. There's her record on banks in a nutshell.

Again, I'm going to ask about how much you know about this apart from the surface level knowledge you're exhibiting.  If you wanna talk about the bankruptcy bill as an example of her track record then why don't you discuss the intricacies of her vote:

https://medium.com/@zacharyleven/the-case-for-hillary-3564233d524f

Have a read. It might be informative especially if you think that's her record on banks in a nutshell. You clearly have a lot of information gaps.

So again, it doesn't matter whether Cortez is DSC or you're a marxist... it matters about the issues and about being honest about issues which you are not. At the end of the day, you're hurting yourself with this kind of dishonesty.

3661,">  Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 

No, where do you read that out? It says, that not everyone who is from a minority is automatically progressive. Thats why I gave you some examples, almost no left-leaning liberal would prefer a female/latina/black republican over a male/white/heterosexual (progressive) democrat. 

>  Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 

It might be that he thinks a lot more in terms of class than other politicians do (if they do it at all) because he says he is a socialist. But still he made clear quite a lot that racial and gender justice is really important (to him).

> Bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative.

Come on.. I am pretty sure Bernie knew Hillary Clinton from their time in Senate together.. 

> Maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a Latina woman.

He could have done that. But I don't know the centext.. I have searched for quite a bit but didn't found an article with the full question but I found one with the full (long) answer. Yes, he could simply have asked what she wants to change or whats to do and when she replied he could than have said ""okay, thats great"" or ""yeah, thats not enough"". But what he could also have done is say that it is really important go get enough minoritiy candidates into politics but they also have to be progressives. I don't see a problem there. (Even tough his statement beginns with ""Let me respond to the question in a way you may not be happy with"", so its probably more than ""I want to be the first latina.."" but a real question)

> You're the one, like Bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing.

Where am I beeing very arrogant? And where am I reducing identity politics as a negative thing?

> I mean Bernie called her unqualified and his campaign manager branded her ""ambitious"" because she wanted to run for president.

Bernie replied to her, when she said that Bernie didnt do his homework and that doesnt understand how to break up big banks and voters should ask themselves if he can deliver what he promises. Then Bernie just replied ""Theyre going to question my qualifications, so I am questioning theirs."" And he repeated the same in a debate (""you might wonder about your qaulifications Madame Secretary"". And then he said why he is questioning them: Iraq war, trade agreements, super PACs, Wall Street. Yes, this might be a bit childish (Bernie said that ""we"" shouldnt get into that tit-for-tat) but I dont think its sexist. 

It is basically ""being a women is not enough"" because you have to stand up against big banks and not take their money. And the ""ambitious"" thing is actually another context.. but okay, I am not here to say that every member of the campaign is perfect. But its a bit far-fetched to say that Bernie reduced Clinton to her identity because his campaign manager says, that she has ambitions to be president... thats basically a fact for (nearly) every candidate.

> He dismissed Trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction.

No he said that this is shameful and its probably not against Clinton but this would be against all women. A quote of the interview: ""Maybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing America. Donald Trump will not look quite so interesting in that context."" He is not saying, that abortion rights are not important (which is insane to say if you know his voting record and his engagement for women rights.

> And then there's his hardcore supporters coming after Hillary supporters as vagina voters.

And then there is the hardcore supporters of Hillary coming after Bernie supporters (but again Bernie supporters /=/ Bernie) who say that there is a special place in hell for women who dont support Clinton. Or that young women support Bernie because they want to meet boys. Or all the ""Bernie Bros"" that just support Bernie because he is a man. 

> when he ran against a female governor of Vermont he made it about her gender and how it would be sexist to vote for her because she was a woman

I dont know about the time, that was before I was born. What he said though is that many people are excited because she is a women but there is nothing more (because) he is the bigger feminist. I just dont know if that is true. But yeah, it would be sexist to vote for Bernie if they just do it because he is a men.

Hillary Clinton

I found this also very curious. Because to the best of my memory, no man who ever lost a presidential election was ever told to shut up and go away. And I’m glad they weren’t, because each had points of view and experiences that were worth hearing about.

I’ve given a lot of thought to this, and I do conclude — and I write about it in my book — that there is this long, long history of trying to silence women. Literally in literature, in the western canon, it goes back to The Odyssey.

Penelope is holding the whole country together while Odysseus is taking his time getting back. She’s raising their son, Telemachus.

There’s a very telling scene where all the usual partiers and others are hanging around, hoping that she’ll finally decide that her husband’s dead and marry one of them so that they can take over. Telemachus is now about 17, so he’s a young man.

His mother comes down, as she always did, to greet people and listen to their complaints and to continue being the glue that held the country together. And her son greets her by saying, “Mother, go back upstairs. Speech is not for women.”

The really terrific classics professor Mary Beard — who some of you know, and if you don’t, look her up — has just written a book about women and power, in which she traces this whole line of being quiet: “Don’t speak. Don’t speak up.”

Now, for everyone saying, “Well, that’s a Hillary Clinton problem.” The people who they’d interview, saying, “Well, of course I would vote for a woman! Just not that woman.” In the last year and a half, what have we seen?""",Danie2009,dy04ex2,hillaryclinton

CTR was a small operation with pretty tame goals.

So many political debates were casually dismissed with a ""well, you're obviously a CTR shill""  amidst a sea of approving upvotes.

2701,"While I think she'd be really great for the country, I want to see a sample size of women candidates that is more than 1. If another woman runs, we can then see if the nation treats that woman exactly the same as they treated Clinton or if they treat her differently (more rationally). I sadly think the nation will treat her just as insanely as they did Clinton, but that will mean we as a society can no longer use Clinton as a scapegoat for our collective misogyny and we'd have to admit that we treat female candidates differently. Right now people say ""it's not that she's a woman; it's that she's Hillary Clinton."" ",BumBiddlyBiddlyBum,e2obbne,hillaryclinton
591,"So I find it funny that the media have resurrected the old ""Democrats don't have a message"" while willfully ignoring the actual messaging from Democrats except when it's Trump or Bernie using the Democrats as a punching bag.

There's plenty of Democrat messaging going on yet you have publications like the Daily Beast publishing Hillary bashing articles by GOP strategists, passing them off as ""journalists"". 

I read this ""article"" from Liz Mair... a whole lot of garbage. She basically admits that bashing Hillary is a public service to Republicans like her.

So how can the media legitimately criticize the democrats when they themselves publish partisan bullshit like this.

1831,"Hey, you keep editing and deleting your comments - it's kind of hard to have a genuine conversation with someone who does that.

Where have I made assumptions about you? Politics is always personal... I don't think I've insulted you - I'm going by the comments you have made - if you take that personally then maybe you shouldn't be engaging in these discussions and then feel offended.

And yes Bernie has everything to do with this - you talk about AOC and populism and dismiss Hillary's primary win - it's not really hard to see what you're implying here. This has everything to do with Bernie.

>(such as Joe Biden, who tried to jump in in October '15 after his grieving process concluded, until party leaders up to and including Obama warned him they'd rake him over the coals. Again, not the typical experience of a candidate. Which brings us to Nita Lowey's experience in 2000, another case of red carpet treatment).

And again, all of this is false. Party leaders and Obama didn't tell him not to run because they'd rake him over the coals... that's completely false. Firstly that was not the reason and secondly neither obama or any party leader was part of his decision and he's spoken about this. So it's curious where you're getting these ""facts"" from? And if you read his book, you'll see that he and Hillary had discussed running against each other and were okay with it as long as they didn't run negative campaigns against each other. Again, these are facts not ""establishment/party"" conspiracies which you keep trying to imply.

And also about Lowey's experience - she dropped out and was even supporting Hillary for the seat before she dropped out.  It's not red carpet treatment at all. This is what people who support their party do. Also by this logic, the party would have probably not Bernie run since he was an independent but of course that's not true because it's not the party at play here. 

You seem to be insinuating that Hillary was gifted all her elections - can you say that about her re-election to the Senate? And if she had a red carpet treatment how did they let Obama run against her in 2008? And if that was the case then why did they let Bernie and all the rest of the dem nominees run against her in 2016? 

This is nothing personal but if you're engaging in a discussion and make some clearly false claims then be expect to be questioned. You clearly have a fixed perception of Hillary which has emerged through your comments and it has nothing to do with her policies. You're in a Hillary sub... like why are you offended if someone calls you out on it?

And just for the sake of it... you would have preferred Biden to run? According to what you've said, how exactly would he have been different as president with a GOP house and senate?

Again, don't take it personally - I'm simply responding to your words. ",FrankieGH,e5hdouz,hillaryclinton

2095,"> If you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.

I never said this. Nobody actually ever says this. They say (something like) having white skin is a privilege.  That's different than legit thinking that all white men are privileged. I mean, obviously, we people in Los Angeles don't think this.  We see white homeless folks every day.  The right willfully misinterprets this, just like they did with Black Lives Matter (Too)... not (Only) Black Lives Matter.  To be honest, I'd like there to be a better word than 'privilege,' because it gets easily misinterpreted... but, then, when you have a massive machine trying to discredit liberals who want to get rid of the bigoted oppression of individuals based on what 'group' they belong to, any phrase you use will get twisted to be intentionally misunderstood.   

""Sad to say but Democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican.""  This is far from true.  Most Republicans voted for Trump.  He is a fascist bigot who openly stated he wanted to ban all Muslims from entering America.  You are engaging in a false equivalency.  

""It’s not about privilege, race or gender."" For people who are oppressed, daily, based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion?  Yes, it is about that.  A poor black dude faces oppression that a poor white dude does not.  This doesn't mean a poor white dude has an easy life - that's not how existence works.  Like, the fact that my skin color doesn't cause me to be oppressed... that doesn't mean my life is sunshine, roses, gold, and happiness. 

It's just that society does not oppress a poor white dude because of his whiteness. 

The greatest trick ever pulled was to oppress people based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion... And then, when folks try to fight back against identity-based oppression, yell that the folks pushing back against that evil are the ones engaging in divisive 'identity politics.'

New data makes it clear: Nonvoters handed Trump the presidency
https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump
5-7 minutes


Then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shakes hands as he arrives at a campaign rally on Aug. 30, 2016, in Everett, Wash. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)

Most of our assessments of the electorate in 2016 are dependent on estimates. Polling before the election that suggested where people were leaning; exit polling after the fact that gives us some sense of who actually turned out. When more than 137 million people vote, understanding exactly who they were and why they voted the way they did necessarily involves some guesswork.

On Thursday, though, Pew Research Center released an unusually robust survey of the 2016 electorate. In addition to having asked people how they voted, Pew’s team verified that they did, giving us a picture not only of the electorate but also of those who didn’t vote. There are a number of interesting details that emerge from that research, including a breakdown of President Trump’s support that confirms much of his base has backed him enthusiastically since the Republican primaries.

The data also makes another point very clear: Those who didn’t vote are as responsible for the outcome of the election as those who did.

As we noted shortly after the election, about 30 percent of Americans were eligible to vote but decided not to, a higher percentage than the portion of the country who voted for either Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Pew’s data shows that almost half of the nonvoters were nonwhite and two-thirds were under age 50. More than half of those who didn’t vote earned less than $30,000 a year; more than half of those who did vote were over age 50.


Pew’s data allows us to see very specifically how voter turnout and candidate support compare. By looking at the preferred candidate in a demographic group and then comparing the density of that group in the population that voted with the density in the nonvoting population, we get a sense for how nonvoters determined the 2016 results.

We’ll start simply. Women tended to prefer Clinton to Trump and made up a higher percentage of the voting population than the nonvoting population. That split alone helps explain Clinton’s popular-vote victory.


But “women” contains multitudes. Black, working-class Democratic women; white, wealthy Republican women. The split by party shows how that makes a difference: Republicans made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool and, unsurprisingly, broadly supported Trump.


(Remember: We’re not comparing actual turnout to the pool of registered voters — we’re comparing percent of voters to percent of nonvoters. In a world where voting doesn’t vary by demographic, the percent of voters from any group would be the same as that group’s percentage of nonvoters. If a demographic group votes less than another, though, it will be below the centerline while the other group is above it.)

Looking at race and ethnicity, we see how the heavier turnout of white voters affected the contest. Black and Hispanic voters voted much more heavily Democratic than white votes backed Trump, but they turned out less.


While half of nonvoters were white, 74 percent of voters were.

An even more dramatic example of that comes when we look at age groups.


People under 30 preferred Clinton by 30 points but made up much more of the nonvoter population than the population that actually voted. A third of nonvoters were under 30; only 1 in 8 voters was in that age group.

Here’s what the income divide in Pew’s chart looks like.


Each of these demographic groups contains fragments of the others, of course. Some of those earning under $30,000 in income are Republican or black or female. If we overlap race and income, the dots above separate a bit.


Whites making more than $30,000 a year skewed Republican and made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool. Poorer whites and nonwhites generally made up more of the nonvoter pool than the voter pool.

Income and education generally correlate, but the chart looking at education and race is remarkably different from the chart above. College graduates leaned toward Clinton — but whites without college degrees voted heavily for Trump. Nonwhites without a college education were 40 percent of the nonvoter pool and only 1 in 5 actual voters.


Evangelicals were the most strongly pro-Trump of the religious groups of voters, and they represented more of the voting pool than the nonvoting pool. Black Protestants and Hispanic Catholics made up less of the voting population than the nonvoting population — and strongly preferred Clinton.


If we step back and look at the bigger picture — all the demographic data points from Pew’s analysis, including those above — the expected trend emerges.


Demographic groups that preferred Trump were three times as likely to be a bigger part of the voter pool than nonvoters. Among groups that preferred Clinton, they were about 50 percent more likely to be a bigger part of the nonvoting community.

Clinton nonetheless won the popular vote. But an increased turnout of under-30 voters in, say, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan could easily have changed the results of the history.",ostrich_semen,e406ba8,hillaryclinton
1143,"I get so sick of the lazy ""bad candidate"" argument. She got 3 million more votes than Bernie. She got 3 million more votes than Donald. She won every debate. She had a better convention.

Just because we all have the benefit of hindsight doesn't make her a ""bad candidate"" after the fact. She DID have a huge rally in Pennsylvania with Michelle Obama.

She lost because:

- James Comey
- Republicans were allowed to use tax payer dollars to hold bogus investigations and hearings during an election year.
- The media treated her fake 2 scandals (emails/Benghazi) equal to Donald's MANY real scandals (Russia, Access Hollywood, Attack Gold Star parents, Trump University, Trump's taxes, Trump Foundation, etc).

- Complacent voters
- Easily fooled voters (especially anyone who voted for Jill Stein)

2848,"Tack-on 2:  
  
> their candidate's shortcomings is because they're anti-abortion.

You know what I'm starting to think?  
I'm starting to think we should just lie to them.  

The New York Times is keeping track of Donald Trump's lies, he broke quadruple digits a long time ago, I believe.  (Don't remember the number, but it's not small.)  Anyway, he goes on Fox and lies, he lies on twitter, he lies at pressers, and nobody on the right gives a shit.  When Fox News points out a lie, Fox News ratings go down.  
  
So fuck it, why don't we just run a Presidential candidate who goes out there and says: 

>""You know what, I'm pro-life as fuck, life begins at attention, and anyone who says otherwise is a communist.  Also I believe in Medicare for All and a $21/hr federal minimum wage phased in over my four year term.  Also I shoot lots of guns all the time, just for the fun of it, big ones too.""  *wink wink*
  
The Republican *voters* wouldn't notice the middle part, just the bits at the beginning and the end.  Hell, Donald Trump once said that the Government should pay for your health care, because ""well someone has to do it.""  They didn't care, they were pro-public health care that week, to the left of Bernie if it meant aligning with Trump.  
  
We run our candidate, and we just lie, say whatever they want to hear (while winking at our base the whole time), then govern however we want to govern.  When they ask us questions about why we're expanding abortion rights, we'll just keep lying.  
  
>""Wait... President Effort, this would nullify all the trap laws in the nation!!""  
  
>""No it wouldn't.""  
  
>""It's called the 2020 Trap Law Nullification Act.""  
  
>""No it's not.""  
  
>""But Fox News is saying that the 2020 Trap Law Nullification Act will nullify trap laws nationwide!""  
  
>""Fox News is lying to you.""  
  
>*""Planned Parenthood is building a 60' tall granite sculpture in your honor, the plaque reads 'The day trap laws were nullified nationwide by President Effort's 2020 Trap Law Nullification Act,' and quotes you saying how pleased you were that trap laws were a thing of the past, and you were proud to have nullified them!!!""*  
  
>""Anyone who's seen my record knows that I am no friend of Planned Parenthood.""  
  
>""Your record says that you dramatically increased their public funding.""  
  
>""That's the wrong record.""
  
Then we just win!  I guess.  
  
If lying to the voters meant that we elected a President and a Congress that would act against climate change, would it be worth it?  Let's not mince words here, Democratic policies save lives, if the past eight years of fumbling through Obamacare had proved anything, it's proven that.  With that in mind, how many lives could we save if we did what the Republicans were doing?  Gerrymandering the states, unbalancing the judicial bench, targeted election laws... okay that last one feels gross... but you get the picture.  
  
We always think about the worst case scenario, but let's ask ourselves about the best case this one time: How much practical good could eight years of dedicated Democratic governance do for this nation?  Hell, I'll be arrogant, how much good could it do for the *planet?*  
  
Health care, wages, research and development, labor laws, financial regulations, tax justice, environmental protections.... we could use the tax code to incentive vaccine research, and federal revenues to fund promising-but-not-profitable technology.  We could save lives, and improve the quality of the lives we saved, not just for ourselves, but for the world.  
  
If we lied.

Edit: I was angry when I wrote this, which is probably obvious.  Look, I *love* Michelle Obama, and god knows there isn't as much traffic on the high road as there used to be, but taking the high road doesn't do anything to help the people that drown in Puerto Rico, the people that Hillary, or Bernie, or Barack, or Bill would have bent over backwards and jumped through hoops to save.

3538,"She will drop out of the earth tomorrow and they will target Pelosi, then Warren, etc. It takes them time but they create bogeymen out of politicians all the time. They play the press and social media (Jack from Twitter met with conservatives about anti-conservative bias on Twitter recently) and scream loudly about liberal bias until everyone starts doing the best both sides reporting you've ever seen. The solution is not to tell powerful voices of the left to stay silent, it is to amplify them and call out the press with their nonsense.

Just look at all the benefit of the doubt Ivanka Trump gets. She's apparently against separating children from parents if you listen to the press. Yet she hasn't said one word publicly. They are going off a so-called conservation she had in private with Trump. Same with Melania. 

We should fight this perception of liberal bias and counter these narratives with questions. Instead we try to get rid of strong voices.

Hillary helped raise 500,000 recently. She can do more in her capacity and so can the Obama's. Just because they are perceived as toxic doesn't mean we bow down to the Republicans.

Look at the cable news. If we give in, we'll be left with right wingers on one side and right wingers who hate Trump on the other with no way in. ",saintlyjuliet,e0zx1f0,hillaryclinton

In your comments, for one. 

She’s better than Republicans for racial, gender, and LGBT equality. 

Though she didn’t support gay marriage in her last campaign, and has said things like “superpredator” and “Women are the primary victims of war” in all seriousness. Her husband’s presidency used the Southern Strategy to win. He paused his campaign trail to go home and witness the execution of a black man too mentally-handicapped to know he was being killed - in order to appear a law and order candidate.

The fact that you're reducing her career down to connections and ""list of favors"" proves your perception of her. You won't give her credit for her accomplishments because she was wife to Bill. And also you make false claims to support your perception which is really disingenuous - to you the only reason she was senator was because she pulled strings... have you even taken a moment to look at what she did as Senator of NY?

And btw she did run against primary candidates - they lost the first time and even harder the second time because she served NY well. There's a reason they love her in NY.  You're insinuating a lot of things here... why don't you back them up with facts?

And yes she did win handily in the 2016 primaries - she beat Bernie by almost 3 million votes - that's not close at all. In 2008 she lost to Obama by less than300,000 votes. So yes her victory in the 2016 primary was more than comfortable. If you disagree and want to imply it was rigged (like y'all usually do) then provide receipts instead of hurt egos.

You might not like her but at least you should know some facts about her instead of resorting to the tired ""establishment"" bullshit. I don't like Bernie and I can give you a list of FACTS why. You're even making up shit about her Senate primaries now. That's ridiculous. At the least you should be able to justify your hate for her on actual facts.

>The more left populists like OSC win, the more people recognize they can win and succeed that way, until even the party can't fail to recognize it. 

Yeah sorry but AOC winning in NY isn't an indication of the leftist populist movement across the country and that's been proven with a lot of primary wins.  The party isn't going to automatically endorse far left candidates accross the country because states like NY elect them. And regardless, populist candidates have been running and they've lost - why can't you accept that? Bernie lost. And a lot of the candidates he endorsed lost as well. At the end of the day you can't look beyond the party when it's about your beliefs - sorry but there are democrats who are not ""far left"". And we're going to elect people who are not ""far left"".

There's been a lot of that.  Trump really fucked with the fabric of our nation.

That same day my grandmother wrote a letter back, outlining the importance of the word of Christ, the 10 Commandments, and how little her ministers knew about what it means to be Christian.

Obama will be a popular choice, simply because he was a President they put a lot of effort into smearing and will likely remain a significant Democratic voice for the foreseeable future.  (Him being a minority still plays into the identity politics argument of the article too, of course.)

But it's painfully obvious when you look around that it's largely a misogynistic angle they take.

He called Hillary Clinton unqualified to be president, and lied that she had made the same comment about him, after he suffered a bad loss in early April. The primary was -over- in April, but Bernie still tried to attack Clinton. Then in JUNE, he offered to debate Donald Trump on live television (again, after Hillary was the presumptive nominee... all Bernie wanted to do was give himself, and Donald Trump, some more of the spotlight).

His supporters then protested the convention, booed over Elizabeth Warren, chanted ""NO TPP"" over Barack Obama, booed Marcia Fudge, booed civil rights leaders, booed Sarah Silverman when she said ""Bernie or Bust"" is ridiculous. They literally attempted to eat beans and simultaneously fart to clear the building (yes, this actually happened https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/sanders-fans-plan-dnc-fart-protest-clinton-nomination-n611596)

Sanders enabled that behavior by making his most volatile supporters his delegates. They even booed *HIM* when he said to elect Clinton (https://youtu.be/rTH6YdbM-WA). He created this monster and never tamed it or took responsibility. He never condemned their actions toward Roberta Lange, he never condemned them throwing dollar bills at Hillary's motorcade as if she was a stripper, he thanked a man for introducing him at a rally after that same mad had just called Hillary Clinton a ""whore"" in his introduction.

Even in Bernie's own speech, he doesn't mention Hillary Clinton until ~12 minutes into the speech (aside from one throwaway line 'This election is not about Hillary Clinton'). Compare that to Hillary's 2008 convention speech when the first thing she does is giving a ringing endorsement of Barack Obama and helps redirect her supporters' passion and enthusiasm to him.",JodySalerno,dxeaaot,hillaryclinton

396,"- TL;DR … It seems to me (ISTM) Kushner has $0.9bn (line of credit) IOU due to MBS; Kushner greenlit Khashoggi; Bostani (RIP) & Tubaigy plus others butchered Khashoggi; Tubaigy et al are fucked; KSR full of shit.

-  **It seems to me that this is what really happened...**

- Jared Kushner was in debt to the KSR for arranging a line of credit of $900,000,000.

- MSNBC reported that Kushner Kushner owed 1 BILLION dollars in loans for his '666' Building in Manhattan on 07/02/2017

- Kushner ultimately got a loan from Qatar's ex-PM HBJ, who  agreed to invest at least $500 million through Al Mirqab, on the condition that Kushner Companies could raise the rest of a multibillion refinancing elsewhere. 

- I don't yet have proof, but it seems to me that HBJ responded to overtures from MBS. Naturally, Kushner owes MBS in favors as well as money. Without MBS, Kushner didn't have the line of credit he needed to offload 666 on August 3rd 2018.

- Jared Kushner ""greenlit"" Khashoggi

- MBS (Mr. Bone Saw) ordered Jamal Khashoggi murdered

- Mashal Saad al Bostani (who was himself killed by KSR security forces on October 18 2018) and Salah Muhammed A Tubaigy and others implemented the murder ordered by MBS
The murderers will probably be killed to ensure that this doesn't get back to MBS (Mr. Bone Saw).

5772,"Republicans are the corporate party because they take corporate money. A good chunk of the democratic party also take corporate money. The difference is that usually all the Republicans fall in line with the establishment so they can actually push through their gross agenda while the democrats are almost always split on every issue because half of them take so much money from the rich, so whatever gets done is an extremely watered down version of what the left actually wants. 

Obamacare is a great example. What the left wanted was a single payer Healthcare system, but Obama (who was a great president don't get me wrong) didn't like negotiating, so he went right to the compromise which would have been a public option. Republicans used this as an advantage by then making a compromise of the compromise: an individual mandate system which is the old-school republican idea.

War is another great example. When Obama took office, he didn't hold Bush or the republicans accountable for entering a war with a country that didn't attack us. In fact, he expanded it by getting us into 7 interventions (trump got us into an 8th one). 

The most embarrassing one might've been when Obama introduced gun reform and an incredibly watered down background check didn't even pass. 

Republicans have taken the democrats shift to the middle as an opportunity to go extremely right-wing. This happened because democrats thought people would think the democrats would seem so much more reasonable by compromising, but humans are inherently tribalistic and many don't actually care about the policies, they care about their team winning. Donald Trump is a great example, who rallied against war in the primaries and Republicans backed him up (nows he's super pro war and Republicans are still backing him up because this is about ""yea that's my guy, that's my team, go us"" mentality). 

Basically what I'm saying is that if democrats stop taking corporate money, real progressives will win primaries because they aren't facing up against fundraising (by the very wealthy) from the economically center right democrats and there will be more than just a few real progressive voices in Congress. Then I think we can finally work on getting money out of politics. 

I view getting money out of politics as endgame because Republicans are really good at using their massive amount of money to advertise their policies that hurt the middle class to the middle class. (for example the estate tax was turned into the ""death tax"" because people went ""Oh shit, I'm gonna die. I don't want that to happen to me"" when it only affects an incredibly small amount of people and their bratty kids still get loads of money.

Thats more than just false. He just says, that being a progressive is more important for him to support other candidates than being black or a women. He just puts the ideas of a candidate first. I can't see a problem there.. as I said, of course we should support a minority/poc or women over majorities/white men - but their policies even above that.


> You guys need to stop conflating gender in this way and behaving like support for a woman or a minority is just down to the identity.

Than stop saying Bernie wants to dismiss identity politics because he says exactly the same that you just said. (""I supported Hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. I didn't support Palin cause she was a woman."") That means, that you supported Clinton because of her ideas and not because of her being a women and you didn't support right-wing women because of their politics. Thats exactly what Bernie says (""Being a latina is not enough"") but it still matters because ""We need 50 women in the senate. We need more African Americans."".

> So again, no one is saying that someone should be elected just because they're a woman or black or latino. Only Bernie is saying that.

-Richard Nixon barely lost the presidential election of 1960, then decided to run for president again and won in 1968.

So not only is there precedence for a candidate who won the popular vote running again and winning, but there's also precedence for someone who already ran for president and lost running again and winning.

And in fact, *every* person who won the popular vote for president and lost the election who then ran again *all* won the next time. Of presidential candidates who won the popular vote but weren't elected president, there are only those who won on their next run (Jackson, Cleveland) and those who just didn't run again (Samuel Tilden, Al Gore) who nevertheless would've had strong cases if they'd wanted to run again.",blitheobjective,e8o5dhv,hillaryclinton

Do you think a person like her would have been elected Senator twice if she didn't have intimate access to a former 2-term POTUS's rolodex, staff, and list of favors to call in -- such as making sure the other primary candidates in the blue state to which she had just moved, withdrew before she entered? And... she won ""handily"" in 2016? Yes I am afraid we are operating from different dimensions.

For the record though, I do assume there would be ""this partisan politics at play,"" not sure why anyone thinks that would have evaporated. I did agree were she elected it would be vastly preferable to what we have now, that's why I voted for her in November and urged my peers to do the same. But with an ability to pursue her own agenda? Don't see how.

The more *left* populists like OSC win, the more people recognize they *can* win and succeed that way, until even the party can't fail to recognize it.

The F****king hypocritical GOP gets on my damn nerves. The woefully ignorant and those who didn't vote make me sick every damn day! And these people see nothing wrong in Donald Drumpf.

There have been countless examples of Trump v any other political individual and nobody gives a hoot. Mark my word, I long for the day Trump resigns. So help me GOD because this indivudal should not be at 1600 Penn. Everything he does is out of spite and ego, with ignorance magnified tenfold. He speaks gibbrish, communicates in lies, lies lies and lies. All of these people LIE!  AND the F####king Ryan and McConnel say 'oh well' our voters are too stupid.

Never again, never again shall there be another Trump. The stakes were very clear and present, and throughly explained leading up to the election, and significant parts of Wisconsoin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio (I think) all said Let's try this guy. ""LETS TRY THIS GUY"". A know-nothing, endemic narcissist, corrupt, lying, sexual harasser, self-aggrandizing, pompous, caustic, rude, man! Whose whole character SCREAMED not PRESIDENTIAL.

Yet people have the nerve to complain today ""Oh my God, he tore up the IRAN deal"" This man said during the debates that he had no qualms bombing families and the causalties that came with that! Is America so F****ing Stupid! ( I Know the answer is no.... Just 3 states... I get it) But still, EVERY single DAMN DAY--corruption and ineptitude flows from the head down constantly, consistently--and this party--this dead party of LINCOLN, emulate chagrin and indifference. It's sickening, Absolutely sickening!

But my GOD--the nerve from some journalists to media outlets that these people had to put TRUMP and Former First Lady, Secretary, Senator, Magna Cum Laude on same playing field! Just a Joke!

And the stain, from History onward will not be kind to America. We need a course correct like yesterday! Vote, encourage others to Vote, Trump and his cohorts cannot continue in this manner of violating norms, and denigrating institutions. It just cannot be. 

Forgive me for the rant, but I just get tired of these nonsense headlines, consistent corruption Pruitt, Conway, Munchin/Manchin, and Trump! He lies, and then acts stupid about it.

2639,"My career's in tech infrastructure and security (more infra than security, but I'm not ignorant), so that's where my perspective is focused here.

Would there be direct evidence?  In a well-run setup, possibly. Depends on how good the hackers were.

In almost any of these setups?  Fuck no.  

All the circumstantial evidence others are complaining about is *probably* the best the public's gonna get.  I can't speak to legal status, but in the tech world, the evidence Michael Harriot laid out in this piece is more than enough to answer the kinds of questions we tend to have.  Those questions boil down to essentially one:

Given the available metadata (logs, audit trails, system monitoring histograms, diffs between backups and live data, etc), *can we trust that this system wasn't tampered with*?

That question itself is generally made up of two smaller ones:  What *do* we know? and What *can* we know?  I almost started basically typing out the article in my own words, but I'll skip that part.  Between how badly-secured these systems were (both design and implementation, and all the way from end-user to database backends), how badly audited and logged they were, and how badly backups were kept (if any), I think most competent professionals would generally agree on these points:

* We know attackers gained access to live voting systems/databases

* We know end-user voting machines are embarrassingly easy to gain access to.

* Due to bad security practices of many kinds, and in at least one case deliberate deletion of backups, *it is not possible* to verify whether or not data was changed in many of these cases.

In the computer security world, if you can't verify something, being thorough means you must assume the worst-case scenario.  How you deal with it depends a lot on context but to stay focused: This means that we as technical professionals *must* assume rolls and votes were tampered with.

The malfeasance and incompetence continually demonstrated over the course of the last two decades or so of modern electronic voting in the US has the general public in a position where anyone with a strong enough political lean can accept or dismiss the available data as they wish.  The pattern-matcher in me wants to think that's on purpose but that's neither here nor there.

As an industry expert, the 'case' presented in this article is highly convincing.  ""Can we trust that these systems were not tampered with?""  No, full stop.  Will we ever have *direct* evidence that votes were changed? Given the mismanagement involved, I very strongly doubt that.  Is that enough for a legal case? I have no idea. If I were brought in to fix the situation? This is more than enough.",tuba_man,e3537y7,hillaryclinton

Her husband’s presidency used the Southern Strategy to win.

> The searches open a new front for the Justice Department in its scrutiny of Mr. Trump and his associates: His longtime lawyer is being investigated in Manhattan; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is facing scrutiny by prosecutors in Brooklyn; his campaign chairman is under indictment; his former national security adviser has pleaded guilty to lying; and a pair of former campaign aides are cooperating with Mr. Mueller.

> That is significant because Mr. Manafort&#039;s lawyers have challenged Mr. Mueller&#039;s mandate as overly broad.Mr. Cohen is a longtime lawyer and fixer who, in a decade at Mr. Trump&#039;s side, has served as a reliable attack dog against real or perceived threats to Mr. Trump.

> Asked last week why Mr. Cohen made the payment, Mr. Trump replied: &quot;You&#039;ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney, and you&#039;ll have to ask Michael Cohen.""

You're proof of that.

Bernie will run in 2020 because of his massive ego, and it's an easy way to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars from poor people to him and his cronies. I mean, Hillary broke her arm several weeks ago when she accidentally stepped between Bernie and a microphone. 

So, let's assume he is. He will probably win Iowa because white people and caucuses. He will win NH because he's from a neighboring state. Then what happens in Nevada? That will be interesting, and where Bernie supporters lost their minds in 2016. Who comes out of the first 3 to challenge Bernie? 

Then SuperTuesday and the Southern primaries. This is when Bernie got crushed, and was basically mathematically eliminated. Of course, he didn't want to do the honorable thing, and concede. No, he wanted to stay in, so he could milk as much money out of you suckers for as long as possible. It worked! Bernie won 4 out of 13 states, with 2 being caucuses (of course) and 1 his home state. But now we have included California! 

So, does Harris run, and win California and most of the Southern states? That could be a big blow to Saint Bernard. Once again, getting crushed by Dems most reliable voting block - black women. If she doesn't run, does Cali give Bernie a huge boost? Could happen.

Does Bernie win enough delegates early because of the other Dems splitting the votes, so he can win - just like Trump? 

Does the Dems concede early, so that doesn't happen? 

Does someone come out of nowhere to take it like often happens?

Do Dems challenge Bernie, and does he actually get vetted by the media and his opponents? 

Does Biden run to save the Dems from Bernie and Trump? 

Who knows, but yes I think it would be a mistake to ignore Bernie, and treat him with kid gloves like last time.... ",king-schultz,dxlbm5r,hillaryclinton

The only time they really lost was because of the financial crisis. Other than that, they win by keep drumming up the boogie-man (Hillary). As long as they keep dragging her out, they will keep winning. Everyone is excited for 2018, sorry, they will keep both houses because they will keep running against Hillary. If she would get out of the public eye maybe *MAYBE* the left could win. I am not saying it is fair, I am saying it is reality. I voted for Hillary every chance I had. Facts are Facts. They win because they successfully branded her the villain. They won't lose until the left moves on from their current leadership (all in their 70s) and bring in new leaders. At least the right will have to work and branding new villains. 

Again, Donald Trump is the president. Donald Trump, a reality star buffoon. That is how successful the right was at branding Hillary the boogie-man. Donald Trump wouldn't have beaten any other candidate.

Take Mike Pence.  I'm a Liberal, I cannot stand the mans policies.  However, after the #MAGABOMBER attacks he *immediately* came to the defense of the targeted victims.

There would be very few non-incumbents with that sort of experience, so it's a little ridiculous to expect it as a prerequisite for the same reason it's silly to expect ten years experience for an entry level job.

> It goes without saying that as we fight to end all forms of discrimination, as we fight to bring more and more women into the political process, Latinos, African Americans, Native Americans — all of that is enormously important, and count me in as somebody who wants to see that happen.

And then: 
> “Right now, we’ve made some progress in getting women into politics — I think we got 20 women in the Senate now. We need 50 women in the Senate. We need more African Americans.”

Only after this, hes says that being a Latina is ""not good enough"". And concludes:
> In other words, one of the struggles that you’re going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics.

So it is just wrong to say that he is dismissing identity polictics, in fact it reads to me as a approach of intersectionality. Ben Carson ist black, but not necessarily better for black people than an average white democrat. Same with Condoleezza Rice. And even though you dont like Bernie, he is more in favour of women rights, than Sarah Palin would have been as Vice-President... so clearly I have to agree: Being black, a latina/-o or a women is not enough. Clearly we want to have at least proportinate representation of all members of the society and thats why he said ""we need 50 women in the Senate"" and why he said that we ""need more African Americans"".. that clear to everyone on the left. He then says that we have to go BEYOND identity politics, not to dump or dismiss it, but go beyond it, in other words: add progressive politics to it.

For me its really simple: I support the one with the best ideas - is it an advantage if the one is a person who experience discrimination? Hell yeah, if there is a good women, I'll take her over the men. A good black person, I take him or her over the white one and same for homosexuals and transgender. But still, having this attribute alone is not enough, I have to agree with the politics .. thats why I supported Bernie Sanders and not Hillary Clinton. If Elizabeth Warren would have been in the race, I would have routed for her and would have been angry at Bernie for not withdrawing and supporting her. And yeah.. if a black politician who has good politics would have been in the primaries I would have supported her and probably him.

That isn't the case and isn't how the electoral college works. Again, you don't understand it.

>How do you justify that when these certain states contribute less to the country than others?

Because this is a huge, diverse country and letting a handful of liberal urban centers control literally every single presidential election is stupid. We're a union of 50 states. It's in the fucking name of the country. Believe it or not, even those flyover states you hate so much deserve a say.

5387,"Great read. Especially in context of Hillary supporters and the validation of what we've been talking about since Nov 2016. Comey's book and his shameless promotion seem to have finally woken some members of the MSM about the impact of his announcement and the hypocrisy of his justifications. A little too late but at least there is acknowledgement in terms of slow realization. That gives me hope. 

>As Jonathan Chait explains, Comey’s willingness to let such concerns influence these episodes reflects the success of a decades-long campaign by Republicans and GOP-aligned media to skew the political dialog by hyping fake scandals, which in this case led Comey to act to “avoid charges of favoritism,” thus willingly handing bad-faith actors leverage over law enforcement. It’s hard to read Comey’s NPR interview as anything other than confirmation of this. Worse, Comey also revealed that not allowing this to happen would have been a perfectly appropriate outcome.


>All of this implicates the media’s conduct as well — both before and after the fact. Though Comey’s last-minute email revelation admittedly created a complicated editorial conundrum, it was widely hyped by the media in a manner that was surely disproportionate, given that at the time, no one knew whether the emails amounted to anything at all (which, it turned out, they didn’t). As Nate Silver has shown, the episode may have helped tip the election to Trump.


>**When supporters of Clinton made these points after the election, they were widely derided for being in denial about the real reasons Clinton lost.** The notion that Comey and related over-the-top press coverage might have played an important role was greeted — including by some neutral reporters — as self-evidently, uproariously, knee-slappingly absurd, as if it constituted nothing more than hopeless partisan brainwashing.

5592,">Why did Comey make that decision? His book, A Higher Loyalty, will be released on Tuesday. But accounts of its contents and excerpts published by outlets that have obtained copies of the book make clear that he concedes that he believed Clinton was going to win. “It is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president,” Comey wrote, “my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls. But I don’t know.”

>This is an astonishing admission. Justice Department guidelines bar officials from making important disclosures related to investigations close to elections to avoid influencing them. Comey took it upon himself to decide that, based on his concern that keeping the news confidential could call the legitimacy of a Clinton presidency into question, he had to announce that the investigation was being restarted. But that was not his decision to make; the role of the FBI is to investigate crimes, it is not to use its authority to protect or harm the legitimacy of a given politician. A hypothetical Clinton administration’s legitimacy should not have been a factor in Comey’s decision whatsoever; Comey should only have been concerned with following the Justice Department’s guidelines, which exist to protect the integrity of the democratic process, and which Comey followed in the case of the Republican candidate.

The homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him he’s privileged and that’s why you won’t give him any money.

Even Trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  If white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.

A year ago I moved from Oklahoma to Los Angeles.  The two cultures are so vastly different.  The Democratic Party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country that’s why we are where we are at.  In Oklahoma where I was apart of the Democratic Party, the Hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in Oklahoma as sexist and say that’s why they wouldn’t vote for Clinton but at the very same time we had a female Republican governor running the state.  Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Arizona and many other “Red” states have had female governors while states like New York and California have not.

It’s not about privilege, race or gender it’s about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.

And in terms of relevance to this post -actually it is very relevant to both the post and the OP's comment especially if you read his full essay and understand what he's saying about gender roles (which the NPR article does not). 

His essay is a perfect example of how women face different standards from men. How they're judged differently from men.  And this comes out in his essay not from what he says about women but how he says it. He focuses on the woman who fantasizes about being subjugated. He focuses on the woman about choosing different parts of her self and soul. He doesn't apply that same standard to the men. That says a lot.

""I used to be a liberal Democrat but a few years ago I became conservative.""

""Liberals have shouted racism so much that it's lost its meaning and now people are more racist."" bla bla bla ""Identity politics."" 

Then he went on to say again that he doesn't like Trump and how polarizing Trump is and that when he and his wife were traveling internationally last year people would ask where they're from and he'd say American and they'd roll their eyes at him with ""ooh, *Trump*"" and he that didn't make him feel good and was embarrassing. 

So he's conservative, used to be liberal just a couple years ago, and hates Trump. But hates Clinton more?

I was also surprised at the level of contradiction, or declaration of intent about gerrymandering in California. There is a good argument that California is too big and it's constituents would be better served if was broken apart. Then David mentioned that his redrawing of the map would include 7 states that would have all voted for Clinton by a good margin.

The FBI opened its investigation into the Russia involvement AND trump's involvement in July 2016:

The New York Times would later report that Page’s speech in Moscow “was a catalyst for the F.B.I. investigation into connections between Russia and President Trump’s campaign.""

https://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/timeline-russia-investigation/

Comey has made it absolutely clear that from the very beginning the trump campaign was also under investigation. the date the investigation by the FBI started was July 2016.

Fact is that that knowledge was withheld from the voters/ public.
Another fact was that there was NO reason to tell the public about the Weiner emails and that the Justice department was against going public about this.

Comey fucked up badly and you should stick to the facts if you feel some strange need to defend him.

Did Sanders contribute to her loss? Yeah you're damn right he did.
When it was all too clear he had lost (after NY and especially after CA) he didnt concede but started to lie to his supporters he could still persuade the supers to vote his way, which was an outright lie.
For over  1,5 months he continued to attack Clinton and the DNC, all but preparing his supporters for the Wikileaks dump days before the convention.

By then his supporters had been convinced BY SANDERS that the DNC had rigged the primaries against him (he used the same rhetoric as trump btw) and they were ripe for wikileaks to ratfuck the left.

And afterwards? Did he really campaign for Hillary as he claimed?
Nope.
I saw his Hillary events: whenever he mentioned her name the crowds booed and he smiled, after which he diverted to his usual stump speeches.

In the 3 months Wikileaks started to dump the Podesta mails, did he ever address his supporters and warn them his own campaign emails wouldnt have looked very much different?

Did he ever warn his supporters Russia was playing them (while he now claims he knew?)?

He's a bitter POS who wanted Hillary to lose and who was planning his 2020 run instead of fighting trump.

That doesnt mean Hillary didnt make mistakes btw, her advertising and her general campaign relied too much on the old ways/ old methods, sure. But seeing how she still won by 3 million voted, Im pretty sure a strong Sanders support from after the CA primary would and could have made all the difference.

When that happened, it dominated the news cycle for awhile. Plus, the President revoking security clearances because he disagrees with them politically is not something that was done before Trump.

My interpretation of this is that Hillary would rather voluntarily give up her security clearance rather than having it *revoked* because 1) revocation would create a bigger news story, the press would rehash 2016, and more important issues would be ignored and 2) she doesn't want to take part in establishing this new precedent of the President revoking security clearances for people he doesn't like.

1671,"> (Even Clinton, had she edged this monster Trump only with a slightly different distribution of voters / better roll of the dice, would still be obstructed by this same GOP congress and GOP state houses, only possibly facing a Red Wave during midterms right now.) 

I'll actually disagree here especially in terms of the red wave - yes she might have had the GOP congress and senate but we all know she would have veto'd those tax cuts and not even allowed Obamacare to be changed. And as for the red wave - I don't think that would have happened because this is where her experience would have come in to play. I love Obama but his inexperience resulted in the dems losing the house but Clinton as president would have been far more experienced and politically shrewd. She was already anticipating 2018 even during the campaign. She was already advocating for a lot of the candidates who are winning now.

>One reason for that is a lot of people have grown disgusted with the limits of the status quo. One party found a way to validate that, the other wasn't in that position.

We're not in power because of people being disgusted with status quo. If that was the case the GOP wouldn't have won congress and senate in 2016. They kept power on the back of populist rhetoric. There was no validation here.

No one stuck their heads in the sand. That's kind of false. Democrats didn't pretend that everything was fine. They just engage that narrative on extreme rhetorics with false promises.

The only ""Elite out-out-touch complacency"" came from Trump. I feel like this a huge misrepresentation of what happened and is a result of the dangerous populist politics at play.

Your message about moderation I agree with completely. But there's no moderate populism. We just have to hope the right kind of candidate replies to it - one who has tangible plans and policies to address populist concerns beyond grandstanding and rhetoric. 

There's no point in being in power if you can't do anything with that power. If AOC and other populist candidates get elected under Trump and a GOP government then what's the point of their ideology and rhetoric if they can't make anything happen? ",FrankieGH,e5h0rd5,hillaryclinton

2692,"**Hillary Clinton was exactly right about Trump being Putin's puppet**

She tweeted, ""Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?""

Cue the flame emoji for a serious political social media burn.

Regardless of whether Clinton expected an answer to her tweeted question, she got one. The President of the United States clearly demonstrated to the world exactly which team he plays for: Russia.

""I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,"" Trump said at a news conference with Putin, regarding his belief that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

His message could not have been clearer: I trust what Putin tells me, despite what the US intelligence community uncovers about Russian election meddling.

Trump has been bashing the US intelligence community from day one of his presidency, famously labeling the Russia investigations as a ""witch hunt,"" and very publicly feuding with the FBI.

And Trump continues to be dismissive of them even now, despite the comprehensive report by the CIA, NSA, FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, all concluding with ""high confidence"" that there was Russian interference during the 2016 presidential campaign.

It may seem that Hillary Clinton's tweet predicted a disappointing display of Trump's allegiance to Putin, but Trump may just have fulfilled a prophecy that Clinton made before he was even elected president.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton famously called out Trump, implying that he would be Putin's ""puppet.""

""You encouraged espionage against our people. You are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list: break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do,"" Clinton said. ""You continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race.""

And she was right. Trump's clear anti-NATO remarks have generally aligned with Russia's sentiment about the organization; his expressions of admiration for Putin have played right into the Russian leader's hand.

And then came the fated Trump-Putin summit, and Trump's failure to condemn Russia for the coordinated cyberattacks during the 2016 presidential campaigns. This was particularly bold given that just last week, the Justice Department announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officials for interference in the election. Trump has, once again, proven that Clinton's prediction was spot on.

Heck, there's even a #SheWarnedUs hashtag on Twitter documenting all the times Hillary told us how the Trump presidency would pretty much unfold from the get-go.

With Trump's track record, there was no reason to believe Trump would not, once again, take Russia's side.

After today's press conference, Democrats and Republicans are both speaking out against Trump's comments, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating that ""there is no question that Russia interfered in our elections,"" and acknowledging the need to recognize that Russia ""is not our ally.""

John Brennan, the former CIA director labeled Trump's comments ""nothing short of treasonous.""

As members of both parties distance themselves from the President's comments on Putin and are largely still absorbing the shock of having an American president openly side with and embrace a known adversary of his country, the one glaring truth we must all accept is that it was possible to see this coming. And Hillary Clinton did.

After witnessing the summit, Clinton herself had tweeted a response to her initial question: ""Well, now we know,"" the tweet read.

She knew all along which team Trump would play on -- and by now we should, too.

Alright, suppose I humor this angle of yours - what actions of her supporters during the campaign back up your claim that they were alienating others?

\> **Her campaign included good things she did as First Lady.** If you read articles from the 1990s, they all call her the most politically-involved First Lady ever. Many articles are mad about this, saying that it’s an unconstitutional expansion of the executive branch. She could show up at an event and it was like the President had shown up - like there were two Presidents. Her time as First Lady then launched the rest of her political career. Her husband campaigned for her, and her campaigns followed the Clintonism script quite exactly. 

That was a tiny part of her campaign. Barely touched on it. You know why? Because she's done way more stuff beyond that. It's very clear that you don't even know what her campaign was about if you're reducing the sum total of it on how she was as a first lady. And despite that, you're still focusing and basing your judgment on how her husband governed.

If they win, they’ll do great things for America. And we could finally see some congressional oversight of the White House.

>When the dust settles, we have to do some serious housecleaning. After Watergate, Congress passed a whole slew of reforms in response to Richard Nixon’s abuses of power. After Trump, we’re going to need a similar process. For example, Trump’s corruption should teach us that all **future candidates for president and presidents themselves should be required by law to release their tax returns. They also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules.**

>**A main area of reform should be improving and protecting our elections**. The Senate Intelligence Committee has made a series of bipartisan recommendations for how to better secure America’s voting systems, including **paper ballot backups, vote audits, and better coordination among federal, state, and local authorities on cybersecurity.** That’s a good start. Congress should also repair the damage the Supreme Court did to the **Voting Rights Act by restoring the full protections that voters need and deserve**, as well as the voting rights of Americans who have served time in prison and paid their debt to society. We need **early voting and voting by mail in every state** in America, and automatic, **universal voter registration** so every citizen who is eligible to vote is able to vote. We need to **overturn Citizens United and get secret money out of our politics**. And you won’t be surprised to hear that I passionately believe it’s time to **abolish the Electoral College**.

>But even the best rules and regulations won’t protect us if we don’t find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and **rekindle our civic spirit**. There are concrete steps that would help, like greatly expanding national-service programs and bringing back civics education in our schools. We also need **systemic economic reforms** that reduce inequality and the unchecked power of corporations and give a strong voice to working families. And ultimately, healing our country will come down to each of us, as citizens and individuals, doing the work—trying to reach across divides of race, class, and politics and see through the eyes of people very different from ourselves. When we think about politics and judge our leaders, we can’t just ask, “Am I better off than I was four years ago?” We have to ask, “Are we better off? Are we as a country better, stronger, and fairer?” **Democracy works only when we accept that we’re all in this together.**

1640,"Yeah we're completely on different planets and that's probably because you have a specific, misconstrued opinion of Clinton:

>It's a pretty powerful trend that the party opposite that of the President gains in midterms

Yes the trend is that the opposite party gains the midterms but trends are not concrete. And that's my point - Hillary knew even when she was running how important it was for down candidates to succeed. You might not agree based on your opinion of her, but she would have made it a priority to get Dems back in power which is what Obama failed at when he became president. She is just more politically astute.

>and Clinton's skills (even her most ardent supporters usually admit) weren't those suited to the bully pulpit and rallying public pressure. 

And this is completely false. You won't see any ardent supporters admit to this because it's completely false. There's a difference to being suited to the bullying pulpit vs getting attention from the media. I don't think you should misrepresent her skills by tying in her supporters. Her supporters know better than anyone else what she can do. Do you think a woman like her would have elected senator twice, run for the nomination in2008 when she lost by a 1% (she probably won the popular vote) and then run again and win handily if she didn't have the skills suited for the ""bully pulpit""? 

>Let's face it, we'd be mid-impeachment trials right now.
And this is where you betray yourself - what exactly what she be impeached about? This is the argument people used to dissuade independents not to vote for her but there's no basis. There's literally nothing that she could be impeached for.  This is the argument the far left uses as a justification for her not being in office which is ridiculous.

>But despite her triangulation she'd be getting obstructed by the whole right as a communist, and from a much more unchastened left as a neoliberal. Not a recipe for productive success.

And again... you assume there would be this partisan politics at play. She might have got obstructed from the right but she could have also prevented all the destructive things Trump and the right have enabled - tax cuts... obamacare under threat... CHIP... DACA... muslim ban... the Paris agreement. All of those things would have been prevented if she was president even with a GOP congress and senate. And the only people on the left who would call her a neoliberal as a negative label (because these people only care about labels) are not in the government.

Either ways, liberal values and policies would be far more protected than they are now even if populist candidates like AOC win. Cause they can win but how do they exactly hope to achieve their socialist rhetoric under a Republican president whether it be Trump or Pence. They have no plan to achieve their ideologies. What's the point then?

2486,"My career's in tech infrastructure and security (more infra than security, but I'm not ignorant), so that's where my perspective is focused here.

Would there be direct evidence?  In a well-run setup, possibly. Depends on how good the hackers were.

In almost any of these setups?  Fuck no.  

All the circumstantial evidence others are complaining about is *probably* the best the public's gonna get.  I can't speak to legal status, but in the tech world, the evidence Michael Harriot laid out in this piece is more than enough to answer the kinds of questions we tend to have.  Those questions boil down to essentially one:

Given the available metadata (logs, audit trails, system monitoring histograms, diffs between backups and live data, etc), *can we trust that this system wasn't tampered with*?

That question itself is generally made up of two smaller ones:  What *do* we know? and What *can* we know?  I almost started basically typing out the article in my own words, but I'll skip that part.  Between how badly-secured these systems were (both design and implementation, and all the way from end-user to database backends), how badly audited and logged they were, and how badly backups were kept (if any), I think most competent professionals would generally agree on these points:

* We know attackers gained access to live voting systems/databases

* We know end-user voting machines are embarrassingly easy to gain access to.

* Due to bad security practices of many kinds, and in at least one case deliberate deletion of backups, *it is not possible* to verify whether or not data was changed in many of these cases.

In the computer security world, if you can't verify something, being thorough means you must assume the worst-case scenario.  How you deal with it depends a lot on context but to stay focused: This means that we as technical professionals *must* assume rolls and votes were tampered with.

The malfeasance and incompetence continually demonstrated over the course of the last two decades or so of modern electronic voting in the US has the general public in a position where anyone with a strong enough political lean can accept or dismiss the available data as they wish.  The pattern-matcher in me wants to think that's on purpose but that's neither here nor there.

As an industry expert, the 'case' presented in this article is highly convincing.  ""Can we trust that these systems were not tampered with?""  No, full stop.  Will we ever have *direct* evidence that votes were changed? Given the mismanagement involved, I very strongly doubt that.  Is that enough for a legal case? I have no idea.

I randomly checked in here, don't think I've been here since 2016, and I was surprised by the tweet. I didn't think Hillary was still active politically and I didn't know this sub was active either. 



This post reached r/all, and I saw a comment that was basically the same reaction I had to seeing it. Then I saw it was getting downvoted, and the user I've been going back and forth with was being very personal and hostile toward that person. It reminded me of the general feeling I've always had when I come here. I unsubbed a long time ago because the culture here is actually kind of toxic. So I said something along those lines. 


I notice the same things in r/politics. So many conservatives have liberal stances when you question them in a way that doesn't trigger them. So many of them are looking for the door. But they feel unwelcome by liberals, because there is an endless stream of shaming and ridicule toward them. This approach will never persuade anyone. It drives people to entrench themselves. If you want people to join you, you have to respect where they currently are and seek common ground and common goals, then maybe if you're lucky the differences will become common ground too. For such a prominent political figure it's always struck me as bizarre how exclusive and hostile her subreddit is. 


Liberals seem so convinced that they have the moral and intellectual high ground that they're oblivious to how they are perceived and how much they alienate potential allies. I don't care about mean comments from internet strangers. It was annoying for maybe a few minutes. I care about unifying the lower and middle classes. Projection and lack of mutual respect is a pervasive issue and a major obstacle to that. I commented because of the condescending hostility I saw toward another user for having the wrong reaction to the post. This sub and this public figure got some rare visibility on this site and screwed it up. It makes Hillary and liberals look bad. I think a lot of people have checked in here and decided not to stick around. There's no reason why Hillary couldn't have a  comparable presence to Bernie on this site.

Her advertising in the general almost totally ignored policy, and the vast majority of her ads almost exclusively focused on ad-hominem attacks and Trumps unfitness for office. Which no other political campaign in advertising history has done to the degree her campaign did.

Trumps campaign, in contrast, stuck to a more traditional advertising strategy of comparing and contrasting policy.

So considering the vast, vast majority of Sanders voters voted for Hillary in the general I think I'm gonna have to point more towards a bad general campaign and a historically weird advertising strategy than anything involving Sanders as a primary cause of her loss.

They should of just stuck with the tried and true method of compare and contrast advertising like she did in the primary against Sanders. But instead they gambled on a novel advertising strategy against Trump, and lost.

I did. How did I manage that? 

> And what does her husband's strategy have to do with her? 

Her campaign included good things she did as First Lady. If you read articles from the 1990s, they all call her the most politically-involved First Lady ever. Many articles are mad about this, saying that it’s an unconstitutional expansion of the executive branch. She could show up at an event and it was like the President had shown up - like there were two Presidents. Her time as First Lady then launched the rest of her political career. Her husband campaigned for her, and her campaigns followed the Clintonism script quite exactly. 

If the accomplishments of the White House when she was First Lady count, so do the failings.

https://twitter.com/LisaTalmadge/status/891714303438532608

It shows how Hillary was always there for us, how she worked behind the scenes, showed support for Aids patients (which Sanders NEVER did), showed up in lgtb parades (which Sanders never did) and how she worked to advance lgtb rights in her time as  SOS.

you can start by reading this excellent thread by MrWeeks, documenting Hillary's life long commitment to the cviil rights movement:

But stating Hillary defended the status quo, when in fact she was there for us for 30+ years or even worse: saying she wasn't a champion for women, makes you a first class asshole.

And your pathetic: ""but I voted for her"", is about as genuine and dishonest as the average trump supporter.

2248,"> If you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.

I never said this. Nobody actually ever says this. They say (something like) having white skin is a privilege.  That's different than legit thinking that all white men are privileged. I mean, obviously, we people in Los Angeles don't think this.  We see white homeless folks every day.  The right willfully misinterprets this, just like they did with Black Lives Matter (Too)... not (Only) Black Lives Matter.  To be honest, I'd like there to be a better word than 'privilege,' because it gets easily misinterpreted... but, then, when you have a massive machine trying to discredit liberals who want to get rid of the bigoted oppression of individuals based on what 'group' they belong to, any phrase you use will get twisted to be intentionally misunderstood.   

""Sad to say but Democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican.""  This is far from true.  Most Republicans voted for Trump.  He is a fascist bigot who openly stated he wanted to ban all Muslims from entering America.  You are engaging in a false equivalency.  

""It’s not about privilege, race or gender."" For people who are oppressed, daily, based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion?  Yes, it is about that.  A poor black dude faces oppression that a poor white dude does not.  This doesn't mean a poor white dude has an easy life - that's not how existence works.  Like, the fact that my skin color doesn't cause me to be oppressed... that doesn't mean my life is sunshine, roses, gold, and happiness. 

It's just that society does not oppress a poor white dude because of his whiteness. 

The greatest trick ever pulled was to oppress people based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion... And then, when folks try to fight back against identity-based oppression, yell that the folks pushing back against that evil are the ones engaging in divisive 'identity politics.'

He specifically said about Russia that they didn't ""know they had anything"" at that point but at the same time he didn't know he ""had anything"" with the emails they found on Weiner's laptop (and eventually there was nothing) yet he felt the need to disclose THAT investigation and not the other.

New data makes it clear: Nonvoters handed Trump the presidency
https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump
5-7 minutes


Then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shakes hands as he arrives at a campaign rally on Aug. 30, 2016, in Everett, Wash. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)

Most of our assessments of the electorate in 2016 are dependent on estimates. Polling before the election that suggested where people were leaning; exit polling after the fact that gives us some sense of who actually turned out. When more than 137 million people vote, understanding exactly who they were and why they voted the way they did necessarily involves some guesswork.

On Thursday, though, Pew Research Center released an unusually robust survey of the 2016 electorate. In addition to having asked people how they voted, Pew’s team verified that they did, giving us a picture not only of the electorate but also of those who didn’t vote. There are a number of interesting details that emerge from that research, including a breakdown of President Trump’s support that confirms much of his base has backed him enthusiastically since the Republican primaries.

The data also makes another point very clear: Those who didn’t vote are as responsible for the outcome of the election as those who did.

As we noted shortly after the election, about 30 percent of Americans were eligible to vote but decided not to, a higher percentage than the portion of the country who voted for either Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Pew’s data shows that almost half of the nonvoters were nonwhite and two-thirds were under age 50. More than half of those who didn’t vote earned less than $30,000 a year; more than half of those who did vote were over age 50.


Pew’s data allows us to see very specifically how voter turnout and candidate support compare. By looking at the preferred candidate in a demographic group and then comparing the density of that group in the population that voted with the density in the nonvoting population, we get a sense for how nonvoters determined the 2016 results.

We’ll start simply. Women tended to prefer Clinton to Trump and made up a higher percentage of the voting population than the nonvoting population. That split alone helps explain Clinton’s popular-vote victory.


But “women” contains multitudes. Black, working-class Democratic women; white, wealthy Republican women. The split by party shows how that makes a difference: Republicans made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool and, unsurprisingly, broadly supported Trump.


(Remember: We’re not comparing actual turnout to the pool of registered voters — we’re comparing percent of voters to percent of nonvoters. In a world where voting doesn’t vary by demographic, the percent of voters from any group would be the same as that group’s percentage of nonvoters. If a demographic group votes less than another, though, it will be below the centerline while the other group is above it.)

Looking at race and ethnicity, we see how the heavier turnout of white voters affected the contest. Black and Hispanic voters voted much more heavily Democratic than white votes backed Trump, but they turned out less.


While half of nonvoters were white, 74 percent of voters were.

An even more dramatic example of that comes when we look at age groups.


People under 30 preferred Clinton by 30 points but made up much more of the nonvoter population than the population that actually voted. A third of nonvoters were under 30; only 1 in 8 voters was in that age group.

Here’s what the income divide in Pew’s chart looks like.


Each of these demographic groups contains fragments of the others, of course. Some of those earning under $30,000 in income are Republican or black or female. If we overlap race and income, the dots above separate a bit.


Whites making more than $30,000 a year skewed Republican and made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool. Poorer whites and nonwhites generally made up more of the nonvoter pool than the voter pool.

Income and education generally correlate, but the chart looking at education and race is remarkably different from the chart above. College graduates leaned toward Clinton — but whites without college degrees voted heavily for Trump. Nonwhites without a college education were 40 percent of the nonvoter pool and only 1 in 5 actual voters.


Evangelicals were the most strongly pro-Trump of the religious groups of voters, and they represented more of the voting pool than the nonvoting pool. Black Protestants and Hispanic Catholics made up less of the voting population than the nonvoting population — and strongly preferred Clinton.


If we step back and look at the bigger picture — all the demographic data points from Pew’s analysis, including those above — the expected trend emerges.


Demographic groups that preferred Trump were three times as likely to be a bigger part of the voter pool than nonvoters. Among groups that preferred Clinton, they were about 50 percent more likely to be a bigger part of the nonvoting community.

Clinton nonetheless won the popular vote. But an increased turnout of under-30 voters in, say, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan could easily have changed the results of the history.",ostrich_semen,e406ba8,hillaryclinton

4382,"First of all I want to make it clear. I was Nd am super into Hillary. I gave her more money than I’ve ever given a candidate. I made hundreds of phone calls for her. I’m not into Bernie.

Cuomo has been fucking over NYC big time. He’s also complicit with the big democratic machine that’s making state government horrible. A lot of my pro Hillary friends haven’t liked Cuomo for years and support Nixon. Maybe more people from New York should chime in. On my Facebook feed there’s a lot of excitement around Nixon and not a single positive mention of cuomo. ",Turdsworth,dzd7b07,hillaryclinton
3122,"I'll go down the rabbit hole...

No need for the question mark, none of those sources are right of center. I will say that FiveThirtyEight and Politifact are much closer than WaPo. They also have much better track records for accuracy, but that doesn't mean what they cover and how they cover it is irrelevant. They do slant; all news orgs do. You just don't read anything except ones that are left leaning. Also, you began your complaining in the Hillary Clinton sub, so echo-chamber is probably dead on. What opposition did you expect to find? Who were you trying to convince?

Climate Change- We both can cite numerous academics that agree with our positions, but there is still plenty of debate going on about the extent of our effect on the planet. [HERE] (https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/climate-change-no-its-not-97-percent-consensus-ian-tuttle/) is a right leaning website that explains a few skepticisms about how ""certain"" scientists are.

Furthermore, your original complaint expressed your discontent with Republicans not voting to support the widely accepted views of climate change. However, the Pew Poll you referenced answered your own question it the numbers when it said, ""74% of Republicans and Independents who lean Republican believe it is possible to cut regulations and protect the quality of air and water..."" I think sometimes Reps get painted as not caring about the environment, which isn't true (according to this study). They just have a lot of confidence that there is another way to take care of the issue than target certain industries and jobs (coal specifically). 

Gun Control- The Gallup Poll you referenced was also comical. You are 100% right that the survey participants support stricter gun laws. Where it gets funny is where they suggest what regulations would work and which ones wouldn't. All the suggested prevention methods that are widely considered effective are laws we ALREADY have on the books. The 3 at the bottom where a true divide starts to take place are laws that have been proposed by Dems but never approved on a federal level. It would be logical to conclude that the Gallup Poll, taken only a month after the Parkland shooting, might be emotionally driven. If everybody says more needs to be done, but then they only promote laws that already exists, it could just be honest-to-goodness frustration and sadness. Not to mention the fact that only 42% of people reported owning a gun. Everybody seems to have an opinion, but only 42% of them actually know what they are talking about. 

As far as the next few topics you brought up, I believe you told me to shut up, typed out childish sounds, and then became self-conscious about the aesthetics of your post. Maybe you can forward that nonsense onto all the people who think like you do in this sub.

And we know she's strong enough to take it and strong enough to weather Republicans hating her and Russia doing everything it can to take her down including trying to craft a narrative that everyone hates her, despite the fact she won more votes than Donald Trump and the second-most votes in U.S. history.

What people aren't realising is that Russia and the GOP hate machine won't go away if Hillary doesn't run again. They are priming for anyone who wins the Dem nomination. Biden, Harris, Duckworth, Booker, Sanders, whomever, once they're the Dem nominee they will be just as hated and just as maligned online by an army of bots making it seem real and cool to hate them and the GOP will make them the devil incarnate like they did Hillary.

This GOP hate machine didn't even start with Clinton. It started with Obama, they made him the devil incarnate for the conservative base. But Obama was lucky that Russia didn't deploy all their evil plans to give the presidency to his opponent and now we are dealing with not only a deranged GOP but a hostile foreign interference to tilt our elections.

The FBI opened its investigation into the Russia involvement AND trump's involvement in July 2016:

""James Comey, the FBI director at the time, would later testify that the FBI in late July 2016 began investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump campaign associates were involved in those efforts. The New York Times would later report that Page’s speech in Moscow “was a catalyst for the F.B.I. investigation into connections between Russia and President Trump’s campaign.""

https://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/timeline-russia-investigation/

Comey has made it absolutely clear that from the very beginning the trump campaign was also under investigation. the date the investigation by the FBI started was July 2016.

Fact is that that knowledge was withheld from the voters/ public.

>I work for the president but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.

>Given the instability many witnessed, there were *early whispers **within the cabinet** of invoking the 25th Amendment*, which would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until — one way or another — it’s over.

>The bigger concern is not what Mr. Trump has done to the presidency but rather what we as a nation have allowed him to do to us. We have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility.

Confirmation bias is universal, y' know?  

So I decided to check it out.  This synopsis is courtesy of Hamilton 68:  
  
>*[The #walkaway movement, a campaign highlighting alleged discord among the left, got a boost this week from accounts linked to Russian influence operations. The first use of the #walkaway hashtag from accounts monitored on Hamilton 68 was noted in early June (a few weeks after the grassroots campaign began), but engagement remained relatively low throughout the month. Activity spiked on July 2, when Hamilton 68 noted 73 unique tweets using #walkaway, and roughly another 50 using related campaign hashtags (e.g. #walkawaymovement). The late engagement suggests Kremlin-oriented accounts are trailers rather than leaders of the campaign, but the high-level of current engagement indicates an effort to astroturf support for the movement and hijack the narrative. This includes several monitored accounts that have changed their handles to include the hashtag, or that have shared their own supposed walkaway moments. The campaign also received a direct boost from Russian propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik, both of which ran stories on the movement.](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/)*   
  
Keep your eyes out for attempts to divide our movement, and our party, in ways both blatant and subtle.  *We lost the 2016 by 80,000 votes,* less than a football stadium, we can't afford to be at anything less than full strength this year.  A moment's foray into r/WalkAway should tell the average user everything they need to know about the movement.
  
If you see someone using WalkAway talking points around social media, take the time to disarm them.  I'm still hearing people talking about the ""rigged primaries,"" a talking point that was [disproven](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/14/16640082/donna-brazile-warren-bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-rigged), so either Russia is playing its greatest hits, or people still believe it, or both.  
  
Our enemies will be pushing back at us just as hard as they did in 2016, and if they're smart they'll push back *even harder* now that they have an entire political party on their side, but we know what we're looking for, and how to defend against it.

I think it's fair to say that she is _less_ experienced than other potential candidates. She's certainly less experienced than Cuomo, who's had the job for almost eight years. But that's hardly the same thing as no experience; a governor works in advocacy, policy, and management. She's had decades of experience and is well respected in each of those areas. The most relevant attack you can use against her is lack of _breadth_ of experience, rather than depth, because until her candidacy she's been mostly laser focused on education policy.

3572,"She will drop out of the earth tomorrow and they will target Pelosi, then Warren, etc. It takes them time but they create bogeymen out of politicians all the time. They play the press and social media (Jack from Twitter met with conservatives about anti-conservative bias on Twitter recently) and scream loudly about liberal bias until everyone starts doing the best both sides reporting you've ever seen. The solution is not to tell powerful voices of the left to stay silent, it is to amplify them and call out the press with their nonsense.

Just look at all the benefit of the doubt Ivanka Trump gets. She's apparently against separating children from parents if you listen to the press. Yet she hasn't said one word publicly. They are going off a so-called conservation she had in private with Trump. Same with Melania. 

We should fight this perception of liberal bias and counter these narratives with questions. Instead we try to get rid of strong voices.

Hillary helped raise 500,000 recently. She can do more in her capacity and so can the Obama's. Just because they are perceived as toxic doesn't mean we bow down to the Republicans.

After Hoover, the FBI consciously made efforts to avoid even the appearance of impacting upon politics. Even Comey has talked about this. Comey set that aside because he was worried about the public perception of Loretta Lynch announcing that there would be no prosecution.

But he went further when he decided to announce it himself. He editorialized about her behavior in a way that the FBI never has before in regard to a case. Why? Please say something other than this case was different. Please offer some reasons why the FBI should behave so drastically different. If its not about affecting politics, why not just handle the case like every other?

Because it WAS about politics. Just not Democrat vs Republican politics. Comey was trying to maximize the perception of impartiality of the FBI. He was worried about public blowback at the decision and so he tried to walk this fine line.

If it was only about doing what was right he wouldn't have editorialized nor even given such a public press conference in July. If it wasn't about trying to placate Republicans he wouldn't have written those letters in October and November.

3065,I don’t know about that. I didn’t vote for Bernie in the primary. And a lot of what you said is true. But I don’t see it as his fault. He wasn’t the one claiming it was rigged. It was people like his jack ass campaign manager who complained about it being rigged. I like that Bernie is a senator and he has a more important voice than he did. I do hate the nasty rhetoric against Hillary to this day and will follow us until after she dies.

All he ever talked about was policy. Hillary Clinton was the one that constantly used meaningless clichés like ""we need to break down the barrier"" and ""better together"".

Bernie was trying to pull democrats to the left. When going down all of Bernie's policies the American people are almost always incredibly favorable of them. It's the democrats own fault for not doing enough to get the progressive vote.

Nobody was excited for Hillary. Trump didn't get a ton of votes, democrats just didn't show up at the polls because they were overconfident and they didn't want to vote for someone who wanted to keep the system that was fucking over the average person the same.

For me, I just don't want to see her brand of populism. She's right about a lot of economic issues but she also grand stands. I don't think she can be impartial when it comes to considering sensible legislation. If it a law even happens to benefit a bank or insurance company in anyway she will be obliged to blast it. And who knows where she will land on the US military. I can't envision her ever giving a tough military order. At least Trump knows to basically stay out of it. He talks and talks, but no one at Pentagon is listening. That's scary for all sorts of other reasons, but a more attached president would have had a major showdown with military brass by now.

2057,"You're equating the plight of white men with the plight of POC and women.

That's only something that you can do from a viewpoint that is racist in nature.

There's a good chance that you were called racist or sexist in relation to your behavior, but you didn't see your own behavior that way, so you think it's just because you're a white guy.

I'm a white guy.  I have never been called racist or sexist or anything of the sort, except for the relatively few times I deserved it.  It's not that hard.

EDIT:  You don't seem to understand that the plight of any individual white man is not related to his manness or his whiteness, so there's no need to defend those identities  (since they're not the targets of oppression)... that only makes sense from a white supremacist POV.

Yes, it is important to push back against the oppression of individuals based on their race, sex, orientation, religion, and gender.

White men are simply not oppressed based on their race or sex.  To act as though there's an oppression that needs to be pushed back against is white supremacy.

And I can't speak for all Hillary supporters, but I hate Bernie because he's basically a left wing version of Trump - full of hatred and anger, has a huge cult that will go to great lengths to defend him, constantly trashing the establishment and corporations (politics is an expensive business and not everyone is like Trump and can pay for it all themselves), trying to run for president in a party he wasn't involved with (and that Bernie attacks every opportunity he gets), over the top plans that are unrealistic and that aren't fully detailed, want to be president despite never doing anything of substance in politics and seeming to be in it because they want the title and prestige more than anything.  Bernie never did anything of substance in Congress.  People like Trump and Bernie claim to hate the establishment, but what they really hated was that there were people who had more power than they do.

The other thing that really stood out is that he came out of the game spouting conspiracy theories and partisan hackery.

2092,"A white man’s life is different depending on the city, state and region you live in and economics plays a huge role.  If you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.  I didn’t say white men are oppressed and I won’t say their privileged either, they live a human life.  The homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him he’s privileged and that’s why you won’t give him any money.

Even Trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  If white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.

A year ago I moved from Oklahoma to Los Angeles.  The two cultures are so vastly different.  The Democratic Party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country that’s why we are where we are at.  In Oklahoma where I was apart of the Democratic Party, the Hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in Oklahoma as sexist and say that’s why they wouldn’t vote for Clinton but at the very same time we had a female Republican governor running the state.  Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Arizona and many other “Red” states have had female governors while states like New York and California have not.

It’s not about privilege, race or gender it’s about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.  Sad to say but Democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican (Trump  is not average).  Obama brought people together Clinton divided.  We all lost when her campaign started dividing people and it started long before Trump got the Republican nomination.",MachoMug,e47k56u,hillaryclinton

 I have seen a lot of push back against Bernie recently which is good for the Democrats but is it too late? I don't know. I feel like the Democrats let him take over the conversation and have suffered because people like Tim Ryan, Jason Kander etc have been sidelined.

**Roger Stone Sought Information on Clinton From Assange, Emails Show**

*Ex-Trump adviser urged intermediary to ask WikiLeaks for specific dates of rival candidate’s communications*

By Shelby Holliday and  Rob Barry

Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone privately sought information he considered damaging to Hillary Clinton from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The emails could raise new questions about Mr. Stone’s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in September, in which he said he “merely wanted confirmation” from an acquaintance that Mr. Assange had information about Mrs. Clinton, according to a portion of the transcript that was made public.

In a Sept. 18, 2016, message, Mr. Stone urged an acquaintance who knew Mr. Assange to ask the WikiLeaks founder for emails related to Mrs. Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal in 2011 when she was secretary of state, referring to her by her initials.

“Please ask Assange for any State or HRC e-mail from August 10 to August 30--particularly on August 20, 2011,” Mr. Stone wrote to Randy Credico, a New York radio personality who had interviewed Mr. Assange several weeks earlier. Mr. Stone, a longtime confidant of Donald Trump, had no formal role in his campaign at the time.

In another email, Mr. Credico then asked Mr. Stone to give him a “little bit of time,” saying he thought Mr. Assange might appear on his radio show the next day. A few hours later, Mr. Credico wrote: “That batch probably coming out in the next drop...I can’t ask them favors every other day .I asked one of his lawyers...they have major legal headaches riggt now..relax.”

Mr. Credico said in an interview with the Journal that he never passed the message on to Mr. Assange or his lawyers, but “got tired” of Mr. Stone “bothering” him, and so told Mr. Stone he had passed along the message. Mr. Credico said he did so because he owed Mr. Stone a favor for helping him book Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson as a guest on his show.

Mr. Stone, in a text message to the Journal, said that Mr. Credico had “provided nothing” to him and that WikiLeaks never handed anything over. Both men deny ever having special access to WikiLeaks’ material.

“I never had possession or access to any Clinton emails or records,” Mr. Stone said, adding that his testimony before the House committee was “complete and accurate.”

Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the emails hadn’t been provided to congressional investigators. “If there is such a document, then it would mean that his testimony was either deliberately incomplete or deliberately false,” said Mr. Schiff, who has continued to request documents and conduct interviews with witnesses despite the committee’s probe concluding earlier this year said.

A lawyer for Mr. Stone, Grant Smith, said the emails hadn’t been turned over to House investigators because they were “not encompassed within the scope of the committee’s request.” Mr. Stone said the emails were preserved at the request of the Senate, which is also conducting a Russian interference probe. Mr. Smith said they hadn’t yet been given to investigators there.

The newly unearthed emails come amid signs that special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is examining Mr. Stone’s role in Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Among other matters, prosecutors have asked about Mr. Stone’s claim to have met with WikiLeaks during the campaign, according to a witness familiar with the investigation.

U.S. officials have said WikiLeaks received material from operatives working on behalf of Russia’s military intelligence group, which Mr. Assange has denied. The Kremlin has denied it meddled in the election.

Messrs. Stone and Credico said they haven’t been contacted by Mr. Mueller’s office, which declined to comment. WikiLeaks didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In the initial email, which included an attachment with photos of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and other documents, Mr. Stone sought to confirm speculation that Mrs. Clinton had unnecessarily supported the decision to “continue bombing Libya” during the height of the country’s civil war in 2011. The conflict ultimately led to Ghadafi’s killing at the hands of opposition forces. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Several weeks after Mr. Stone’s email request, on Oct. 3, 2016, an article ran on Infowars.com, a conservative news outlet to which he frequently contributed during the campaign. The article included some of the same images as Mr. Stone’s initial email to Mr. Credico, and didn’t include any unreleased Clinton-related emails or WikiLeaks material.

The emails appear to be consistent with Mr. Stone’s description in his sworn testimony of Mr. Credico as a “go-between” and an “intermediary” to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, according to a portion of his interview that was made public.

Mr. Credico, who considers himself a supporter of WikiLeaks, has publicly raised questions about the details of Mr. Stone’s claims and in recent weeks has called some of them false.

Mr. Credico said his relationship with Mr. Assange and his team didn’t begin until late August 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder agreed to do his radio show. By that time, Mr. Stone had already claimed to be in touch with Mr. Assange and appeared to predict the release of information damaging to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Stone now says he assumed Mr. Credico was in touch with Mr. Assange during that time.

After earlier asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the House probe, Mr. Credico now says he is willing to talk with investigators. He said he met on Wednesday with the committee’s Democratic staff members for what he called a limited conversation about WikiLeaks, the 2016 campaign and Mr. Stone.

As Mr. Credico has become more vocal about what he says are discrepancies in Mr. Stone’s account, Mr. Stone has responded with a series of threats, according to emails and text messages reviewed by the Journal.

In early April, in one of those emails, Mr. Stone accused Mr. Credico of serving as an informant.

“Everyone says u are wearing a wire for Mueller,” the April 7 email said. Two days later, Mr. Stone wrote: “Run your mouth = get sued.” Mr. Credico denies being an informant.

Mr. Stone said he was warning Mr. Credico against defaming him and urging him to “simply tell the truth.”",wenchette,dzk5hft,hillaryclinton

5523,"So I didn’t know where else to post this rant, but this round table has always been a good place to get shit off our chests.

I am so disheartened to hear (again) that the Great Barrier Reef is dying. (Specifically that half the reef died in the last year.) 

We’ve reached a point of no return. In the late 1800’s oil execs predicted that our carbon emissions would affect the atmosphere.

In the 1970s Scientific consensus was that global warming was happening and was caused by human activity.

In the 2000’s republicans claimed that human activity is not causing climate change and branded the truth, science, and factual information as a political issue.

I have always considered myself a conservative Democrat, a moderate, but lately I’m told that I’m a big state leftist.... and perhaps that is coming true.

In a classically liberal sense, the free market should solve our climate and environmental problems, but the market failed. The market failed when patents for electric cars were bought by fossil fuel interests. The market failed when propaganda convinced half of American voters that climate change is a myth. 

We have reached a point of no return.

The best we can hope for is an acclamation to our changing planet. Similarly to every conversation Americans (especially our representatives) should be having, regarding factual evidence based policy, one side just claims that there is no problem, and thus forcing anyone who is educated to take an extreme stance.  This applies to gun legislation, environment, immigration, automation, healthcare and so much more.

""Liberals have shouted racism so much that it's lost its meaning and now people are more racist."" bla bla bla ""Identity politics.""

So he's conservative, used to be liberal just a couple years ago, and hates Trump. But hates Clinton more?

""By one estimate, the Russians reached 126 million people on Facebook alone. And the kind of phony stories that they spread, claiming for example, that the Pope endorsed Donald Trump or that Hillary Clinton dealt arms to ISIS, those kinds of fake news stories actually had more social engagement and reached more readers than legitimate stories in the last three months of the campaign.""  

**Exhibit B: Russia's hacking of voter rolls**

""They penetrated voter rolls in at least 39 states. And we know from what the Senate Intelligence Committee said that in a small number of states, but possibly pivotal number of states, they changed the voter rolls, potentially disenfranchising Clinton voters who might have showed up to the polls and found out that they were not registered to vote.""

**~ ~ ""All of these things add up quickly in an election that was decided by fewer than 80,000 votes in three states."" ~ ~**

**Exhibit C: Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign** 

""The Russians began leaking these massive dumps of stolen emails through WikiLeaks on the eve of the Democratic convention, and the story line that emerged from those stolen emails was the the DNC was biased against Bernie Sanders. And then the next big tranche of documents was released, very significantly, 29 minutes after the Washington Post reported on the Access Hollywood video in which Donald Trump was heard bragging about grabbing woman by their genitals. And so that last-minute intervention by the Russians via WikiLeaks was incredibly important, which is why Donald Trump mentioned WikiLeaks 164 times in the last month of the campaign. 

~ ~""Nobody would suggest that the Russian intervention was the only factor behind the election outcome, but if you talk to experts like **former FBI agent Clint Watts, what he will tell you is that if it were not for the Russian intervention, Donald Trump would not have been within even striking distance of Hillary Clinton.**

**""I think we have great cause to fear for the security of our elections in 2018 and 2020.** Donald Trump benefited from the Russian intervention in 2016, Donald Trump probably would not be president if it weren't for the Russian intervention in 2016, and he shows very little interest in opposing the Russians."" ~ ~",BumBiddlyBiddlyBum,e3q8h8e,hillaryclinton

As for Trump, it was the combination of an agreement between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to not admit to anything that could look like an oversight or mistake, including not responding to Bernie Sanders and some crazy claims he was making against Hillary Clinton. Then factor in Obama's not so nice comment about the Heartland having a lot of Bible Thumping, Gun Loving, Bitter over losing jobs, people.

**Israeli Intelligence Firm’s Election-Meddling Analysis Comes Under Mueller’s Scrutiny**

*Psy-Group presentation outlines ways Trump campaign was helped by fake social media accounts*

By Byron Tau and  Rebecca Ballhaus

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators have obtained a presentation prepared by an Israel-based private intelligence firm that outlines ways in which Donald Trump’s 2016 election was helped by fake news and fake social-media accounts, according to people familiar with the presentation and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Mueller’s interest in the presentation suggests his investigation is focusing on the role of social-media manipulation during the 2016 campaign. Intelligence officials have said that cyber-influence campaigns, sometimes covertly sponsored by foreign governments, are expected to become a major part of political campaigning in the coming years.

The presentation consists of nine slides and was prepared by the Psy-Group, a firm that boasts of ties to elite Israeli intelligence agencies. It isn’t clear who received the Psy-Group presentation, but it appears to have been created sometime after the 2016 election.

People familiar with the presentation describe it as an internal analysis drawn up by the firm to drum up U.S. political business—saying that it was essentially used as marketing material for the firm’s operation and analytical capabilities. It also represents a “proof of concept” of how a firm like Psy-Group would have manipulated the 2016 campaign as well as future campaigns, people said.

It is unclear how much of the presentation consists of the firm’s analysis of online activity during the campaign and how much is a hypothetical pitch.

Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Mr. Zamel, said the presentation copy that Mr. Mueller has obtained was a “sample type analysis of what they could do.”

A spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment.

The presentation outlines the ways in which social media “bots” and fake online content were used to help energize voters supportive of Mr. Trump. One slide entitled “Trump Campaign Components” outlines a timeline where “fake news sites/avatars/content” were created during the early part of the election year and then leveraged to spread “uncertainty” by midyear. The final stage was “using fake bots to react to real life situations & further polarize the TA,” or target audience, the slide says.

Another slide says the firm identified 140 pro-Trump websites linked to a man in Macedonia. The websites “had American-sounding domain names such as WorldPoliticus.com” and “published aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the USA.” WorldPoliticus.com is no longer active.

A person familiar with Trump campaign’s operations said it has “absolutely no knowledge of what this firm was referring to” in the slideshow.

Another slide outlines a Facebook strategy where fake online profiles or “avatars” engage real people online and encourage them to share content. The result is a “multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies,” the slide says.

In September, Facebook disclosed that it identified about 500 “inauthentic” accounts with ties to Russia that bought $100,000 worth of ads during a two-year period encompassing the presidential campaign.

Mr. Mueller is investigating whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded in Russian efforts to interfere in the election. Moscow has denied meddling and Mr. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign.

The Psy-Group’s founder, Joel Zamel, is under scrutiny from U.S. investigators because of his close relationship with the government of the United Arab Emirates and his involvement in a meeting with Mr. Trump’s eldest son shortly before election day, the Journal has reported.

Mr. Zamel met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in the weeks before the 2016 election along with George Nader, a top adviser to the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, to discuss an offer to help boost the campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. Erik Prince, a U.S. defense contractor who specializes in the Middle East and had close ties to the campaign, attended the meeting, the Journal previously reported. People involved in the meeting say nothing came of it and the Psy-Group didn’t perform any work for the Trump campaign.

A lawyer for Mr. Trump Jr. said Messrs. Zamel and Nader had pitched his client on “a social media platform or marketing strategy” and that “he was not interested and that was the end of it.”

The presentation reviewed by the Journal wasn’t related to the Trump Tower meeting nor was it prepared for Mr. Nader, said Mr. Mukasey, Mr. Zamel’s attorney.

Mr. Mueller has been investigating Mr. Zamel’s work and has interviewed Mr. Zamel about his business relationship with Mr. Nader, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Mukaseyhas said investigators have told him his client isn’t a target of the probe. A subpoena concerning Mr. Zamel’s work, but not issued to Mr. Zamel, was reviewed by the Journal.

Mr. Nader has been cooperating with investigators since January, when investigators stopped him at Dulles Airport and served him with a subpoena.

A lawyer for Mr. Nader said his client has “fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation and will continue to do so.” The lawyer declined to answer further questions.

The Psy-Group was formed by Mr. Zamel, the son of an Australian mining magnate who moved to Israel to study counterterrorism. There, Mr. Zamel founded several companies beginning in 2010 and became increasingly close to the government of the U.A.E., the Journal has previously reported. One of his companies, Wikistrat, did war games and analysis for the U.A.E. in 2014 and say he was close to the national security adviser there, according to people familiar with Mr. Zamel.

People familiar with the Psy-Group’s operations say it provided intelligence services for political and corporate clients.

After the 2016 election, the firm started to pitch for business in the U.S., including for the 2018 midterms. As part of its pitch to potential political clients, the Psy-Group said it had the capability of leveraging fake social-media accounts, which they call avatars, on behalf of political campaigns.

“Psy excels at the use of online avatars that appear natural, unbiased and object. These avatars are highly effective at directing political messaging to target audiences,” marketing materials reviewed by the Journal say. These fake social accounts could be used for “narrative warfare” or to “echo campaign messaging,” the firm said.

No political entity has made any payments to the Psy-Group since 2015, according to Federal Election Commission records. The participation of foreign firms or individuals in U.S. elections is tightly controlled.

2697,"Tack-on 1:  
  
In related news, it *seems like* I've been seeing a lot more of ""this is why Trump won,"" and ""liberals think everyone is a Nazi,"" and ""give me something to vote *FOR,""* and ""Hillary Clinton can't be trusted"" than normal, but I could just be imagining things.  Confirmation bias is universal, y' know?  

So I decided to check it out.  This synopsis is courtesy of Hamilton 68:  
  
>*[The #walkaway movement, a campaign highlighting alleged discord among the left, got a boost this week from accounts linked to Russian influence operations. The first use of the #walkaway hashtag from accounts monitored on Hamilton 68 was noted in early June (a few weeks after the grassroots campaign began), but engagement remained relatively low throughout the month. Activity spiked on July 2, when Hamilton 68 noted 73 unique tweets using #walkaway, and roughly another 50 using related campaign hashtags (e.g. #walkawaymovement). The late engagement suggests Kremlin-oriented accounts are trailers rather than leaders of the campaign, but the high-level of current engagement indicates an effort to astroturf support for the movement and hijack the narrative. This includes several monitored accounts that have changed their handles to include the hashtag, or that have shared their own supposed walkaway moments. The campaign also received a direct boost from Russian propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik, both of which ran stories on the movement.](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/)*   
  
Keep your eyes out for attempts to divide our movement, and our party, in ways both blatant and subtle.  *We lost the 2016 by 80,000 votes,* less than a football stadium, we can't afford to be at anything less than full strength this year.  A moment's foray into r/WalkAway should tell the average user everything they need to know about the movement.
  
If you see someone using WalkAway talking points around social media, take the time to disarm them.  I'm still hearing people talking about the ""rigged primaries,"" a talking point that was [disproven](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/14/16640082/donna-brazile-warren-bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-rigged), so either Russia is playing its greatest hits, or people still believe it, or both.  
  
Our enemies will be pushing back at us just as hard as they did in 2016, and if they're smart they'll push back *even harder* now that they have an entire political party on their side, but we know what we're looking for, and how to defend against it.

Well, he never jumped on last-minute to ""co-sponsor"" everyone else's work, but other than that he ""accomplished"" about as much as HRC. Which is very little. Senators as individuals generally cannot accomplish anything without a filibuster-proof and veto-proof majority of their colleagues, and we live in the era of partisan gridlock.

> both are dismissive of intersectionalism

Really? Class is one function of intersectionalism. By arguing very clearly and explicitly that we can't assertively tackle economic class issues ""because we still have racism, sexism and homophobia in this country"", HRC was the one denying an intersectional approach, that we need to separate them and address them in sequence.

49,">There is something else that Mr. Trump does to facilitate violence against those he dislikes: He dehumanizes them. “These aren't people,” he once said about undocumented immigrants suspected of gang ties. “These are animals.”

>Research by Dr. Cikara and others shows that when one group feels threatened, it makes it much easier to think about people in another group as less than human and to have little empathy for them — two psychological conditions that are conducive to violence.

~

>As Dr. Fiske has written, “Both science and history suggest that people will nurture and act on their prejudices in the worst ways when these people are put under stress, pressured by peers, or receive approval from authority figures to do so.”

>**So when someone like President Trump dehumanizes his adversaries, he could be putting them beyond the reach of empathy, stripping them of moral protection and making it easier to harm them.**

>If you still have any doubt about the power of political speech to foment physical violence, consider the classic experiment by the Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram, who in the early 1960s studied the willingness of a group of men to obey an authority figure.

>Subjects were told to administer electrical shocks to another participant, without knowing that the shocks were fake. Sixty-five percent of the subjects did what they were told and delivered the maximum shock, which if real could have been fatal. The implication is that we can easily be influenced by authority to do terrible harm to others — just by receiving an order.

However, since you show you know absolutely nothing about Hillary:

For LGTB, you can read this excellent Twitter thread by long time LGTB activist Lisa Talmadge: it documents 30+ years of LGTB activism and solidarity from Hillary:

https://twitter.com/LisaTalmadge/status/891714303438532608

It shows how Hillary was always there for us, how she worked behind the scenes, showed support for Aids patients (which Sanders NEVER did), showed up in lgtb parades (which Sanders never did) and how she worked to advance lgtb rights in her time as  SOS.

About POC:
you can start by reading this excellent thread by MrWeeks, documenting Hillary's life long commitment to the cviil rights movement:

The mods of this sub have written down the thread in this sub:

Now I get it: you're one of those people who doesn't know anything about Hillary's record. You fell for the far right's propaganda. But stating Hillary defended the status quo, when in fact she was there for us for 30+ years or even worse: saying she wasn't a champion for women, makes you a first class asshole.

And your pathetic: ""but I voted for her"", is about as genuine and dishonest as the average trump supporter.
Whether you support trump or bernie, I dont know, but frankly: it's impossible these days to keep those two groups apart.

Being centrist means you start from a position of weakness. When entering negotiations, you don't start with what you expect to accomplish.

Well there's a complex web of phenomena behind this. Men today did not invent the expectation that men should make the first move in dating, or male ""toughness"" & ""boys don't cry"", or the idea that a rejection is somehow an insult. Those things are nasty inheritances that have arisen from the fact that our societies have developed in a patriarchal manner, and these expectations have proven difficult to shed.

Of course Chelsea wouldn't say, for example, ""Well done,"" because that's a British colloquialism, and Chelsea is American.  I'm trying to think of an American equivalent, but we don't really have one, and I feel like that's because, ironically enough, that turn of phrase sounds incredibly condescending to my American ears. 

From what I gathered, the writer has a problem with Chelsea's American syntax, word choice, and construction, and uses that to chastise her for being too aloof.  I think the point the writer was trying to make, if I'm being generous, was that Chelsea is polished (and of course she is, as the writer pointed out, she's always been in the political spotlight), but then she (the writer) called her language clunky, which negates that point.  

I think Chelsea's extremely well-spoken, yes, just like her mother.  But, I'm sick of that being termed as cold, especially from foreign press who, in this case, doesn't seem to understand our speech patterns.

5645,"I think Republicans were always jealous of Bill Clinton. He was the last president that created a tax surplus with a robust economy. If I remember, even after Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton left with a 60% approval rating. Republicans did everything they could to damage them Clintons, and it worked. The Clinton family was never more shady than Republican politicians. Republicans created wars, took corporate money, had private servers under Bush, had their version of Benghazi, and their own mistresses. Newt Gingrich was the most epic example of hipocrisy. He hunted for Bill Clinton's Monica Lewinsky scandal, while turning around and having TWO mistresses. One of those wives had cancer while he was ducking around. Republicans only seen to think Democrats should be punished and called corrupt, but when they do it, It's okay. They lead to the worship of Trump. He can't do anything wrong. So when someone tells you they want ""normal Republicans"" back from Trump, just remember those normal Republicans created the support base that lead to Trump. 

Democrats, however, can't seem to do right in the eyes of the left. Bernie and his progressives are willing to crash the Democrats and make them lose, rather than joining and helping. Problem is the right attacks Dems as taking people's hardworking tax dollars, their guns, and allow the ""murder of babies, and as anti-white. The left of Dems attacks them for not being progressive in the way they please. They want taxes raised, but these Bernie bros keep insisting Trump won because Hillary wasn't progressive enough. That logic doesn't make sense because the majority of Trump voters were lifelong Republicans that want lower taxes and privatizing everything.

And we know she's strong enough to take it and strong enough to weather Republicans hating her and Russia doing everything it can to take her down including trying to craft a narrative that everyone hates her, despite the fact she won more votes than Donald Trump and the second-most votes in U.S. history.

What people aren't realising is that Russia and the GOP hate machine won't go away if Hillary doesn't run again. They are priming for anyone who wins the Dem nomination. Biden, Harris, Duckworth, Booker, Sanders, whomever, once they're the Dem nominee they will be just as hated and just as maligned online by an army of bots making it seem real and cool to hate them and the GOP will make them the devil incarnate like they did Hillary.

This GOP hate machine didn't even start with Clinton. It started with Obama, they made him the devil incarnate for the conservative base.

243,"Just got done going through Bernie's ""AMA"" and I'm wondering why he chose to do this a week before the mid terms especially when he only answers softball questions which allowed him to basically set up a platform for himself instead of actually highlighting candidates up for election next week.

And not to mention the shameless plug for his own book - i I think most people would rather actually see the work he claims he's done to oppose Trump's agenda instead of reading it in a book.. Even more disingenuous when he's spewing his tired spiel about a government benefiting the wealthy while shamelessly trying to profit off his position and influence.

He's basically spent the last two years bashing Democrats and now it seems like he's trying to capitalize off the blue wave momentum.

Seriously though, what was the point of that AMA? He talks a lot of anti-Trump stuff but not one mention of progressive candidates we should be voting for. At this point he's nothing more than a copy and paste politician.

Just because we’re talking about my personal chamber. Most of them are excellently sourced. Sorry local paper, but you’re only ok. 
Next, the extent of human’s role in the environment is only unknown in the way that we don’t know how much more of a negative impact we will have on it. We have scientists for a reason. Experts in the field. I’m not a climate scientist myself, but I do work in a neurobiology lab and I can tell you that people who study stuff for a living know more than you do.  But that’s not the point. The point is that Americans believe that our government should do more to prevent climate change. [here’s the pew poll](http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/14/majorities-see-government-efforts-to-protect-the-environment-as-insufficient/)  
Gun control is overwhelmingly supported by everyone. Far and wide, both parties, people think we should have stricter gun laws. [here’s a Gallup poll with lots of info. ](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx)  70 percent of people think that all guns should be put in a registry. What? I didn’t even know that was on the table. 
Next gay marriage. 1) shut up. That’s not true. Republicans have been attacking gay marriage for a long time now. Mike pence is still supporting organizations that attack gay people. But he’s always been an idiot. [here’s a buzzfeed article showing Pence’s stupidity through his campaign site back in the early oughts ](https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/smoking-doesnt-kill-and-other-great-old-op-eds-from-mike-pen?utm_term=.ryKM66Qv#.kvZjoo4D) 
2) the place you moved the goal post to is also ridiculous and is more than a little obviously based in discrimination.

I know if seems impossible to consider at this moment in time, but assuming that particular groups of people will vote the same way and at the same rates for all time is a mistake. There needs to be constant work to talk to as many people as possible. 

I was also surprised at the level of contradiction, or declaration of intent about gerrymandering in California. There is a good argument that California is too big and it's constituents would be better served if was broken apart. Then David mentioned that his redrawing of the map would include 7 states that would have all voted for Clinton by a good margin. That is pretty hard to do when California had about 200,000 less votes for Trump than Texas. To speak that another way, California has nearly as may Trump voters as the entire state of Texas.

This brings their voice to the table. I don't agree with everything and on some points I probably actually lean conservative. Take paid family leave for instance. I've had 2 kids and certainly that would have been more than helpful to get us through those early days.

If Trump got 20 votes and Clinton got 5 in a huge precinct, that's a lot of dark red splashed across the map.  And given that the electoral college is based on vote totals for the entire state (with slight exceptions in NE and ME), it doesn't actually matter how many precincts each candidate won.

I wish this were set up like the [population dot map](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/) so that all those huge areas in the midwest and west where no one lives would LOOK like no one lives there.

The article demonstrates how the Douma chemical attacks were a fraud/false flag event perpetrated by the ""White Helmets"". It's now an accepted fact the ""attacks"" were a hoax. At the time western media were quick to denounce Assad's ""horrific attack on his own people"" in spite of all common sense dictating otherwise. The result of this knee jerk reaction resulted in *illegal* missile strikes on Syria by the USA. The media cheered on this farce. Now that the gas attack has been proven a farce, western media is silent. The same holds true with the Skripal affair. The media cheered on government sanctions against Russia without a shred of proof, which enabled the state to undermine years of detente.

Incidentally, if you compare the Dems of today to the Cons in Reagan's time you would see that you have been turned so far to the right, Reagan would be happy to have you as constituents. Let that soak in.

This is why the electorate is disgusted with the Clinton clan and the so-called centrists.

Being centrist means capitulation is the order of the day. Don't you think it's time to start pulling back to the left just a little bit?

Being centrist means you start from a position of weakness. When entering negotiations, you don't start with what you expect to accomplish.

4291,">THAT SAID: If you want to know what turned Bernie voters away, it's this, RIGHT HERE, that you're doing RIGHT NOW.  Do not dismiss our candidate as same policies, different name.  There were clear differences in how the two approached several issues important to progressives, and in how long the candidates had held certain progressive positions.  You don't have to agree with them \(or even just their timing\), but if you continue to dismiss the different voices in the party like this, the democratic party will continue to weaken and we will lose more elections to morons that we should have trounced.

THAT SAID: So you're blaming Bernie voters turning to Trump because they didn't like how their candidate was treated or acknowledged? REALLY?! That's fucking precious.  You're actually saying that Bernie voters voted for Trump over Hillary because they didn't feel catered to even though Hillary and the party changed the platform to accommodate Bernie?  And because of ""how long"" Bernie held progressives positions? I mean you're full of shit and don't even pretend you voted for Hillary.

Don't talk about dismissing voices when that's the reason Bernie lost and will continue to lose. Bernie cares only for white working class. He's not a democrat. And democrats are winning over Trump candidates because they're going against every thing Bernie preached.

3472,">Thats more than just false. 

How is that ""more than just false""? I'm talking about the actual words he said. Whereas what you're saying here:

>He just says, that being a progressive is more important for him to support other candidates than being black or a women. 

Is completely skewed because his words aren't about being ""progressive"". And even if it was implied in the way you're revising it, it's still a dismissal of identity politics. Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 


>Than stop saying Bernie wants to dismiss identity politics because he says exactly the same that you just said

He's not saying the same thing, You'd like to think he's saying the same thing but he's not. How are you trying to twist this? Why is this so difficult to understand? You've even changed the meaning of what I said.... I supported her because she was a woman AND she supported progressive/liberal values,,, that's a whole package. That's not what Bernie said. Bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative. Maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a Latina woman. do you see the difference here?

>Would have been a lot more time efficient for both of us if you had said that earlier..

Why should I have to say that? You're the one, like Bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing. If you can't figure out that this is part of other people's views then y'all are the ones with the identity politics problem here.

>Do you have a quote?

I mean Bernie called her unqualified and his campaign manager branded her ""ambitious"" because she wanted to run for president. He dismissed PP as establishment. He dismissed Trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction. And then there's his hardcore supporters coming after Hillary supporters as vagina voters.

And then you go back further... when he ran against a female governor of Vermont he made it about her gender and how it would be sexist to vote for her because she was a woman. I mean, flip that argument... did anyone say it would be sexist to vote for Bernie because he was a man? No. But he's the one who brought it up. He's the one who reduced it to identity of gender. Go look it up.

I can't see a problem there.. as I said, of course we should support a minority/poc or women over majorities/white men - but their policies even above that.


> You guys need to stop conflating gender in this way and behaving like support for a woman or a minority is just down to the identity.

Than stop saying Bernie wants to dismiss identity politics because he says exactly the same that you just said. (""I supported Hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. I didn't support Palin cause she was a woman."") That means, that you supported Clinton because of her ideas and not because of her being a women and you didn't support right-wing women because of their politics.

5487,"I am becoming a bit concerned with the Democratic Congressional Camapagin Committee and it's consistent mistakes. The same time we know this election is a fundamental matter of life and death.

 We are facing the crisis that we do because Republicans  have been highly disciplined and organized. The Democratic cause in this moment requires us to do the same. We need to be long-term, strategic, well-financed and well-aligned. We also must act at the local, state and national levels simultaneously and in sync, resolute in each forum in which power is contested: redistricting, legislative action, electoral work, leadership development. We have finally seen that for too long up close what happens when that power is uncontested. Most especially here in Texas where it’s considerable damage to our State has lay bear. 

Right-wing control in a majority of states most especially Texas has been exploited to draw congressional and state legislative district lines that perpetuate minority voting power to lock in a distorted majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and shut democrats out of meaningful presence in state houses. Yet at this pivotal moment in time the Democratic Party seems to have a awkward and disjointed game plan on recruited candidates and Electoral strategy. With the myriad of polling recently showing the liar and chief strengthening and democratic candidates generic ballot shrinking something is not aligned correctly.

The Democrats cannot reclaim power or leadership until we can give voice to the widespread economic insecurities felt throughout America and deliver!! Lies  drew some voters, to a con artist lying bastard like Trump. HOWEVER they were effective in the first place because democrats failed to connect, but when the lies and bs implode like we have seen voters will not just vote for dems,  (again recent polling) unless they believe we can deliver and I'm afraid we are potentially screwing ourselves out of yet another election that is ours to win.

And to top it all, when he puts economic issues above social and civil rights issues, it's even more alienating to non-white voters. 

Living wage is definitely important but if you're a minority, you're more concerned about getting the job or having the same opportunity for the job as everyone else. Bernie's economics don't factor those issues. 

And if he cared so much about economic equality, then why hasn't he advocated more against voter suppression?

3077,"I would never argue she made no mistakes.

In fact, I can list a few more.:P

Now the question is: can you admit Bernie made a huge mistake too?

The key moment in 2016 was imo the morning after Bernie lost the CA primary.

You may remember that rather dramatic moment. The whole press and every politically interested man/ woman was waiting for him to admit defeat, endorse Hillary and go to work.
Not with a huge chip on his shoulder but enthusiastically.

He didnt.
Instead he spoke about how he'd still win, and launched a huge attack on both Hillary and the DNC.

He continued that for 5 full weeks afterwards.
Those 5 weeks are key. They gave us a time period in which Bernie and trump double teamed in their attacks on Hillary.

He created an illusion among his followers he could still win the primaries (which he couldn’t) making their disappointment bigger and bigger.

And then we saw the melodrama at the convention where Bernie’s supporters (not all but a lot) behaved like complete and total scum.
Booing John Lewis? Booing the mothers of the movement?
Booing any POC they could?

Sitting there with their mouths taped and playing the spoiled disgusting drama queens they were?

The months afterwards, I made the silly decision to start working for Our Revolution as a kind of peace offering. I worked on the campaigns of Jayapal and Teachout.
Not a single fucking Berner wanted to work on those campaigns, instead they obsessed over wikileaks and their immature hatred of the woman that won and the dem party.

On the day before the election I wrote a deeply felt passionate plea to the Bernie subs here on reddit begging them to vote for Hillary.
If not for themselves, for minorities, for women, children, Muslims, poc, lgtb.
I warned them how much trump would hurt us.

I was laughed at, yelled at, scorned and ridiculed by the entitled, privileged scumbags who call themselves Bernieorbusters.

And now, we see everything happen that Hillary and we warned for.
Women, poc, lgtb, children are hurting. 
And you or any other Bernie supporter who voted for Hillary are ok, but do not question that :yes Bernie did enormous damage to Hillary's campaign.

He should have campaigned for her from the CA primary on. Should not have taken a leave to write his damn book and most of all: he should have addressed his spoiled privileged supporters not once but over and over again to talk some sense into them about wikileaks, Russian meddling (bots promoting Bernie) and so on and on.

And Jane Sanders should go to hell for her tweet when Bernie endorsed Hillary and told his supporters to vote for her, they shouldn’t always follow/ do what Bernie told them to….

How is that ""more than just false""? I'm talking about the actual words he said. Whereas what you're saying here:

>He just says, that being a progressive is more important for him to support other candidates than being black or a women. 

Is completely skewed because his words aren't about being ""progressive"". And even if it was implied in the way you're revising it, it's still a dismissal of identity politics. Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 


>Than stop saying Bernie wants to dismiss identity politics because he says exactly the same that you just said

He's not saying the same thing, You'd like to think he's saying the same thing but he's not. How are you trying to twist this? Why is this so difficult to understand? You've even changed the meaning of what I said.... I supported her because she was a woman AND she supported progressive/liberal values,,, that's a whole package. That's not what Bernie said. Bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative. Maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a Latina woman. do you see the difference here?

>Would have been a lot more time efficient for both of us if you had said that earlier..

Why should I have to say that? You're the one, like Bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing. If you can't figure out that this is part of other people's views then y'all are the ones with the identity politics problem here.

>Do you have a quote?

I mean Bernie called her unqualified and his campaign manager branded her ""ambitious"" because she wanted to run for president. He dismissed PP as establishment. He dismissed Trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction. And then there's his hardcore supporters coming after Hillary supporters as vagina voters.

And then you go back further... when he ran against a female governor of Vermont he made it about her gender and how it would be sexist to vote for her because she was a woman. I mean, flip that argument... did anyone say it would be sexist to vote for Bernie because he was a man? No. But he's the one who brought it up. He's the one who reduced it to identity of gender. Go look it up.

The recent election, as in the presidential one? As in the election where the Democrats went out of their way to accommodate Bernie's ""policies"" in to their platform and lost? If anything that move probably hurt the Democrats. 

 > Again, the party has lost it's way. And equal rights alone doesn't absolve a parties overwhelming transgressions... 

And here is the twisting of the narrative where y'all imply it's ""only"" about equal rights and use identity politics as a negative. And what are these transgressions? That's a pretty vague statement especially when you're saying that civil rights are secondary to the functionality of a political party. That's something.

> And that's not just my opinion, but it's the opinion of many many many voters. 

No one is disputing that's your opinion. But it's not the opinion of the majority of democrats. If that was the case and the majority of dems felt  the party had lost its way then Bernie would have won the primaries or at the least it would have been a close race but neither happened.

>A lot of long time Democratic voters switched and either voted for trump or a third party candidate and that should speak volumes to you.

Well this is yet another misrepresentation from you. Come on, if you're trying to make a point, be honest instead of making up things and trying to pass them off as facts just because you want to believe it.

>You have to learn to stop taking democratic criticisms against the party as personal attacks and look towards how you can make the party better and inclusive to everyone..

 Where exactly did I take anything as a ""personal attack""? This is exactly why Bernie Bros are so hated - as soon as someone calls out all the lies and misrepresentations y'all throw out, you hit back with condescension like this. It's a pretty low form of discourse.

It's pretty rich to lecture me and other democrats about making the party more inclusive when people like you are actively dismissing equal rights as a secondary issue. Yeah, let's be ""inclusive"" by focusing on one demographic. Tell me how you're being ""inclusive"" by dismissing equal rights and all the economic and humanitarian repercussions?

of course I'm going to post another rant. Do you really expect to lie and misrepresent and get away with it?

**Israeli Intelligence Firm’s Election-Meddling Analysis Comes Under Mueller’s Scrutiny**

*Psy-Group presentation outlines ways Trump campaign was helped by fake social media accounts*

By Byron Tau and  Rebecca Ballhaus

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators have obtained a presentation prepared by an Israel-based private intelligence firm that outlines ways in which Donald Trump’s 2016 election was helped by fake news and fake social-media accounts, according to people familiar with the presentation and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Mueller’s interest in the presentation suggests his investigation is focusing on the role of social-media manipulation during the 2016 campaign. Intelligence officials have said that cyber-influence campaigns, sometimes covertly sponsored by foreign governments, are expected to become a major part of political campaigning in the coming years.

The presentation consists of nine slides and was prepared by the Psy-Group, a firm that boasts of ties to elite Israeli intelligence agencies. It isn’t clear who received the Psy-Group presentation, but it appears to have been created sometime after the 2016 election.

People familiar with the presentation describe it as an internal analysis drawn up by the firm to drum up U.S. political business—saying that it was essentially used as marketing material for the firm’s operation and analytical capabilities. It also represents a “proof of concept” of how a firm like Psy-Group would have manipulated the 2016 campaign as well as future campaigns, people said.

It is unclear how much of the presentation consists of the firm’s analysis of online activity during the campaign and how much is a hypothetical pitch.

Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Mr. Zamel, said the presentation copy that Mr. Mueller has obtained was a “sample type analysis of what they could do.”

A spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment.

The presentation outlines the ways in which social media “bots” and fake online content were used to help energize voters supportive of Mr. Trump. One slide entitled “Trump Campaign Components” outlines a timeline where “fake news sites/avatars/content” were created during the early part of the election year and then leveraged to spread “uncertainty” by midyear. The final stage was “using fake bots to react to real life situations & further polarize the TA,” or target audience, the slide says.

Another slide says the firm identified 140 pro-Trump websites linked to a man in Macedonia. The websites “had American-sounding domain names such as WorldPoliticus.com” and “published aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the USA.” WorldPoliticus.com is no longer active.

A person familiar with Trump campaign’s operations said it has “absolutely no knowledge of what this firm was referring to” in the slideshow.

Another slide outlines a Facebook strategy where fake online profiles or “avatars” engage real people online and encourage them to share content. The result is a “multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies,” the slide says.

In September, Facebook disclosed that it identified about 500 “inauthentic” accounts with ties to Russia that bought $100,000 worth of ads during a two-year period encompassing the presidential campaign.

Mr. Mueller is investigating whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded in Russian efforts to interfere in the election. Moscow has denied meddling and Mr. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign.

The Psy-Group’s founder, Joel Zamel, is under scrutiny from U.S. investigators because of his close relationship with the government of the United Arab Emirates and his involvement in a meeting with Mr. Trump’s eldest son shortly before election day, the Journal has reported.

Mr. Zamel met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in the weeks before the 2016 election along with George Nader, a top adviser to the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, to discuss an offer to help boost the campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. Erik Prince, a U.S. defense contractor who specializes in the Middle East and had close ties to the campaign, attended the meeting, the Journal previously reported. People involved in the meeting say nothing came of it and the Psy-Group didn’t perform any work for the Trump campaign.

A lawyer for Mr. Trump Jr. said Messrs. Zamel and Nader had pitched his client on “a social media platform or marketing strategy” and that “he was not interested and that was the end of it.”

The presentation reviewed by the Journal wasn’t related to the Trump Tower meeting nor was it prepared for Mr. Nader, said Mr. Mukasey, Mr. Zamel’s attorney.

Mr. Mueller has been investigating Mr. Zamel’s work and has interviewed Mr. Zamel about his business relationship with Mr. Nader, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Mukaseyhas said investigators have told him his client isn’t a target of the probe. A subpoena concerning Mr. Zamel’s work, but not issued to Mr. Zamel, was reviewed by the Journal.

Mr. Nader has been cooperating with investigators since January, when investigators stopped him at Dulles Airport and served him with a subpoena.

A lawyer for Mr. Nader said his client has “fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation and will continue to do so.” The lawyer declined to answer further questions.

The Psy-Group was formed by Mr. Zamel, the son of an Australian mining magnate who moved to Israel to study counterterrorism. There, Mr. Zamel founded several companies beginning in 2010 and became increasingly close to the government of the U.A.E., the Journal has previously reported. One of his companies, Wikistrat, did war games and analysis for the U.A.E. in 2014 and say he was close to the national security adviser there, according to people familiar with Mr. Zamel.

People familiar with the Psy-Group’s operations say it provided intelligence services for political and corporate clients.

After the 2016 election, the firm started to pitch for business in the U.S., including for the 2018 midterms. As part of its pitch to potential political clients, the Psy-Group said it had the capability of leveraging fake social-media accounts, which they call avatars, on behalf of political campaigns.

“Psy excels at the use of online avatars that appear natural, unbiased and object. These avatars are highly effective at directing political messaging to target audiences,” marketing materials reviewed by the Journal say. These fake social accounts could be used for “narrative warfare” or to “echo campaign messaging,” the firm said.

No political entity has made any payments to the Psy-Group since 2015, according to Federal Election Commission records. The participation of foreign firms or individuals in U.S. elections is tightly controlled.

If Trump got 20 votes and Clinton got 5 in a huge precinct, that's a lot of dark red splashed across the map.  And given that the electoral college is based on vote totals for the entire state (with slight exceptions in NE and ME), it doesn't actually matter how many precincts each candidate won.

I wish this were set up like the [population dot map](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/) so that all those huge areas in the midwest and west where no one lives would LOOK like no one lives there.  I also don't get why Maine has large blank white spaces where there are no voters and therefore no precincts, but other similarly rural states have similarly unpopulated areas colored in.",flyingmountain,e32t76y,hillaryclinton

I don't think she can be impartial when it comes to considering sensible legislation. If it a law even happens to benefit a bank or insurance company in anyway she will be obliged to blast it. And who knows where she will land on the US military. I can't envision her ever giving a tough military order. At least Trump knows to basically stay out of it. He talks and talks, but no one at Pentagon is listening. That's scary for all sorts of other reasons, but a more attached president would have had a major showdown with military brass by now.

It's true that Trump isn't fit for office for a lot of reasons, but you should probably also run policy based ads too so people know what you're gonna do as president.

Her criticisms of Cuomo are stuffed with triggers like “ultra rich donors,” her platform reads like a Xerox of Sanders’ 2016 positions, and just in case you still were wondering about her revolutionary creds, she has sprinkled the p-word generously throughout her tweets, making sure that despite her earlier support of Hillary and her own wealth and fame, she doesn’t give off the deadly whiff of **“establishment”** BO.

**Israeli Intelligence Firm’s Election-Meddling Analysis Comes Under Mueller’s Scrutiny**

*Psy-Group presentation outlines ways Trump campaign was helped by fake social media accounts*

By Byron Tau and  Rebecca Ballhaus

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators have obtained a presentation prepared by an Israel-based private intelligence firm that outlines ways in which Donald Trump’s 2016 election was helped by fake news and fake social-media accounts, according to people familiar with the presentation and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Mueller’s interest in the presentation suggests his investigation is focusing on the role of social-media manipulation during the 2016 campaign. Intelligence officials have said that cyber-influence campaigns, sometimes covertly sponsored by foreign governments, are expected to become a major part of political campaigning in the coming years.

The presentation consists of nine slides and was prepared by the Psy-Group, a firm that boasts of ties to elite Israeli intelligence agencies. It isn’t clear who received the Psy-Group presentation, but it appears to have been created sometime after the 2016 election.

People familiar with the presentation describe it as an internal analysis drawn up by the firm to drum up U.S. political business—saying that it was essentially used as marketing material for the firm’s operation and analytical capabilities. It also represents a “proof of concept” of how a firm like Psy-Group would have manipulated the 2016 campaign as well as future campaigns, people said.

It is unclear how much of the presentation consists of the firm’s analysis of online activity during the campaign and how much is a hypothetical pitch.

Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Mr. Zamel, said the presentation copy that Mr. Mueller has obtained was a “sample type analysis of what they could do.”

A spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment.

The presentation outlines the ways in which social media “bots” and fake online content were used to help energize voters supportive of Mr. Trump. One slide entitled “Trump Campaign Components” outlines a timeline where “fake news sites/avatars/content” were created during the early part of the election year and then leveraged to spread “uncertainty” by midyear. The final stage was “using fake bots to react to real life situations & further polarize the TA,” or target audience, the slide says.

Another slide says the firm identified 140 pro-Trump websites linked to a man in Macedonia. The websites “had American-sounding domain names such as WorldPoliticus.com” and “published aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the USA.” WorldPoliticus.com is no longer active.

A person familiar with Trump campaign’s operations said it has “absolutely no knowledge of what this firm was referring to” in the slideshow.

Another slide outlines a Facebook strategy where fake online profiles or “avatars” engage real people online and encourage them to share content. The result is a “multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies,” the slide says.

In September, Facebook disclosed that it identified about 500 “inauthentic” accounts with ties to Russia that bought $100,000 worth of ads during a two-year period encompassing the presidential campaign.

Mr. Mueller is investigating whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded in Russian efforts to interfere in the election. Moscow has denied meddling and Mr. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign.

The Psy-Group’s founder, Joel Zamel, is under scrutiny from U.S. investigators because of his close relationship with the government of the United Arab Emirates and his involvement in a meeting with Mr. Trump’s eldest son shortly before election day, the Journal has reported.

Mr. Zamel met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in the weeks before the 2016 election along with George Nader, a top adviser to the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, to discuss an offer to help boost the campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. Erik Prince, a U.S. defense contractor who specializes in the Middle East and had close ties to the campaign, attended the meeting, the Journal previously reported. People involved in the meeting say nothing came of it and the Psy-Group didn’t perform any work for the Trump campaign.

A lawyer for Mr. Trump Jr. said Messrs. Zamel and Nader had pitched his client on “a social media platform or marketing strategy” and that “he was not interested and that was the end of it.”

The presentation reviewed by the Journal wasn’t related to the Trump Tower meeting nor was it prepared for Mr. Nader, said Mr. Mukasey, Mr. Zamel’s attorney.

Mr. Mueller has been investigating Mr. Zamel’s work and has interviewed Mr. Zamel about his business relationship with Mr. Nader, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Mukaseyhas said investigators have told him his client isn’t a target of the probe. A subpoena concerning Mr. Zamel’s work, but not issued to Mr. Zamel, was reviewed by the Journal.

Mr. Nader has been cooperating with investigators since January, when investigators stopped him at Dulles Airport and served him with a subpoena.

A lawyer for Mr. Nader said his client has “fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation and will continue to do so.” The lawyer declined to answer further questions.

The Psy-Group was formed by Mr. Zamel, the son of an Australian mining magnate who moved to Israel to study counterterrorism. There, Mr. Zamel founded several companies beginning in 2010 and became increasingly close to the government of the U.A.E., the Journal has previously reported. One of his companies, Wikistrat, did war games and analysis for the U.A.E. in 2014 and say he was close to the national security adviser there, according to people familiar with Mr. Zamel.

People familiar with the Psy-Group’s operations say it provided intelligence services for political and corporate clients.

After the 2016 election, the firm started to pitch for business in the U.S., including for the 2018 midterms. As part of its pitch to potential political clients, the Psy-Group said it had the capability of leveraging fake social-media accounts, which they call avatars, on behalf of political campaigns.

“Psy excels at the use of online avatars that appear natural, unbiased and object. These avatars are highly effective at directing political messaging to target audiences,” marketing materials reviewed by the Journal say. These fake social accounts could be used for “narrative warfare” or to “echo campaign messaging,” the firm said.

No political entity has made any payments to the Psy-Group since 2015, according to Federal Election Commission records. The participation of foreign firms or individuals in U.S. elections is tightly controlled.

It's pure prejudice and propaganda.

What we learned from the Obama candidacy is that some of the older prejudices and propaganda about the president needing to be seen as a ""safe"" person have been eroded enough (due to numerous sex scandals) which made it okay for a black man to be voted in despite being seen as inherently threatening to white womanhood.

It was a rookie mistake. It cost us the game. The damage will be severe, and long-lived.

Protecting Trump is the only thing that matters anymore.  Let's say any evidence comes out Trump was supported by the Russian State directly.  It would implicate and destroy the entire Republican party.  In order to preserve their power, they must destroy the country first.

Thats more than just false. He just says, that being a progressive is more important for him to support other candidates than being black or a women. He just puts the ideas of a candidate first. I can't see a problem there.. as I said, of course we should support a minority/poc or women over majorities/white men - but their policies even above that.


> You guys need to stop conflating gender in this way and behaving like support for a woman or a minority is just down to the identity.

Than stop saying Bernie wants to dismiss identity politics because he says exactly the same that you just said. (""I supported Hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. I didn't support Palin cause she was a woman."") That means, that you supported Clinton because of her ideas and not because of her being a women and you didn't support right-wing women because of their politics. Thats exactly what Bernie says (""Being a latina is not enough"") but it still matters because ""We need 50 women in the senate. We need more African Americans."".

Kavanaugh decided that to have any chance to reach the court, he would have to shed the pretense he was a fair-minded, calm, judicious thinker. **He came out in the afternoon filled with venom, screaming at the committee. His life was being ruined, he claimed. This was a Clinton-like smear.** His anger was both **frightening and unexpected** — if you thought he was that intellectual whom conservatives have swooned over. He yelled, and he cried. If you thought he was sincere, one could also appreciate how **partisan and emotional** he had become.

>The refusal to get the facts is both a telling admission of concern about what they would find and a violation the judicial goal of truth-seeking. It’s **a political calculation, exactly what you don’t want to see from a judge**.

~

>The worst moment was his confrontation with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) who questioned him about blackout drinking. She explained that she understood alcohol abuse because her father was an alcoholic. Have you ever blacked out? she asked. He sneered in response, “Have you?” It was **a moment of singular cruelty and disrespect**. One saw a flash in the exchange with Klobuchar the same **sense of entitlement, cruelty and lack of simple decency** that Christine Blasey Ford allegedly experienced way back when, the memory seared in her brain of two obnoxious teens laughing at her ordeal.

~

>Kavanaugh says he was not the attacker. But even if you believe that — despite Ford’s riveting testimony — one can reasonably conclude he is not the right person to sit on the court. **His anger toward liberals is palpable, his lack of humility bracing. He has the partisan mindset that opponents are unworthy of respect and kindness.**

>... his heart is that of a **conservative partisan**, one who tried so very hard to make himself into Supreme Court material. The **mentality of a political operative** — willing to go on Fox News, **ready to inflame passions, disrespectful toward opponents** — is still there. A nonpartisan would ask for, if not demand, an FBI investigation and Judge’s appearance. Kavanaugh wants to avoid both at all costs.

3467,"Yes I'm not denying he said any of those things. But those words are not him supporting identity politics... in fact, he uses them as a basis for dismissing identity politics. I mean, he claims he wants to see more Latinos and African Americans in government but then he immediately dismisses their identity as a factor when in fact he should consider that their identity plays a big role in their politics. 

He assumes that this lady, just because she identifies as Latino and is a woman, doesn't care about economic issues. That's his fallacy there - he can't see that someone who is a woman and a minority can also address economic issues.

>And even though you dont like Bernie, he is more in favour of women rights, than Sarah Palin would have been as Vice-President... so clearly I have to agree: Being black, a latina/-o or a women is not enough.

Why are you bringing up Sarah Palin like she's someone I'm using as a litmus test? Again, this is the problem with Bernie and his die-hards - he uses identity as a litmus test. I supported Hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. I didn't support Palin cause she was a woman. I don't admire Condoleeza cause she was a woman. You guys need to stop conflating gender in this way and behaving like support for a woman or a minority is just down to the identity.

And my problem with Bernie is exavctly this - he rails against identity politics yet he's the one who reduces his opponents to their identities. He did with Hillary and he's done it with other candidates he's run against in the past. And he's actively dismissed issues that concern women and minorities at the same time. 

So again, no one is saying that someone should be elected just because they're a woman or black or latino. Only Bernie is saying that.

Which is complete bullshit. I watched the discussion and this is a such a misrepresentation of it. And of course they don't even bother to cover the rest of the conversation that was so much more than this - it was such a nuanced and in depth conversation but of course all of that is ignored.

You're proof of that.

Bernie will run in 2020 because of his massive ego, and it's an easy way to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars from poor people to him and his cronies. I mean, Hillary broke her arm several weeks ago when she accidentally stepped between Bernie and a microphone. 

So, let's assume he is. He will probably win Iowa because white people and caucuses. He will win NH because he's from a neighboring state. Then what happens in Nevada? That will be interesting, and where Bernie supporters lost their minds in 2016. Who comes out of the first 3 to challenge Bernie? 

Then SuperTuesday and the Southern primaries. This is when Bernie got crushed, and was basically mathematically eliminated. Of course, he didn't want to do the honorable thing, and concede. No, he wanted to stay in, so he could milk as much money out of you suckers for as long as possible. It worked! Bernie won 4 out of 13 states, with 2 being caucuses (of course) and 1 his home state. But now we have included California! 

So, does Harris run, and win California and most of the Southern states? That could be a big blow to Saint Bernard. Once again, getting crushed by Dems most reliable voting block - black women. If she doesn't run, does Cali give Bernie a huge boost? Could happen.

Does Bernie win enough delegates early because of the other Dems splitting the votes, so he can win - just like Trump? 

Does the Dems concede early, so that doesn't happen? 

Does someone come out of nowhere to take it like often happens?

Do Dems challenge Bernie, and does he actually get vetted by the media and his opponents? 

Does Biden run to save the Dems from Bernie and Trump?

2452,"My career's in tech infrastructure and security (more infra than security, but I'm not ignorant), so that's where my perspective is focused here.

Would there be direct evidence?  In a well-run setup, possibly. Depends on how good the hackers were.

In almost any of these setups?  Fuck no.  

All the circumstantial evidence others are complaining about is *probably* the best the public's gonna get.  I can't speak to legal status, but in the tech world, the evidence Michael Harriot laid out in this piece is more than enough to answer the kinds of questions we tend to have.  Those questions boil down to essentially one:

Given the available metadata (logs, audit trails, system monitoring histograms, diffs between backups and live data, etc), *can we trust that this system wasn't tampered with*?

That question itself is generally made up of two smaller ones:  What *do* we know? and What *can* we know?  I almost started basically typing out the article in my own words, but I'll skip that part.  Between how badly-secured these systems were (both design and implementation, and all the way from end-user to database backends), how badly audited and logged they were, and how badly backups were kept (if any), I think most competent professionals would generally agree on these points:

* We know attackers gained access to live voting systems/databases

* We know end-user voting machines are embarrassingly easy to gain access to.

* Due to bad security practices of many kinds, and in at least one case deliberate deletion of backups, *it is not possible* to verify whether or not data was changed in many of these cases.

In the computer security world, if you can't verify something, being thorough means you must assume the worst-case scenario.  How you deal with it depends a lot on context but to stay focused: This means that we as technical professionals *must* assume rolls and votes were tampered with.

The malfeasance and incompetence continually demonstrated over the course of the last two decades or so of modern electronic voting in the US has the general public in a position where anyone with a strong enough political lean can accept or dismiss the available data as they wish.  The pattern-matcher in me wants to think that's on purpose but that's neither here nor there.

As an industry expert, the 'case' presented in this article is highly convincing.  ""Can we trust that these systems were not tampered with?""  No, full stop.  Will we ever have *direct* evidence that votes were changed? Given the mismanagement involved, I very strongly doubt that.  Is that enough for a legal case? I have no idea. If I were brought in to fix the situation? This is more than enough.",tuba_man,e3537y7,hillaryclinton

It hurts, I swear; on one end, you consistently see decorum, statesmanship, intelligence, and empathy with Hillary Clinton--even to this day! Knowledgeable, aware, still passionate about the United States, And then on the other end, absurd headlines of consistent corruption, ineptitude, at such a constant pace it pains me. The F****king hypocritical GOP gets on my damn nerves. The woefully ignorant and those who didn't vote make me sick every damn day! And these people see nothing wrong in Donald Drumpf.

There have been countless examples of Trump v any other political individual and nobody gives a hoot. Mark my word, I long for the day Trump resigns. So help me GOD because this indivudal should not be at 1600 Penn. Everything he does is out of spite and ego, with ignorance magnified tenfold. He speaks gibbrish, communicates in lies, lies lies and lies. All of these people LIE!  AND the F####king Ryan and McConnel say 'oh well' our voters are too stupid.

Never again, never again shall there be another Trump. The stakes were very clear and present, and throughly explained leading up to the election, and significant parts of Wisconsoin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio (I think) all said Let's try this guy. ""LETS TRY THIS GUY"". A know-nothing, endemic narcissist, corrupt, lying, sexual harasser, self-aggrandizing, pompous, caustic, rude, man! Whose whole character SCREAMED not PRESIDENTIAL.

Yet people have the nerve to complain today ""Oh my God, he tore up the IRAN deal"" This man said during the debates that he had no qualms bombing families and the causalties that came with that! Is America so F****ing Stupid! ( I Know the answer is no.... Just 3 states... I get it) But still, EVERY single DAMN DAY--corruption and ineptitude flows from the head down constantly, consistently--and this party--this dead party of LINCOLN, emulate chagrin and indifference. It's sickening, Absolutely sickening!

I'm 23. I voted in POTUS election--first time because I was finally eligiable, and it goes without saying we know who the competent indivdual would've been. But my GOD--the nerve from some journalists to media outlets that these people had to put TRUMP and Former First Lady, Secretary, Senator, Magna Cum Laude on same playing field! Just a Joke!

And the stain, from History onward will not be kind to America. We need a course correct like yesterday! Vote, encourage others to Vote, Trump and his cohorts cannot continue in this manner of violating norms, and denigrating institutions. It just cannot be. 

Forgive me for the rant, but I just get tired of these nonsense headlines, consistent corruption Pruitt, Conway, Munchin/Manchin, and Trump! He lies, and then acts stupid about it.

3656,"It doesn't matter what group or what label you identify Cortez as... what matters are her issues and that's where you've tried to conveniently cherry-pick issues that you think align her with Sanders and against Clinton... but you clearly are quite misinformed about Clinton's platform and issues or you're intentionally trying to mislead just like you did with your comment about Bernie's take on identity politics.

>She supports single-payer health care, tuition-free college, ending private prisons, and clean campaign financing. These are some of her main policy positions, none of which Hillary Clinton supported and all of which Bernie supported.

Hillary wasn't against single payer healthcare. She was just against Bernie's plan. Her plan built towards it.

She supported tuition-free college, ending private prisons and definitely for campaign finance reform.  

And by the way, one of Cortez's big issues is criminal justice reform which was also Hillary's. Not Bernie's. And also paid family leave. Again, another main issue on Hillary's platform. Not Bernie's.

It's really amazing that you have no clue about someone you're attacking in this way. Doesn't matter if you're a Marxist or whatever... at least you should know what you're talking about instead of outright lying. Unless you yourself don't know these facts and if that's  the case then please educate yourself.

>Do you remember the Bankruptcy Bill? Hillary flipped on that hardcore. There's her record on banks in a nutshell.

Again, I'm going to ask about how much you know about this apart from the surface level knowledge you're exhibiting.  If you wanna talk about the bankruptcy bill as an example of her track record then why don't you discuss the intricacies of her vote:

https://medium.com/@zacharyleven/the-case-for-hillary-3564233d524f

Have a read. It might be informative especially if you think that's her record on banks in a nutshell. You clearly have a lot of information gaps.

So again, it doesn't matter whether Cortez is DSC or you're a marxist... it matters about the issues and about being honest about issues which you are not. At the end of the day, you're hurting yourself with this kind of dishonesty.

1641,">  Do you think a woman like her would have elected senator twice, run for the nomination in2008 when she lost by a 1% (she probably won the popular vote) and then run again and win handily if she didn't have the skills suited for the ""bully pulpit""?

Do you think a person like her would have been elected Senator twice if she didn't have intimate access to a former 2-term POTUS's rolodex, staff, and list of favors to call in -- such as making sure the other primary candidates in the blue state to which she had just moved, withdrew before she entered? And... she won ""handily"" in 2016? Yes I am afraid we are operating from different dimensions.

For the record though, I do assume there would be ""this partisan politics at play,"" not sure why anyone thinks that would have evaporated. I did agree were she elected it would be vastly preferable to what we have now, that's why I voted for her in November and urged my peers to do the same. But with an ability to pursue her own agenda? Don't see how.

The more *left* populists like OSC win, the more people recognize they *can* win and succeed that way, until even the party can't fail to recognize it.

There were clear differences in how the two approached several issues important to progressives, and in how long the candidates had held certain progressive positions.  You don't have to agree with them \(or even just their timing\), but if you continue to dismiss the different voices in the party like this, the democratic party will continue to weaken and we will lose more elections to morons that we should have trounced.

THAT SAID: So you're blaming Bernie voters turning to Trump because they didn't like how their candidate was treated or acknowledged? REALLY?! That's fucking precious.  You're actually saying that Bernie voters voted for Trump over Hillary because they didn't feel catered to even though Hillary and the party changed the platform to accommodate Bernie?  And because of ""how long"" Bernie held progressives positions? I mean you're full of shit and don't even pretend you voted for Hillary.

Don't talk about dismissing voices when that's the reason Bernie lost and will continue to lose. Bernie cares only for white working class. He's not a democrat. And democrats are winning over Trump candidates because they're going against every thing Bernie preached.

He specifically said about Russia that they didn't ""know they had anything"" at that point but at the same time he didn't know he ""had anything"" with the emails they found on Weiner's laptop (and eventually there was nothing) yet he felt the need to disclose THAT investigation and not the other.

You can't be ""progressive"" and condone what Assad has been doing. Supporting ""non-intervention"" is not a good enough excuse to support politicians who are being paid by Putin and Assad.

Gabbard is one of the worst.  She is proof of the horseshoe theory.  Her entire persona is built around being anti-Obama and pro-Assad. But isn't it funny how she hasn't said about Trump.

In a way i see it as a kind of response to a generational issue about women's rights and civil liberties that came up during the primaries but was largely ignored after - the importance of recognizing struggles of the activists who have allowed us to have so many of our modern civil liberties.

No need for the question mark, none of those sources are right of center. I will say that FiveThirtyEight and Politifact are much closer than WaPo. They also have much better track records for accuracy, but that doesn't mean what they cover and how they cover it is irrelevant. They do slant; all news orgs do. You just don't read anything except ones that are left leaning. Also, you began your complaining in the Hillary Clinton sub, so echo-chamber is probably dead on. What opposition did you expect to find? Who were you trying to convince?

Climate Change- We both can cite numerous academics that agree with our positions, but there is still plenty of debate going on about the extent of our effect on the planet. [HERE] (https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/climate-change-no-its-not-97-percent-consensus-ian-tuttle/) is a right leaning website that explains a few skepticisms about how ""certain"" scientists are.

Furthermore, your original complaint expressed your discontent with Republicans not voting to support the widely accepted views of climate change. However, the Pew Poll you referenced answered your own question it the numbers when it said, ""74% of Republicans and Independents who lean Republican believe it is possible to cut regulations and protect the quality of air and water..."" I think sometimes Reps get painted as not caring about the environment, which isn't true (according to this study). They just have a lot of confidence that there is another way to take care of the issue than target certain industries and jobs (coal specifically). 

Gun Control- The Gallup Poll you referenced was also comical. You are 100% right that the survey participants support stricter gun laws. Where it gets funny is where they suggest what regulations would work and which ones wouldn't. All the suggested prevention methods that are widely considered effective are laws we ALREADY have on the books. The 3 at the bottom where a true divide starts to take place are laws that have been proposed by Dems but never approved on a federal level. It would be logical to conclude that the Gallup Poll, taken only a month after the Parkland shooting, might be emotionally driven. If everybody says more needs to be done, but then they only promote laws that already exists, it could just be honest-to-goodness frustration and sadness. Not to mention the fact that only 42% of people reported owning a gun. Everybody seems to have an opinion, but only 42% of them actually know what they are talking about. 

As far as the next few topics you brought up, I believe you told me to shut up, typed out childish sounds, and then became self-conscious about the aesthetics of your post. Maybe you can forward that nonsense onto all the people who think like you do in this sub.

There has never been a more important issue in politics as the fact trump has instructed the ICE to separate young children (babies literally) from their parents and now lost 1450 of them.

Mothers and parents are separated from babies of only a few months old and they will likely never again see their child.

The stories are heartbreaking. A father had his 18 months son ripped from his arms and now that child is missing.

Trump is instructing the ICE to do this.

This isnt nazi Germany 40-45, this is the US 2018.

Parents are forced to wear yellow bracelets (Yellow stars..anyone?) and see their children taken away and the government is not keeping track of where these children are.
trump's government is likely trafficking these children.

Call your representatives in Congress, demonstrate, stand up NOW.

3068,"Her campaign in the general didn't advertise in the Rust Belt until days before she lost to Trump. Her advertising in the general almost totally ignored policy, and the vast majority of her ads almost exclusively focused on ad-hominem attacks and Trumps unfitness for office. Which no other political campaign in advertising history has done to the degree her campaign did.

Trumps campaign, in contrast, stuck to a more traditional advertising strategy of comparing and contrasting policy.

So considering the vast, vast majority of Sanders voters voted for Hillary in the general I think I'm gonna have to point more towards a bad general campaign and a historically weird advertising strategy than anything involving Sanders as a primary cause of her loss.

They should of just stuck with the tried and true method of compare and contrast advertising like she did in the primary against Sanders. But instead they gambled on a novel advertising strategy against Trump, and lost.

He knew Hillary's investigation was going nowhere, but if he didn't say anything, he risked leaks, Hillary being called an illegitimate president, and the FBI being called partisan.

He was essentially concerned about what Fox News would convince the American people of...

Comey is so weird for me. I'm not happy with him. And I totally see that ""I alone can fix this"" mentality that Trump and Sanders have. But at the same time, I can sympathize. The last few years have taught me more than I could have imagined about myself politically. And one of the things that I've learned, is that I actually very much do believe in our governmental system and structure...As, anyone who chooses to get a legal education tends to, but I just hadn't examined that deeply held belief until this administration \(although it really started with Mitch during the Obama administration\) started tearing it down. I find myself going ""He can't legally do that...guys..guys..why is he being allowed to do that.."" And that's Comey. 

To me, Comey tried to protect our system from a major political sub\-culture. He through out a few pages to protect the book \- but ended up burning down the whole library. His sin, IMO, is he fails to see how he contributed to the problem of illegitimacy..that every move he made to counteract the fox news narrative, legitimized what that narrative was saying. I think a lot of this book is him trying to convince us, and himself, that he did the right thing.

3508,">  Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 

No, where do you read that out? It says, that not everyone who is from a minority is automatically progressive. Thats why I gave you some examples, almost no left-leaning liberal would prefer a female/latina/black republican over a male/white/heterosexual (progressive) democrat. 

>  Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 

It might be that he thinks a lot more in terms of class than other politicians do (if they do it at all) because he says he is a socialist. But still he made clear quite a lot that racial and gender justice is really important (to him).

> Bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative.

Come on.. I am pretty sure Bernie knew Hillary Clinton from their time in Senate together.. 

> Maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a Latina woman.

He could have done that. But I don't know the centext.. I have searched for quite a bit but didn't found an article with the full question but I found one with the full (long) answer. Yes, he could simply have asked what she wants to change or whats to do and when she replied he could than have said ""okay, thats great"" or ""yeah, thats not enough"". But what he could also have done is say that it is really important go get enough minoritiy candidates into politics but they also have to be progressives. I don't see a problem there. (Even tough his statement beginns with ""Let me respond to the question in a way you may not be happy with"", so its probably more than ""I want to be the first latina.."" but a real question)

> You're the one, like Bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing.

Where am I beeing very arrogant? And where am I reducing identity politics as a negative thing?

> I mean Bernie called her unqualified and his campaign manager branded her ""ambitious"" because she wanted to run for president.

Bernie replied to her, when she said that Bernie didnt do his homework and that doesnt understand how to break up big banks and voters should ask themselves if he can deliver what he promises. Then Bernie just replied ""Theyre going to question my qualifications, so I am questioning theirs."" And he repeated the same in a debate (""you might wonder about your qaulifications Madame Secretary"". And then he said why he is questioning them: Iraq war, trade agreements, super PACs, Wall Street. Yes, this might be a bit childish (Bernie said that ""we"" shouldnt get into that tit-for-tat) but I dont think its sexist. 

It is basically ""being a women is not enough"" because you have to stand up against big banks and not take their money. And the ""ambitious"" thing is actually another context.. but okay, I am not here to say that every member of the campaign is perfect. But its a bit far-fetched to say that Bernie reduced Clinton to her identity because his campaign manager says, that she has ambitions to be president... thats basically a fact for (nearly) every candidate.

> He dismissed Trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction.

No he said that this is shameful and its probably not against Clinton but this would be against all women. A quote of the interview: ""Maybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing America. Donald Trump will not look quite so interesting in that context."" He is not saying, that abortion rights are not important (which is insane to say if you know his voting record and his engagement for women rights.

> And then there's his hardcore supporters coming after Hillary supporters as vagina voters.

And then there is the hardcore supporters of Hillary coming after Bernie supporters (but again Bernie supporters /=/ Bernie) who say that there is a special place in hell for women who dont support Clinton. Or that young women support Bernie because they want to meet boys. Or all the ""Bernie Bros"" that just support Bernie because he is a man. 

> when he ran against a female governor of Vermont he made it about her gender and how it would be sexist to vote for her because she was a woman

I dont know about the time, that was before I was born. What he said though is that many people are excited because she is a women but there is nothing more (because) he is the bigger feminist. I just dont know if that is true. But yeah, it would be sexist to vote for Bernie if they just do it because he is a men.

They create policy, they lobby legislators for that policy, they run the state government bureaucracy. Things like that. There's a bunch of stuff _that does not actually require government office to have experience in._ Likewise, holding elected office does not automatically grant you that kind of experience. For example, the mayor of New York or a few other cities might have handled running a similar bureaucracy... but legislators would not have that experience. There would be very few non-incumbents with that sort of experience, so it's a little ridiculous to expect it as a prerequisite for the same reason it's silly to expect ten years experience for an entry level job. Nixon has run a multimillion dollar non-profit, though, so she does have executive experience.

I think she has some great ideas and I’m excited to see how she works at executing them throughout her career which is still very early on.

Honestly, for her to even say this right now is in really bad form. We need to begin to turn the tide on this government in the Midterms, and anything that *anyone* on the Left does to rile up the Right is just fucking bad. Whether we get the ""blue tide"" next week or not, we will still need to focus as much attention on Congress in 2020 as on the White House, so we need a candidate in 2020 that the entire Left can get behind.

5738,"Republicans are the corporate party because they take corporate money. A good chunk of the democratic party also take corporate money. The difference is that usually all the Republicans fall in line with the establishment so they can actually push through their gross agenda while the democrats are almost always split on every issue because half of them take so much money from the rich, so whatever gets done is an extremely watered down version of what the left actually wants. 

Obamacare is a great example. What the left wanted was a single payer Healthcare system, but Obama (who was a great president don't get me wrong) didn't like negotiating, so he went right to the compromise which would have been a public option. Republicans used this as an advantage by then making a compromise of the compromise: an individual mandate system which is the old-school republican idea.

War is another great example. When Obama took office, he didn't hold Bush or the republicans accountable for entering a war with a country that didn't attack us. In fact, he expanded it by getting us into 7 interventions (trump got us into an 8th one). 

The most embarrassing one might've been when Obama introduced gun reform and an incredibly watered down background check didn't even pass. 

Republicans have taken the democrats shift to the middle as an opportunity to go extremely right-wing. This happened because democrats thought people would think the democrats would seem so much more reasonable by compromising, but humans are inherently tribalistic and many don't actually care about the policies, they care about their team winning. Donald Trump is a great example, who rallied against war in the primaries and Republicans backed him up (nows he's super pro war and Republicans are still backing him up because this is about ""yea that's my guy, that's my team, go us"" mentality). 

Basically what I'm saying is that if democrats stop taking corporate money, real progressives will win primaries because they aren't facing up against fundraising (by the very wealthy) from the economically center right democrats and there will be more than just a few real progressive voices in Congress. Then I think we can finally work on getting money out of politics. 

I view getting money out of politics as endgame because Republicans are really good at using their massive amount of money to advertise their policies that hurt the middle class to the middle class. (for example the estate tax was turned into the ""death tax"" because people went ""Oh shit, I'm gonna die. I don't want that to happen to me"" when it only affects an incredibly small amount of people and their bratty kids still get loads of money.

Oh and seriously? You think Underwood, Lucy McBath, Sharice Davids, Gina Ortez to just name a few, ran on Sanders-esque platforms?
How can you not see how you A: belittle what they accomplished by attributing what they did to Sanders, B: completely misrepresent their positions. 
Sanders actively ran against Davids, to name just one example. Wanted to push the white out of state guy instead of her, so lets not pretend theyre connected to Sanders, shall we?

No, they had nothing to do with Sanders or his platform. Lucy McBath ran because of her son being murdered and because she wants to fight for gun control (against which bernie voted repeatedly).

Policies matters, sure, but so does skin color. Representation matters.
This isnt the moment to run a 80 year old white guy. That applies to Sanders but also to Biden.
You may see that as bias, but there is no way inm hell I'm gonna end up voting for a 80 year old white guy in the coming primaries, in the time of 'me too' and raging white nationalism.

1817,"""Blame men"" is not ""discussing the fact that women who reject a man sometimes end up murdered and that most murderers are men."" ""Blame men"" is identity politics.

Should we ""blame black people"" because black people on average have a higher rate of murders than white people? No. There are a complex web of historical and socioeconomic reasons for this, such as slavery, such as Jim Crow, such as mass incarceration of black fathers via the war on drugs.

Well there's a complex web of phenomena behind this. Men today did not invent the expectation that men should make the first move in dating, or male ""toughness"" & ""boys don't cry"", or the idea that a rejection is somehow an insult. Those things are nasty inheritances that have arisen from the fact that our societies have developed in a patriarchal manner, and these expectations have proven difficult to shed.

Campaigns and governing are two completely different things.  You have to win campaigns to govern.  Democrats screwed that one up in 2016 and the blame should start at the top.  Two years later it’s still blame sexism, blame white people. Whomp Whomp.

5271,">Following Clinton’s impassioned speech, Adichie (clad in hot pink for the occasion) joined her on stage. Together, they covered topics from Clinton’s hesitation to display emotion publicly—growing up in the 1950s, she said, was a time in which exhibiting any kind of emotion was “the worst thing you could do”—to the problem of Clinton’s likability (Adichie: “I kept thinking, Who the hell cares? She’s qualified!”). The two discussed the last few years of Clinton’s life, in and out of politics. Clinton, in turn, gave her answers with more candor than we’re generally privy to; when asked, for example, about the untruths that the public has believed about her, she cited an Ohio State study that detailed the significant influence of three stories on Obama voters who either didn’t vote in 2016 or voted for Trump or a third party. “The three were: that I was dying,” she said, incredulously. “The second was that the Pope had endorsed Trump. And the third was that I was supplying weapons to ISIS. Now, why do people believe that? Well, partly because those stories are delivered in a way that looks like news.” ",,dxzc83c,hillaryclinton

There's a narcissist with the office of the presidency and his own media empire. He's pretty good at getting attention. So yea people who don't pay enough attention only hear about Trump. I just don't see how that has to do with Democrats, their goals and their messages.

Hillary talked almost entirely about stuff other than Trump but out of an hour long speech the media would grab the few lines opposing Trump and play them endlessly. They do that because it gets ratings because people are infatuated with the narcissist. But unless you have a magic trick that fixes that problem I don't know what you want Democrats to do about it.

Further, half this country thinks stand-up comedians are like the PR department of democrats so when they make jokes about Trump they think all democrats talk about is Trump.

Every time I see this kind of argument about ""corporate money"" from ""progressives"" and Bernie Bros I wonder whether they/you realize the hypocrisy of these statements. You want corporate money out... that's all well and good. But what about your involvement in corporate money? You use smartphones, use Amazon, buy gas etc... isn't that corporate money? That's your money. If you want corporate money out of politics then how do you justify contributing to corporations? What about corporations who help society with their money? 

Money in politics is definitely poisonous in certain ways but it is necessary to get politicians elected. Hence Bernie's donations. 

If democrats stop taking ""corporate money"" as you say, should they stop taking money from individuals who work for corporations?

1723,">I think it was just the media's way of trying to avoid talking about how Trump gave so many people the courage to be horrible people.

Maybe, but the media probably had good reason to avoid talking about that hate. I read somewhere that the easiest way to stop spreading hate and violence is to just stop covering it. What they failed to do and still fail to do is ask ""why are they hating?"" This article by Walsh answers that I think.

The feeling these white men have seems similar to in-office competition. It is natural to feel competitive. It's primal, like if you have a certain pecking order in the office and someone who used to be beneath your position rightfully gets a promotion, dont you feel anxious? Of course you do. Investigative journalists dont get airtime, except for maybe Rachel Maddow. Now, back to the office analogy, that anxiety is supposed to make you work harder.

4146,"Maybe this is a weird thing to focus on, but this article was so oddly framed.  It feels like the writer was talking to an American for the first time and noting all the differences in language, rather than interviewing someone with a lot of wonderful things to say.

Of course Chelsea wouldn't say, for example, ""Well done,"" because that's a British colloquialism, and Chelsea is American.  I'm trying to think of an American equivalent, but we don't really have one, and I feel like that's because, ironically enough, that turn of phrase sounds incredibly condescending to my American ears. 

From what I gathered, the writer has a problem with Chelsea's American syntax, word choice, and construction, and uses that to chastise her for being too aloof.  I think the point the writer was trying to make, if I'm being generous, was that Chelsea is polished (and of course she is, as the writer pointed out, she's always been in the political spotlight), but then she (the writer) called her language clunky, which negates that point.  

I think Chelsea's extremely well-spoken, yes, just like her mother.  But, I'm sick of that being termed as cold, especially from foreign press who, in this case, doesn't seem to understand our speech patterns.  

I loved what Chelsea said, but hated the framing of it.  Maybe the writer could have focused on her meaning, rather than the words used to convey it.  But I guess I should take my own advice and focus on Chelsea instead, too. :)",Thankful_Lez,dzpt6m2,hillaryclinton

No way would moderates have voted for him, and if people did their research, they'd know there's no way any of those proposals would get through Congress.  I think the only person in the world I hate more than I hate Bernie is Trump and there's nothing I'd love more than to see him lose his Senate seat.  And I'm sorry, but the Democratic nomination should go to a Democrat.

The only time they really lost was because of the financial crisis. Other than that, they win by keep drumming up the boogie-man (Hillary). As long as they keep dragging her out, they will keep winning. Everyone is excited for 2018, sorry, they will keep both houses because they will keep running against Hillary. If she would get out of the public eye maybe *MAYBE* the left could win. I am not saying it is fair, I am saying it is reality. I voted for Hillary every chance I had. Facts are Facts. They win because they successfully branded her the villain. They won't lose until the left moves on from their current leadership (all in their 70s) and bring in new leaders. At least the right will have to work and branding new villains. 

Again, Donald Trump is the president. Donald Trump, a reality star buffoon. That is how successful the right was at branding Hillary the boogie-man. Donald Trump wouldn't have beaten any other candidate.

2059,"A white man’s life is different depending on the city, state and region you live in and economics plays a huge role.  If you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.  I didn’t say white men are oppressed and I won’t say their privileged either, they live a human life.  The homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him he’s privileged and that’s why you won’t give him any money.

Even Trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  If white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.

A year ago I moved from Oklahoma to Los Angeles.  The two cultures are so vastly different.  The Democratic Party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country that’s why we are where we are at.  In Oklahoma where I was apart of the Democratic Party, the Hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in Oklahoma as sexist and say that’s why they wouldn’t vote for Clinton but at the very same time we had a female Republican governor running the state.  Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Arizona and many other “Red” states have had female governors while states like New York and California have not.

It’s not about privilege, race or gender it’s about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.  Sad to say but Democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican (Trump  is not average).  Obama brought people together Clinton divided.

He waited a full month after he had lost to concede, while in the meantime setting up his supporters against Hillary and the DNC.

Did you see those speeches?
When he mentioned her name, the  crowds booed and Sanders smiled....then he continued his worthless stumpspeech about millionahs and billionahs.

Sanders is the reason we have trump.

And still, I think a lot of us could have gotten over what happened during the primaries, but after the election was over, he has been none stop attacking the Dems, being on one gigantic egotrip while sweettalking trump and his supporters.

He is no progressive, frankly he's never accomplished shit and his support is slipping (see your latest favorite Harvard-Harris poll).

Also the amount of obstruction and Benghazi/email investigations would have been offensive and disgusting. Plus the Russia investigation may not have been perused as it should be had Hillary won.

Did Sanders contribute to her loss? Yeah you're damn right he did.
When it was all too clear he had lost (after NY and especially after CA) he didnt concede but started to lie to his supporters he could still persuade the supers to vote his way, which was an outright lie.
For over  1,5 months he continued to attack Clinton and the DNC, all but preparing his supporters for the Wikileaks dump days before the convention.

By then his supporters had been convinced BY SANDERS that the DNC had rigged the primaries against him (he used the same rhetoric as trump btw) and they were ripe for wikileaks to ratfuck the left.

And afterwards? Did he really campaign for Hillary as he claimed?
Nope.
I saw his Hillary events: whenever he mentioned her name the crowds booed and he smiled, after which he diverted to his usual stump speeches.

In the 3 months Wikileaks started to dump the Podesta mails, did he ever address his supporters and warn them his own campaign emails wouldnt have looked very much different?

Did he ever warn his supporters Russia was playing them (while he now claims he knew?)?

He's a bitter POS who wanted Hillary to lose and who was planning his 2020 run instead of fighting trump.

That doesnt mean Hillary didnt make mistakes btw, her advertising and her general campaign relied too much on the old ways/ old methods, sure. But seeing how she still won by 3 million voted, Im pretty sure a strong Sanders support from after the CA primary would and could have made all the difference.

Cuomo took office, New York has passed marriage equality, implemented common-sense gun safety laws, and adopted the strongest paid-family leave policy in America,” Clinton said, rehashing achievements that previous speakers had praised. “He is not afraid to take on anyone who tries to hurt this state or our country.”

Clinton also mentioned the accomplishments where she had personally supported Cuomo. “After the heartbreak of the 2016 election, I was overjoyed when Gov. Cuomo announced plans to put an affordable college education available for everyone,” said Clinton, referring to the Excelsior Scholarship. “I was proud to stand with him when New York became the first state to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.”

Cuomo won the party's nomination with 95% of the vote.

After Hoover, the FBI consciously made efforts to avoid even the appearance of impacting upon politics. Even Comey has talked about this. Comey set that aside because he was worried about the public perception of Loretta Lynch announcing that there would be no prosecution.

But he went further when he decided to announce it himself. He editorialized about her behavior in a way that the FBI never has before in regard to a case. Why? Please say something other than this case was different. Please offer some reasons why the FBI should behave so drastically different. If its not about affecting politics, why not just handle the case like every other?

Because it WAS about politics. Just not Democrat vs Republican politics. Comey was trying to maximize the perception of impartiality of the FBI. He was worried about public blowback at the decision and so he tried to walk this fine line.

If it was only about doing what was right he wouldn't have editorialized nor even given such a public press conference in July. If it wasn't about trying to placate Republicans he wouldn't have written those letters in October and November.

That isn't the case and isn't how the electoral college works. Again, you don't understand it.

Because this is a huge, diverse country and letting a handful of liberal urban centers control literally every single presidential election is stupid. We're a union of 50 states.

2001,"It isn't sexism. At least, not JUST sexism. The only ""us and them"" that matters is Capital, and Labor. Republicans, and Democrats. After Labor saw that it was going to be Trump v. Clinton, that was the time to rally behind Clinton with all we had. That's what we did in 2008, and that's what's been done in every election prior to that that's ever been won: One holds one's nose, and picks the lesser of two evils. Splitting the ticket only works for the OTHER team, never one's own.

It was a rookie mistake. It cost us the game. The damage will be severe, and long-lived.

P.S.: Almost forgot another basis of the ""us and them"": Conservatives, mostly male, mostly white (and their financial dependents). And all of the rest of us (and our financial dependents. And there are many more depending on us to get it right than on theirs, because...Capital, Labor...I really thought you guys were too smart to be poached...)",lagan_derelict,e47bq2g,hillaryclinton

""The point being, I’m so happy you’re not being silent. But I want you to talk, if you could, about that decision not to be silent. And also, how are you dealing with the constant barrage of attempts to silence you?
Hillary Clinton

I found this also very curious. Because to the best of my memory, no man who ever lost a presidential election was ever told to shut up and go away. And I’m glad they weren’t, because each had points of view and experiences that were worth hearing about.

I’ve given a lot of thought to this, and I do conclude — and I write about it in my book — that there is this long, long history of trying to silence women. Literally in literature, in the western canon, it goes back to The Odyssey.

Penelope is holding the whole country together while Odysseus is taking his time getting back. She’s raising their son, Telemachus.

There’s a very telling scene where all the usual partiers and others are hanging around, hoping that she’ll finally decide that her husband’s dead and marry one of them so that they can take over. Telemachus is now about 17, so he’s a young man.

His mother comes down, as she always did, to greet people and listen to their complaints and to continue being the glue that held the country together. And her son greets her by saying, “Mother, go back upstairs. Speech is not for women.”

The really terrific classics professor Mary Beard — who some of you know, and if you don’t, look her up — has just written a book about women and power, in which she traces this whole line of being quiet: “Don’t speak. Don’t speak up.”

Now, for everyone saying, “Well, that’s a Hillary Clinton problem.” The people who they’d interview, saying, “Well, of course I would vote for a woman! Just not that woman.” In the last year and a half, what have we seen?""",Danie2009,dy04ex2,hillaryclinton

The recent election, as in the presidential one? As in the election where the Democrats went out of their way to accommodate Bernie's ""policies"" in to their platform and lost? If anything that move probably hurt the Democrats. 

 > Again, the party has lost it's way. And equal rights alone doesn't absolve a parties overwhelming transgressions... 

And here is the twisting of the narrative where y'all imply it's ""only"" about equal rights and use identity politics as a negative. And what are these transgressions? That's a pretty vague statement especially when you're saying that civil rights are secondary to the functionality of a political party. That's something.

> And that's not just my opinion, but it's the opinion of many many many voters. 

No one is disputing that's your opinion. But it's not the opinion of the majority of democrats. If that was the case and the majority of dems felt  the party had lost its way then Bernie would have won the primaries or at the least it would have been a close race but neither happened.

>A lot of long time Democratic voters switched and either voted for trump or a third party candidate and that should speak volumes to you.

Well this is yet another misrepresentation from you. Come on, if you're trying to make a point, be honest instead of making up things and trying to pass them off as facts just because you want to believe it.

>You have to learn to stop taking democratic criticisms against the party as personal attacks and look towards how you can make the party better and inclusive to everyone..

 Where exactly did I take anything as a ""personal attack""? This is exactly why Bernie Bros are so hated - as soon as someone calls out all the lies and misrepresentations y'all throw out, you hit back with condescension like this. It's a pretty low form of discourse.

It's pretty rich to lecture me and other democrats about making the party more inclusive when people like you are actively dismissing equal rights as a secondary issue. Yeah, let's be ""inclusive"" by focusing on one demographic. Tell me how you're being ""inclusive"" by dismissing equal rights and all the economic and humanitarian repercussions?

of course I'm going to post another rant. Do you really expect to lie and misrepresent and get away with it?

**Roger Stone Sought Information on Clinton From Assange, Emails Show**

*Ex-Trump adviser urged intermediary to ask WikiLeaks for specific dates of rival candidate’s communications*

By Shelby Holliday and  Rob Barry

Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone privately sought information he considered damaging to Hillary Clinton from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The emails could raise new questions about Mr. Stone’s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in September, in which he said he “merely wanted confirmation” from an acquaintance that Mr. Assange had information about Mrs. Clinton, according to a portion of the transcript that was made public.

In a Sept. 18, 2016, message, Mr. Stone urged an acquaintance who knew Mr. Assange to ask the WikiLeaks founder for emails related to Mrs. Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal in 2011 when she was secretary of state, referring to her by her initials.

“Please ask Assange for any State or HRC e-mail from August 10 to August 30--particularly on August 20, 2011,” Mr. Stone wrote to Randy Credico, a New York radio personality who had interviewed Mr. Assange several weeks earlier. Mr. Stone, a longtime confidant of Donald Trump, had no formal role in his campaign at the time.

In another email, Mr. Credico then asked Mr. Stone to give him a “little bit of time,” saying he thought Mr. Assange might appear on his radio show the next day. A few hours later, Mr. Credico wrote: “That batch probably coming out in the next drop...I can’t ask them favors every other day .I asked one of his lawyers...they have major legal headaches riggt now..relax.”

Mr. Credico said in an interview with the Journal that he never passed the message on to Mr. Assange or his lawyers, but “got tired” of Mr. Stone “bothering” him, and so told Mr. Stone he had passed along the message. Mr. Credico said he did so because he owed Mr. Stone a favor for helping him book Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson as a guest on his show.

Mr. Stone, in a text message to the Journal, said that Mr. Credico had “provided nothing” to him and that WikiLeaks never handed anything over. Both men deny ever having special access to WikiLeaks’ material.

“I never had possession or access to any Clinton emails or records,” Mr. Stone said, adding that his testimony before the House committee was “complete and accurate.”

Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the emails hadn’t been provided to congressional investigators. “If there is such a document, then it would mean that his testimony was either deliberately incomplete or deliberately false,” said Mr. Schiff, who has continued to request documents and conduct interviews with witnesses despite the committee’s probe concluding earlier this year said.

A lawyer for Mr. Stone, Grant Smith, said the emails hadn’t been turned over to House investigators because they were “not encompassed within the scope of the committee’s request.” Mr. Stone said the emails were preserved at the request of the Senate, which is also conducting a Russian interference probe. Mr. Smith said they hadn’t yet been given to investigators there.

The newly unearthed emails come amid signs that special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is examining Mr. Stone’s role in Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Among other matters, prosecutors have asked about Mr. Stone’s claim to have met with WikiLeaks during the campaign, according to a witness familiar with the investigation.

U.S. officials have said WikiLeaks received material from operatives working on behalf of Russia’s military intelligence group, which Mr. Assange has denied. The Kremlin has denied it meddled in the election.

Messrs. Stone and Credico said they haven’t been contacted by Mr. Mueller’s office, which declined to comment. WikiLeaks didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In the initial email, which included an attachment with photos of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and other documents, Mr. Stone sought to confirm speculation that Mrs. Clinton had unnecessarily supported the decision to “continue bombing Libya” during the height of the country’s civil war in 2011. The conflict ultimately led to Ghadafi’s killing at the hands of opposition forces. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Several weeks after Mr. Stone’s email request, on Oct. 3, 2016, an article ran on Infowars.com, a conservative news outlet to which he frequently contributed during the campaign. The article included some of the same images as Mr. Stone’s initial email to Mr. Credico, and didn’t include any unreleased Clinton-related emails or WikiLeaks material.

The emails appear to be consistent with Mr. Stone’s description in his sworn testimony of Mr. Credico as a “go-between” and an “intermediary” to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, according to a portion of his interview that was made public.

Mr. Credico, who considers himself a supporter of WikiLeaks, has publicly raised questions about the details of Mr. Stone’s claims and in recent weeks has called some of them false.

Mr. Credico said his relationship with Mr. Assange and his team didn’t begin until late August 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder agreed to do his radio show. By that time, Mr. Stone had already claimed to be in touch with Mr. Assange and appeared to predict the release of information damaging to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Stone now says he assumed Mr. Credico was in touch with Mr. Assange during that time.

After earlier asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the House probe, Mr. Credico now says he is willing to talk with investigators. He said he met on Wednesday with the committee’s Democratic staff members for what he called a limited conversation about WikiLeaks, the 2016 campaign and Mr. Stone.

As Mr. Credico has become more vocal about what he says are discrepancies in Mr. Stone’s account, Mr. Stone has responded with a series of threats, according to emails and text messages reviewed by the Journal.

In early April, in one of those emails, Mr. Stone accused Mr. Credico of serving as an informant.

“Everyone says u are wearing a wire for Mueller,” the April 7 email said. Two days later, Mr. Stone wrote: “Run your mouth = get sued.” Mr. Credico denies being an informant.

Mr. Stone said he was warning Mr. Credico against defaming him and urging him to “simply tell the truth.”",wenchette,dzk5hft,hillaryclinton

>It's a pretty powerful trend that the party opposite that of the President gains in midterms

Yes the trend is that the opposite party gains the midterms but trends are not concrete. And that's my point - Hillary knew even when she was running how important it was for down candidates to succeed. You might not agree based on your opinion of her, but she would have made it a priority to get Dems back in power which is what Obama failed at when he became president. She is just more politically astute.

>and Clinton's skills (even her most ardent supporters usually admit) weren't those suited to the bully pulpit and rallying public pressure. 

And this is completely false. You won't see any ardent supporters admit to this because it's completely false. There's a difference to being suited to the bullying pulpit vs getting attention from the media. I don't think you should misrepresent her skills by tying in her supporters. Her supporters know better than anyone else what she can do. Do you think a woman like her would have elected senator twice, run for the nomination in2008 when she lost by a 1% (she probably won the popular vote) and then run again and win handily if she didn't have the skills suited for the ""bully pulpit""? 

>Let's face it, we'd be mid-impeachment trials right now.
And this is where you betray yourself - what exactly what she be impeached about? This is the argument people used to dissuade independents not to vote for her but there's no basis. There's literally nothing that she could be impeached for.  This is the argument the far left uses as a justification for her not being in office which is ridiculous.

>But despite her triangulation she'd be getting obstructed by the whole right as a communist, and from a much more unchastened left as a neoliberal. Not a recipe for productive success.

And again... you assume there would be this partisan politics at play. She might have got obstructed from the right but she could have also prevented all the destructive things Trump and the right have enabled - tax cuts... obamacare under threat... CHIP... DACA... muslim ban... the Paris agreement. All of those things would have been prevented if she was president even with a GOP congress and senate. And the only people on the left who would call her a neoliberal as a negative label (because these people only care about labels) are not in the government.

Either ways, liberal values and policies would be far more protected than they are now even if populist candidates like AOC win. Cause they can win but how do they exactly hope to achieve their socialist rhetoric under a Republican president whether it be Trump or Pence. They have no plan to achieve their ideologies.

A large part of democracy is finding someone who represents you - and a large part of the reciprocal game of politics from the politician’s perspective is to make sure that their views do indeed reflect their constituencies.

3043,"I would never argue she made no mistakes.

In fact, I can list a few more.:P

Now the question is: can you admit Bernie made a huge mistake too?

The key moment in 2016 was imo the morning after Bernie lost the CA primary.

You may remember that rather dramatic moment. The whole press and every politically interested man/ woman was waiting for him to admit defeat, endorse Hillary and go to work.
Not with a huge chip on his shoulder but enthusiastically.

He didnt.
Instead he spoke about how he'd still win, and launched a huge attack on both Hillary and the DNC.

He continued that for 5 full weeks afterwards.
Those 5 weeks are key. They gave us a time period in which Bernie and trump double teamed in their attacks on Hillary.

He created an illusion among his followers he could still win the primaries (which he couldn’t) making their disappointment bigger and bigger.

And then we saw the melodrama at the convention where Bernie’s supporters (not all but a lot) behaved like complete and total scum.
Booing John Lewis? Booing the mothers of the movement?
Booing any POC they could?

Sitting there with their mouths taped and playing the spoiled disgusting drama queens they were?

The months afterwards, I made the silly decision to start working for Our Revolution as a kind of peace offering. I worked on the campaigns of Jayapal and Teachout.
Not a single fucking Berner wanted to work on those campaigns, instead they obsessed over wikileaks and their immature hatred of the woman that won and the dem party.

On the day before the election I wrote a deeply felt passionate plea to the Bernie subs here on reddit begging them to vote for Hillary.
If not for themselves, for minorities, for women, children, Muslims, poc, lgtb.
I warned them how much trump would hurt us.

I was laughed at, yelled at, scorned and ridiculed by the entitled, privileged scumbags who call themselves Bernieorbusters.

And now, we see everything happen that Hillary and we warned for.
Women, poc, lgtb, children are hurting. 
And you or any other Bernie supporter who voted for Hillary are ok, but do not question that :yes Bernie did enormous damage to Hillary's campaign.

He should have campaigned for her from the CA primary on. Should not have taken a leave to write his damn book and most of all: he should have addressed his spoiled privileged supporters not once but over and over again to talk some sense into them about wikileaks, Russian meddling (bots promoting Bernie) and so on and on.

And Jane Sanders should go to hell for her tweet when Bernie endorsed Hillary and told his supporters to vote for her, they shouldn’t always follow/ do what Bernie told them to….

It's true that Trump isn't fit for office for a lot of reasons, but you should probably also run policy based ads too so people know what you're gonna do as president.

All the more so when the media is ignoring the speeches you're giving about policy, and not many people watch the news to begin with.

>Immediately after the Civil War, black men were granted suffrage and were able to hold office, in a multiracial democracy.

**Exhibit B: Russia's hacking of voter rolls**

""They penetrated voter rolls in at least 39 states.

**~ ~ ""All of these things add up quickly in an election that was decided by fewer than 80,000 votes in three states."" ~ ~**

**Exhibit C: Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign** 

""The Russians began leaking these massive dumps of stolen emails through WikiLeaks on the eve of the Democratic convention, and the story line that emerged from those stolen emails was the the DNC was biased against Bernie Sanders. And then the next big tranche of documents was released, very significantly, 29 minutes after the Washington Post reported on the Access Hollywood video in which Donald Trump was heard bragging about grabbing woman by their genitals. And so that last-minute intervention by the Russians via WikiLeaks was incredibly important, which is why Donald Trump mentioned WikiLeaks 164 times in the last month of the campaign. 

~ ~""Nobody would suggest that the Russian intervention was the only factor behind the election outcome, but if you talk to experts like **former FBI agent Clint Watts, what he will tell you is that if it were not for the Russian intervention, Donald Trump would not have been within even striking distance of Hillary Clinton.**

**""I think we have great cause to fear for the security of our elections in 2018 and 2020.** Donald Trump benefited from the Russian intervention in 2016, Donald Trump probably would not be president if it weren't for the Russian intervention in 2016, and he shows very little interest in opposing the Russians."" ~ ~",BumBiddlyBiddlyBum,e3q8h8e,hillaryclinton

2062,"> If you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.

I never said this. Nobody actually ever says this. They say (something like) having white skin is a privilege.  That's different than legit thinking that all white men are privileged. I mean, obviously, we people in Los Angeles don't think this.  We see white homeless folks every day.  The right willfully misinterprets this, just like they did with Black Lives Matter (Too)... not (Only) Black Lives Matter.  To be honest, I'd like there to be a better word than 'privilege,' because it gets easily misinterpreted... but, then, when you have a massive machine trying to discredit liberals who want to get rid of the bigoted oppression of individuals based on what 'group' they belong to, any phrase you use will get twisted to be intentionally misunderstood.   

""Sad to say but Democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican.""  This is far from true.  Most Republicans voted for Trump.  He is a fascist bigot who openly stated he wanted to ban all Muslims from entering America.  You are engaging in a false equivalency.  

""It’s not about privilege, race or gender."" For people who are oppressed, daily, based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion?  Yes, it is about that.  A poor black dude faces oppression that a poor white dude does not.  This doesn't mean a poor white dude has an easy life - that's not how existence works.  Like, the fact that my skin color doesn't cause me to be oppressed... that doesn't mean my life is sunshine, roses, gold, and happiness. 

It's just that society does not oppress a poor white dude because of his whiteness. 

The greatest trick ever pulled was to oppress people based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion... And then, when folks try to fight back against identity-based oppression, yell that the folks pushing back against that evil are the ones engaging in divisive 'identity politics.'

>**Here are the key things people should know about Donald Trump. He comes from a family of criminals**: His grandfather made his fortune running whorehouses in Seattle and in the Yukon Territory. His father, Fred, had a business partner named Willie Tomasello, who was an associate of the Gambino crime family. Trump's father was also investigated by the U.S. Senate for ripping off the government for what would be the equivalent of $36 million in today's money. Donald got his showmanship from his dad, as well as his comfort with organized criminals.

>I think it is very important for religious Americans to know that Donald Trump says that his personal philosophy of life is revenge. He has called anyone who turns the other cheek -- which is a fundamental teaching of Christ in the Sermon on the Mount -- a fool, an idiot or a schmuck. Trump is a man who says things that are absolutely contrary to the teachings of the New Testament. He also denigrates Christians. Yet you see all of these ministers endorsing him.

That's the part that has him dead to rights. Because he can't even fess up and apologize for that. Instead he still wants to pretend like he was some straight-edge kind-hearted kid. The joke is obvious and clear to everyone. It's right there in plain view where literally the whole country can see it and Kavenaugh is still peddling bullshit and conservatives are still pretending to buy it.

The fact that half this country will pretend to believe him and far too many more will humor this bullshit is why we are in this kind of mess in the first place.

Which is why the correct thing to do would've been to say absolutely nothing about the new lead unless it actually turned up something (which it didn't). By attempting to keep the FBI nonpartisan *he made it partisan*. And if the NY FBI would've leaked it? That's his fault too. He ran the organization. He couldn't get his house in order and it led him to make a distinctly Hooverian decision. 

The *only* argument I'm even somewhat sympathetic to is that Lynch shouldn't have met Bill on the tarmac and put him in the position where the FBI had to take the lead on the case. But even in that instance, he didn't have to campaign against Clinton. 

What really pissed me off about that interview tonight was his line about the public needing to be accountable for for electing Trump. Motherfucker played a *bigger role than goddamn anyone* in making that happen, and all he does is make excuses for it.

People tried to make a thing about Hillary and Bernie’s age who are 70 and 74! Feinstein is 84 years old.  2. Because of this she’s resistant to new ideas like legal weed and health care of all and not taking corporate money. Her policies for being California representative are not as liberal as they should be. Her positions are what I’d expect of a Wisconsins Senators Democrat not California’s!. And she’s only recently updated her opinions during primary season. That bugs me even more because it shows she a fake.

I've lived in Europe for a long time and I prefer what every western european country has: a hybrid system.

Basically, the government should provide for lower income people + the basic healthcare needed and people can buy additional insurance through a private insurance company.

I've yet to see a country with single payer or with what comes close to single payer (dont forget pure single payer is extremely rare) which didnt have huge waitinglists, or a completely clogged up healthcare system.

Try needing a doctor in england or Italy (two countries which come close to single payer in western europe)...
Christ, I had a simple ear infection this summer and I sat in an emergency room (for an ear infection...) for 5 freaking hours.

I prefer the system in germany, the netherlands, belgium and the scandinavian countries.
They have high quality healthcare, everyone is covered and its a hybrid system.

And: like hendrixpm just posted: single payer should never be a litmus test.

3654,"Yes I'm not denying he said any of those things. But those words are not him supporting identity politics... in fact, he uses them as a basis for dismissing identity politics. I mean, he claims he wants to see more Latinos and African Americans in government but then he immediately dismisses their identity as a factor when in fact he should consider that their identity plays a big role in their politics. 

He assumes that this lady, just because she identifies as Latino and is a woman, doesn't care about economic issues. That's his fallacy there - he can't see that someone who is a woman and a minority can also address economic issues.

>And even though you dont like Bernie, he is more in favour of women rights, than Sarah Palin would have been as Vice-President... so clearly I have to agree: Being black, a latina/-o or a women is not enough.

Why are you bringing up Sarah Palin like she's someone I'm using as a litmus test? Again, this is the problem with Bernie and his die-hards - he uses identity as a litmus test. I supported Hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. I didn't support Palin cause she was a woman. I don't admire Condoleeza cause she was a woman. You guys need to stop conflating gender in this way and behaving like support for a woman or a minority is just down to the identity.

And my problem with Bernie is exavctly this - he rails against identity politics yet he's the one who reduces his opponents to their identities. He did with Hillary and he's done it with other candidates he's run against in the past. And he's actively dismissed issues that concern women and minorities at the same time.

There's a narcissist with the office of the presidency and his own media empire. He's pretty good at getting attention. So yea people who don't pay enough attention only hear about Trump. I just don't see how that has to do with Democrats, their goals and their messages.

Hillary talked almost entirely about stuff other than Trump but out of an hour long speech the media would grab the few lines opposing Trump and play them endlessly. They do that because it gets ratings because people are infatuated with the narcissist. But unless you have a magic trick that fixes that problem I don't know what you want Democrats to do about it.

Further, half this country thinks stand-up comedians are like the PR department of democrats so when they make jokes about Trump they think all democrats talk about is Trump.

1828,"Yeah definitely operating on different dimensions... specifically where you're talking about someone about whom you clearly have no idea about apart from hearsay and prejudiced propaganda/narrative. Which is sad.

The fact that you're reducing her career down to connections and ""list of favors"" proves your perception of her. You won't give her credit for her accomplishments because she was wife to Bill. And also you make false claims to support your perception which is really disingenuous - to you the only reason she was senator was because she pulled strings... have you even taken a moment to look at what she did as Senator of NY?

And btw she did run against primary candidates - they lost the first time and even harder the second time because she served NY well. There's a reason they love her in NY.  You're insinuating a lot of things here... why don't you back them up with facts?

And yes she did win handily in the 2016 primaries - she beat Bernie by almost 3 million votes - that's not close at all. In 2008 she lost to Obama by less than300,000 votes. So yes her victory in the 2016 primary was more than comfortable. If you disagree and want to imply it was rigged (like y'all usually do) then provide receipts instead of hurt egos.

You might not like her but at least you should know some facts about her instead of resorting to the tired ""establishment"" bullshit. I don't like Bernie and I can give you a list of FACTS why. You're even making up shit about her Senate primaries now. That's ridiculous. At the least you should be able to justify your hate for her on actual facts.

>The more left populists like OSC win, the more people recognize they can win and succeed that way, until even the party can't fail to recognize it. 

Yeah sorry but AOC winning in NY isn't an indication of the leftist populist movement across the country and that's been proven with a lot of primary wins.  The party isn't going to automatically endorse far left candidates accross the country because states like NY elect them. And regardless, populist candidates have been running and they've lost - why can't you accept that? Bernie lost. And a lot of the candidates he endorsed lost as well. At the end of the day you can't look beyond the party when it's about your beliefs - sorry but there are democrats who are not ""far left"". And we're going to elect people who are not ""far left"". The label of ""socialism"" only matters to you guys cause we're for policies that are leftist and liberal.

Bernie never did anything of substance in Congress.

Yet evangelicals want us to believe that God got it wrong, that somehow things changed and now abortion should be the same as murder.

>Research by Dr. Cikara and others shows that when one group feels threatened, it makes it much easier to think about people in another group as less than human and to have little empathy for them — two psychological conditions that are conducive to violence.

~

>As Dr. Fiske has written, “Both science and history suggest that people will nurture and act on their prejudices in the worst ways when these people are put under stress, pressured by peers, or receive approval from authority figures to do so.”

>**So when someone like President Trump dehumanizes his adversaries, he could be putting them beyond the reach of empathy, stripping them of moral protection and making it easier to harm them.**

>If you still have any doubt about the power of political speech to foment physical violence, consider the classic experiment by the Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram, who in the early 1960s studied the willingness of a group of men to obey an authority figure.

>Subjects were told to administer electrical shocks to another participant, without knowing that the shocks were fake. Sixty-five percent of the subjects did what they were told and delivered the maximum shock, which if real could have been fatal. The implication is that we can easily be influenced by authority to do terrible harm to others — just by receiving an order.

1989,"Nobody is telling you what you should be concerned about. I'm telling you what I am concerned about, which is the left devolving into a competing tapestry of identity interest groups without any synergy, which is precisely what you are doing when you label me a ""white guy"", imply that I am ""telling [you] what [you] should be concerned about"", and assuming that I ""get mad at women for 'leading men on'"".

Actually, I'm extremely familiar with the problems that aggressive male sexual behaviour cause for women. I've listened to my partner describe harassment on the street and in public locations by men on a daily and weekly basis for as long as I have known her. The real question is how to improve the situation, and while I don't have a firm answer for that I know that addressing the question will be ten times harder with a Republican president, house, and Senate.

54,"I strongly disagree.  For one, the Democratic candidate will only need to pick up PA, WI, and MI over what Clinton won in 2016.  Those states are already shifting back into our column.  It seems unlikely that unless we did something profoundly stupid (e.g. nominated Sanders) that we would be at risk of losing any of the states that Clinton won in 2016.

Next, your argument almost has to be that you think Trump would beat any woman who runs. The candidates in the poll span the (Democratic side of the) political spectrum.  Sen. Klobuchar is so moderate that in MN she has a >50% approval rating among men, women, Democrats, Republicans, and independents.  Obviously Warren is at the left side of the party, but she likely has a strong appeal in the midwestern states that went for Sanders in the 2016 primaries.  Then Harris is (probably) somewhere in the middle, with the additional advantage of having only 4 years in the senate minority—there aren’t a lot of votes to hold against her.

I spent four hours waiting in an exam room.  Turned out I needed stitches - which I suspected when the bleeding wasn't stopping.  They also did a tetanus shot since we don't know what caused the bleeding and some blood work to make sure nothing was infected.

If a woman doesn't want to go through a pregnancy and have something in her body that she doesn't want there, she shouldn't have to.  And if a woman doesn't want to parent, then that would be unfair to everyone involved.  If I got pregnant again, an abortion would be the only option. I'm in my 20s, in school full time, working 30 hours a week, making less than 20K a year and unmarried. Additionally, I know that I'm not prepared emotionally to raise a child. I know some people talk about adoption, but it would absolutely kill me for the baby that I carried to be considering another woman his or her mother. Some young women talk about how they keep their babies because they love them too much to give them up, but the fact is, loving the baby isn't enough. Love isn't going to provide food or shelter or insurance, money will do that, and I barely have enough to support myself, let alone a child. Even birth control isn't 100% effective.

1661,"> Worrying overmuch about policy detail is actually sort of useless until that situation is on the horizon.

Actually worrying about policy detail is anything but useless and this where the problem lies at the moment.

Populist politics is extremely dangerous - we're seeing it with Trump right now. We've seen it with the Germans pre-WWII when their brand of populism failed and allowed extremists to take over. That's what is happening now.

Populism is dangerous whether its from the left or the right. There's no point in electing candidates on the basis of their rhetoric if they can't deliver once in office. Populism feeds the masses without actually providing actual solutions. It's a power play tactic. 

If the voting public actually care about how laws are changed then they should care enough not to vote on rhetoric alone because we all know that fizzles out eventually. 

Policy detail is exactly the thing we need to be thinking about in progressive candidates. For far too long we've had so called progressive candidates who have been elected on their rhetoric and then have failed to deliver once in office. You call it the establishment but they did exactly what people like ACO are doing now to get elected.

They use populist rhetoric to get elected and then stay in office for years without doing anything. This is exactly the thing we should be fighting against.

They'll do the same to Bernie and anyone else who ends up leading the Democrats. It's naive to think otherwise and make this just about Hillary.

The only reason Fox news is still obsessed about Hillary is simply because despite her loss she is still the most powerful voice on the Democrats' side.

Donald Trump wouldn't have beaten any other candidate? You know that for a fact right? You know that cause Bernie was scrutinized by the right and Fox News? 

The truth, which is difficult for Fox News, GOP and Bernie Bros to accept, is that Hillary's loss didn't reflect the will of the majority of the country. Her loss was because of a flawed system.

All just my opinion, but the overgrown scrotum that is the leader of the Senate Majority has an iron grip on his party. If she’s openly opposing potential judicial nominees now without much backlash it’s because he’s letting her.

""The point being, I’m so happy you’re not being silent. But I want you to talk, if you could, about that decision not to be silent. And also, how are you dealing with the constant barrage of attempts to silence you?
Hillary Clinton

I found this also very curious. Because to the best of my memory, no man who ever lost a presidential election was ever told to shut up and go away. And I’m glad they weren’t, because each had points of view and experiences that were worth hearing about.

I’ve given a lot of thought to this, and I do conclude — and I write about it in my book — that there is this long, long history of trying to silence women. Literally in literature, in the western canon, it goes back to The Odyssey.

Penelope is holding the whole country together while Odysseus is taking his time getting back. She’s raising their son, Telemachus.

There’s a very telling scene where all the usual partiers and others are hanging around, hoping that she’ll finally decide that her husband’s dead and marry one of them so that they can take over. Telemachus is now about 17, so he’s a young man.

His mother comes down, as she always did, to greet people and listen to their complaints and to continue being the glue that held the country together. And her son greets her by saying, “Mother, go back upstairs. Speech is not for women.”

The really terrific classics professor Mary Beard — who some of you know, and if you don’t, look her up — has just written a book about women and power, in which she traces this whole line of being quiet: “Don’t speak. Don’t speak up.”

Now, for everyone saying, “Well, that’s a Hillary Clinton problem.” The people who they’d interview, saying, “Well, of course I would vote for a woman! Just not that woman.” In the last year and a half, what have we seen?""",Danie2009,dy04ex2,hillaryclinton

I did. How did I manage that? 

> And what does her husband's strategy have to do with her? 

Her campaign included good things she did as First Lady. If you read articles from the 1990s, they all call her the most politically-involved First Lady ever. Many articles are mad about this, saying that it’s an unconstitutional expansion of the executive branch. She could show up at an event and it was like the President had shown up - like there were two Presidents. Her time as First Lady then launched the rest of her political career. Her husband campaigned for her, and her campaigns followed the Clintonism script quite exactly. 

If the accomplishments of the White House when she was First Lady count, so do the failings.

2799,I’ve considered the NYT a fairly garbage outlet and completely out of touch with America for a long time now. They absolutely hated Hilary and didn’t even run a single interview with Orcasio-Cortez until two days AFTER her upset win... and she lives in the fucking Bronx.,2rio2,e2digmt,hillaryclinton

230,"I worked for Hillary in 2016. The problem wasn't just the far left, it was a lack of energy for her supporters as well. I never had as hard of a time getting volunteers as I did for Hillary, even her biggest supporters were so burnt out by the end of the elections that I couldn't squeeze more than one knocking shift out of them.  


Don't get me wrong, maybe she could've won if the far left came in from the cold, but the fact is that many other candidates would've won handily because of how they motivated their base. This last election shouldn't have been an issue, democrats should've won the presidency easily. ",I_am_ur_daddy,e8p0zj1,hillaryclinton
2053,"I read the article and it was poorly written and went all over the place.  

A lack of empathy creates entitlement, that’s human nature.

Progressive and liberals have a sense of empathy for the issues women and people of color have.  Conservatives speak to the issues of white Americans and have empathy for their issues.  The civil rights acts of 64 and 65 created this demographic shift, right or wrong that’s the nature of the two parties.

Being called racist and sexist is what white men deal with within the Democratic Party.  I personally experienced at the county state and national level with other Democrats that I would meet.  Denying racism or sexism I’ve experienced is no different than denying racism or sexism anyone else experiences.

Democrats need to understand and address the issues white men experience to win elections across the country.  If they want to remain a party for the coasts of the US we are in for a long ride.

Labeling a white man as entitled without understanding his experience doesn’t address the issue democrats face demographically but was a common tactic Hillary Supporters used and Obama Supporters did not.  That’s why he won and she couldn’t.

Is a homeless white man entitled?  Is a working blue collar white man entitled? Is a white male war vet entitled?

I don’t think so.

Is a wealthy white man who sits at the top of Trump tower entitled?

Of course!  But it doesn’t mean every white man is entitled..... ",MachoMug,e45975l,hillaryclinton

5747,"""Qualifications"" are the sort of thing people only get excited about once they already agree with someone politically or want them to win badly for some other reason. Then all of a sudden if they're well-qualified, it becomes the big obvious justification for why supporting them is objectively ""right"" and supporting anyone else is objectively ""wrong"" and ""stupid"".

Since there's never been a woman President, women who cared a lot about that assumed her qualifications would be a huge card to play against her male opponents. But nobody cared, that is, nobody who didn't already think she was a good fit for office based on their own political metrics. So now, like some sort of PTSD cases, her adherents are left insisting ""qualifications"" have always been the best thing to look for in candidates, and it's a big strange absurd farce that the most ""qualified"" candidate didn't win -- even though that happens at least half the time if not actually more.

 We are facing the crisis that we do because Republicans  have been highly disciplined and organized. The Democratic cause in this moment requires us to do the same. We need to be long-term, strategic, well-financed and well-aligned. We also must act at the local, state and national levels simultaneously and in sync, resolute in each forum in which power is contested: redistricting, legislative action, electoral work, leadership development. We have finally seen that for too long up close what happens when that power is uncontested. Most especially here in Texas where it’s considerable damage to our State has lay bear. 

Right-wing control in a majority of states most especially Texas has been exploited to draw congressional and state legislative district lines that perpetuate minority voting power to lock in a distorted majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and shut democrats out of meaningful presence in state houses. Yet at this pivotal moment in time the Democratic Party seems to have a awkward and disjointed game plan on recruited candidates and Electoral strategy. With the myriad of polling recently showing the liar and chief strengthening and democratic candidates generic ballot shrinking something is not aligned correctly.

The Democrats cannot reclaim power or leadership until we can give voice to the widespread economic insecurities felt throughout America and deliver!! Lies  drew some voters, to a con artist lying bastard like Trump. HOWEVER they were effective in the first place because democrats failed to connect, but when the lies and bs implode like we have seen voters will not just vote for dems,  (again recent polling) unless they believe we can deliver and I'm afraid we are potentially screwing ourselves out of yet another election that is ours to win.

1185,">Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh decided that to have any chance to reach the court, he would have to shed the pretense he was a fair-minded, calm, judicious thinker. **He came out in the afternoon filled with venom, screaming at the committee. His life was being ruined, he claimed. This was a Clinton-like smear.** His anger was both **frightening and unexpected** — if you thought he was that intellectual whom conservatives have swooned over. He yelled, and he cried. If you thought he was sincere, one could also appreciate how **partisan and emotional** he had become.

~

>If President Trump loved the nasty, male grievance game, the rest of us had reason to wonder if anyone of this temperament — Cornyn, Graham or Kavanaugh — should be in a position of power. **If they were women, they would be called “hysterical.”**

~

>The refusal to get the facts is both a telling admission of concern about what they would find and a violation the judicial goal of truth-seeking. It’s **a political calculation, exactly what you don’t want to see from a judge**.

~

>The worst moment was his confrontation with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) who questioned him about blackout drinking. She explained that she understood alcohol abuse because her father was an alcoholic. Have you ever blacked out? she asked. He sneered in response, “Have you?” It was **a moment of singular cruelty and disrespect**. One saw a flash in the exchange with Klobuchar the same **sense of entitlement, cruelty and lack of simple decency** that Christine Blasey Ford allegedly experienced way back when, the memory seared in her brain of two obnoxious teens laughing at her ordeal.

~

>Kavanaugh says he was not the attacker. But even if you believe that — despite Ford’s riveting testimony — one can reasonably conclude he is not the right person to sit on the court. **His anger toward liberals is palpable, his lack of humility bracing. He has the partisan mindset that opponents are unworthy of respect and kindness.**

~

>... his heart is that of a **conservative partisan**, one who tried so very hard to make himself into Supreme Court material. The **mentality of a political operative** — willing to go on Fox News, **ready to inflame passions, disrespectful toward opponents** — is still there. A nonpartisan would ask for, if not demand, an FBI investigation and Judge’s appearance. Kavanaugh wants to avoid both at all costs.

That's only something that you can do from a viewpoint that is racist in nature.

There's a good chance that you were called racist or sexist in relation to your behavior, but you didn't see your own behavior that way, so you think it's just because you're a white guy.

I'm a white guy.  I have never been called racist or sexist or anything of the sort, except for the relatively few times I deserved it.  It's not that hard.

EDIT:  You don't seem to understand that the plight of any individual white man is not related to his manness or his whiteness, so there's no need to defend those identities  (since they're not the targets of oppression)... that only makes sense from a white supremacist POV.

Yes, it is important to push back against the oppression of individuals based on their race, sex, orientation, religion, and gender.

White men are simply not oppressed based on their race or sex.  To act as though there's an oppression that needs to be pushed back against is white supremacy.

2879,"**Hillary Clinton was exactly right about Trump being Putin's puppet**

She tweeted, ""Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?""

Cue the flame emoji for a serious political social media burn.

Regardless of whether Clinton expected an answer to her tweeted question, she got one. The President of the United States clearly demonstrated to the world exactly which team he plays for: Russia.

""I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,"" Trump said at a news conference with Putin, regarding his belief that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

His message could not have been clearer: I trust what Putin tells me, despite what the US intelligence community uncovers about Russian election meddling.

Trump has been bashing the US intelligence community from day one of his presidency, famously labeling the Russia investigations as a ""witch hunt,"" and very publicly feuding with the FBI.

And Trump continues to be dismissive of them even now, despite the comprehensive report by the CIA, NSA, FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, all concluding with ""high confidence"" that there was Russian interference during the 2016 presidential campaign.

It may seem that Hillary Clinton's tweet predicted a disappointing display of Trump's allegiance to Putin, but Trump may just have fulfilled a prophecy that Clinton made before he was even elected president.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton famously called out Trump, implying that he would be Putin's ""puppet.""

""You encouraged espionage against our people. You are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list: break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do,"" Clinton said. ""You continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race.""

And she was right. Trump's clear anti-NATO remarks have generally aligned with Russia's sentiment about the organization; his expressions of admiration for Putin have played right into the Russian leader's hand.

And then came the fated Trump-Putin summit, and Trump's failure to condemn Russia for the coordinated cyberattacks during the 2016 presidential campaigns. This was particularly bold given that just last week, the Justice Department announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officials for interference in the election. Trump has, once again, proven that Clinton's prediction was spot on.

Heck, there's even a #SheWarnedUs hashtag on Twitter documenting all the times Hillary told us how the Trump presidency would pretty much unfold from the get-go.

With Trump's track record, there was no reason to believe Trump would not, once again, take Russia's side.

After today's press conference, Democrats and Republicans are both speaking out against Trump's comments, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating that ""there is no question that Russia interfered in our elections,"" and acknowledging the need to recognize that Russia ""is not our ally.""

John Brennan, the former CIA director labeled Trump's comments ""nothing short of treasonous.""

As members of both parties distance themselves from the President's comments on Putin and are largely still absorbing the shock of having an American president openly side with and embrace a known adversary of his country, the one glaring truth we must all accept is that it was possible to see this coming. And Hillary Clinton did.

After witnessing the summit, Clinton herself had tweeted a response to her initial question: ""Well, now we know,"" the tweet read.

She knew all along which team Trump would play on -- and by now we should, too.

The F****king hypocritical GOP gets on my damn nerves. The woefully ignorant and those who didn't vote make me sick every damn day! And these people see nothing wrong in Donald Drumpf.

There have been countless examples of Trump v any other political individual and nobody gives a hoot. Mark my word, I long for the day Trump resigns. So help me GOD because this indivudal should not be at 1600 Penn. Everything he does is out of spite and ego, with ignorance magnified tenfold. He speaks gibbrish, communicates in lies, lies lies and lies. All of these people LIE!  AND the F####king Ryan and McConnel say 'oh well' our voters are too stupid.

Never again, never again shall there be another Trump. The stakes were very clear and present, and throughly explained leading up to the election, and significant parts of Wisconsoin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio (I think) all said Let's try this guy. ""LETS TRY THIS GUY"". A know-nothing, endemic narcissist, corrupt, lying, sexual harasser, self-aggrandizing, pompous, caustic, rude, man! Whose whole character SCREAMED not PRESIDENTIAL.

Yet people have the nerve to complain today ""Oh my God, he tore up the IRAN deal"" This man said during the debates that he had no qualms bombing families and the causalties that came with that!

But my GOD--the nerve from some journalists to media outlets that these people had to put TRUMP and Former First Lady, Secretary, Senator, Magna Cum Laude on same playing field! Just a Joke!

And the stain, from History onward will not be kind to America. We need a course correct like yesterday! Vote, encourage others to Vote, Trump and his cohorts cannot continue in this manner of violating norms, and denigrating institutions. It just cannot be.

When that happened, it dominated the news cycle for awhile. Plus, the President revoking security clearances because he disagrees with them politically is not something that was done before Trump.

My interpretation of this is that Hillary would rather voluntarily give up her security clearance rather than having it *revoked* because 1) revocation would create a bigger news story, the press would rehash 2016, and more important issues would be ignored and 2) she doesn't want to take part in establishing this new precedent of the President revoking security clearances for people he doesn't like.

Trump doesn't agree with shit. He's a demagogue who changes his positions as often as his socks. He was pro-choice for years, defiantly so, giving money to pro-choice groups and candidates. And then, suddenly, he shifted his position to dupe poor fools like you.

The democrats are so much more to left  than they were then and nothing comparable to Reagan's cons.

Every thing you are saying is completely off-point. Modern democrats who are centrists are anything but Republican. 

I mean, your rational is completely absurd because you think being centrist is as bad as being a modern day Republican? ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?
'
You've laid out issues that Democrats have been fighting for and made actual ground on before far leftists decided they wanted to burn down all the progress.

Your outrage is not only false but also insulting because you've completely ignored all the progress that liberal democrats have made in a conservative government... that's the power of centrists. Whereas far leftists have never achieved ANYTHING.

You want to talk about pulling back to the left... since 2008 we've pulled to the left tremendously and we could have done more so if Hillary was elected. So how are the centrists the bad guys here?

The way I see it, someone like Bernie who's ""leftist"" has achieved NOTHING in his entire career. Just a bunch of hot air.  Whereas real LEADERS who have been more centrist have done way more.

If they didn't succeed with those hearings in front of a GOP congress and Senate then they certainly wouldn't have success if she were in office even with a GOP house and Senate. 

It was just posturing to deter the lazy independents and skeptical moderate republicans.

And then think about this, would McConnel and the GOP with a majority in the house and the senate really waste time trying to impeach Hillary when all it would result in would be Tim Kaine become president? That means they would effectively waste 2 years of house and senate majority achieving nothing.
