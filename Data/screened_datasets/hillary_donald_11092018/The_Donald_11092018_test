"SF population is nearly a million. 61% of 46% of that is 280,000 people. If 65% of these are liberals, that's a net export of 182000 libtards for Texas. Conservatives better start having babies and instilling conservative values and guarding against libtard brainwashing. ",Big_Shot_Gangster,e9cywwi,The_Donald

"It's literally an ideological virus.  It infects a host.  Sometimes pretends to be something it isn't, sometimes hides in the shadows, sometimes overwhelms.

"We are having the same problem in Florida with the influx of liberal Puerto Ricans who came after maria. I don't blame them, they don't know any better because they have been brain washed by socialists. 

We need more red pill dispensers. Conservative values classes should be mandatory in school. The liberals already push their indoctrination anyway. Maybe the Heritage Foundation can come up with a curriculum. ",ProgrammaticallyLog3,e9cvyqe,The_Donald
"it's simply amazing to me that people who fuck up their states like california, oregon, illinois and others move to other areas and then CONTINUE, CONTINUE to vote for the same policies and have the SAME mentality that doomed their home state to begin with and it starts dooming the state they MOVE TO.

It's a sickness of the mind.  ",Atrand,e9cyzqq,The_Donald
"This is what happens when people are told that the problems and hardships in their lives are not of their own creation or responsibility.

They are told that hardships and problems are created by their ideological enemies and that they are noble for spreading their forward ideas to these problematic parts of the country.

San Francisco isn't bad, it's the fault of the rest of the country. Once they bring progressivism to these backwoods hick towns then the problems and hardships will disappear.

They are literally too stupid or zealous to realize that they've ever done anything wrong or had a bad idea. ",ThrowDeadAway,e9d0xfn,The_Donald

"I'm sure there are tons of conservatives in that mix. I am a native San Diegan, and although it's a military town, it's very liberal. All the conservatives that I know are pretty quiet about it. I've been followed/harassed/flipped off on the road for having conservative stickers on my car, and had said stickers torn off my car. Now that sleazy Newsom is in office, I see the state going downhill fast. If I were to move, Texas would be high on the list because of its *mostly* conservative reputation and less strict gun laws.

While I would never want to live in San Fran because I think it is a shithole city, it IS where a lot of the great paying jobs are for people in the tech/digital industry. That's attractive regardless of your political persuasions (I'm in that industry.) 

I like to think that some of the people leaving SF are fed up with seeing a beautiful city go to crap under democratic rule, and they may be leaning more toward a moderate or conservative vote in the future. ",SlipperyAnnie,e9cznjn,The_Donald
"I believe a huge part of the problem is our banking system.  Every american ends up in debt because of the Fed - but they don't even feel it. This creates perverse incentives to keep adding new social programs that liberals know we can never pay for - but they are very popular.

Even Trump can't fix them - as a result we are hurtling towards disaster..  It's basically like maxing out all your credit cards and then getting new ones.. People like Cortez want state paid healthcare, college and housing. 

But its not REALLY state paid - its debt paid. ",DontApologize,e9d1j0e,The_Donald

"Most people moved to San Francisco for a job and then found it to be too expensive, so they decide to move somewhere cheaper because the city has a lot of problems with housing and homelessness.

They’re coming from all over the country and then going all over the country. Texas is a popular destination because it’s cheap and easier to raise a family, and if you’re not making a fuckload of money you can still live very comfortably. The comments here are really alarmist and over the top, but the reality is that rich land owners and shitty development laws made the place hard for average people to live. They try, find that they can’t afford it, and leave. Out of all the people I’ve met in SF, about 1/20 are actually from California",Endur,e9d1rqh,The_Donald

This has nothing to do with politics - this is business.
