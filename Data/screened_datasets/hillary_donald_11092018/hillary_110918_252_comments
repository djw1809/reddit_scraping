Whatever your political affiliations, it seems to me only reasonable for the POTUS, the **First Citizen**, the **Princeps**, should be someone who tries to set a good example of how a person should behave.

Take Mike Pence.  I'm a Liberal, I cannot stand the mans policies.  However, after the #MAGABOMBER attacks he *immediately* came to the defense of the targeted victims.  He behaved with a degree of grace and dignity that made me respect him.  Our retired POTUS 43 was, IMO, a headache in office.  However, he behaved and *behaves* in a manner that inspires respect and emulation.

Our current POTUS is a toxic influence who inspires anti-Semites, Misogynists and Racists to murderous and bloody action.  He **must** go, and swiftly, or, it seems to me, the U.S.A. will descend into an even bloodier state of civil strife **that it is already in**.

>Research by Dr. Cikara and others shows that when one group feels threatened, it makes it much easier to think about people in another group as less than human and to have little empathy for them — two psychological conditions that are conducive to violence.

~

>As Dr. Fiske has written, “Both science and history suggest that people will nurture and act on their prejudices in the worst ways when these people are put under stress, pressured by peers, or receive approval from authority figures to do so.”

>**So when someone like President Trump dehumanizes his adversaries, he could be putting them beyond the reach of empathy, stripping them of moral protection and making it easier to harm them.**

>If you still have any doubt about the power of political speech to foment physical violence, consider the classic experiment by the Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram, who in the early 1960s studied the willingness of a group of men to obey an authority figure.

>Subjects were told to administer electrical shocks to another participant, without knowing that the shocks were fake. Sixty-five percent of the subjects did what they were told and delivered the maximum shock, which if real could have been fatal.

-Grover Cleveland won the 1888 popular vote but lost the election, then came back and won four years later in 1892.

-Richard Nixon barely lost the presidential election of 1960, then decided to run for president again and won in 1968.

So not only is there precedence for a candidate who won the popular vote running again and winning, but there's also precedence for someone who already ran for president and lost running again and winning.

And in fact, *every* person who won the popular vote for president and lost the election who then ran again *all* won the next time. Of presidential candidates who won the popular vote but weren't elected president, there are only those who won on their next run (Jackson, Cleveland) and those who just didn't run again (Samuel Tilden, Al Gore) who nevertheless would've had strong cases if they'd wanted to run again.",blitheobjective,e8o5dhv,hillaryclinton

And we know she's strong enough to take it and strong enough to weather Republicans hating her and Russia doing everything it can to take her down including trying to craft a narrative that everyone hates her, despite the fact she won more votes than Donald Trump and the second-most votes in U.S. history.

What people aren't realising is that Russia and the GOP hate machine won't go away if Hillary doesn't run again. They are priming for anyone who wins the Dem nomination. Biden, Harris, Duckworth, Booker, Sanders, whomever, once they're the Dem nominee they will be just as hated and just as maligned online by an army of bots making it seem real and cool to hate them and the GOP will make them the devil incarnate like they did Hillary.

This GOP hate machine didn't even start with Clinton. It started with Obama, they made him the devil incarnate for the conservative base. But Obama was lucky that Russia didn't deploy all their evil plans to give the presidency to his opponent and now we are dealing with not only a deranged GOP but a hostile foreign interference to tilt our elections.
