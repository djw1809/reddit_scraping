Depressive Dope?

Hello fellow Reddit-ers or fellow stoners so I've been smoking pot on and off since I was 17 or so and the past few months I've been buying pot off a new guy. Before this guy I had only bought pot once through an old connection but my experience with weed has mainly been through social smoke sessions with friends and co-workers. So I don't have a good handle on different strains all I know is I've been buying pretty good weed off this guy for a while but his latest batch smells a tad minty? And stale? And I find that it makes me and my girlfriend a good bit depressed. What type of weed might this be?",Misanthrop93,e4tjpsz,trees

"I kind of just stumbled upon this while I was looking for something else...

Wow. We are a lot closer than I thought we were. I just randomly picked Texas, since I live in Oregon and I know where all my elected officials stand. We've got Republican dudes in Texas who are at least a little friendly.

It's just like I thought: Republicans' main concern is that it remains a State issue and not Federal. I believe it can be both. As of 11/7/2018, 33 states already support some kind of legal weed. Of the ones that are left, I think Texas, Wisconsin, Indiana and North Carolina would pass legislation if it is on the ballot in 2020. But I don't think we need to wait that long. I don't know what 's pending in Congress, but if there's nothing, or there's too much in it that it may not be broadly backed, I think I have a good solution...

Here's some legislation that I think pretty much everyone could get behind: Legalizing at the Federal level (but the Federal level only) the production, use, distribution, etc. (however it's broadly worded in states were rec is legal.) Why on ""the Federal level only""? That's the hook: The key will be to target members of Congress who are fine with things on a state level, but don't like the idea of legalizing on a Federal level. It would basically be saying ""The United States Government officially recognizes the legality of weed in the individual states that have approved it."" The implication would be, and the message that conservative Republicans could take back to their constituents would be ""Look, it doesn't effect anything in Our Great State. If you don't want Marijuana to be legal here, vote against it \[on the state level.\] This is something that each state has to decide for itself.""

Another idea would be to target states and Congressional districts where the Opioid Epidemic is really raging. Not sure how that would work out, but it has to be worth looking into...

Finally, 

I actually had another idea, but I lost it, and this one replaced it: As long as we have President Cheeto ($#!+ now I want some Cheetos,) I think it could be pitched to him, as long as it was done the right way: The biggest tax increase in United States history, but only for people willing to pay. \[let that sink in.\] It hits all the right buttons: Libertarians - Personal Choice, Democrats - Personal Choice (""...while not the choice that I, personally would make..."") Is Taxed, Conservative Christian Republicans - ""We will *punish* them by forcing them to pay more for their vices!"" It's typically taxed on a state level (though I'm not sure how that's really working out) and this might allow tax collection on a Federal level. But not if you don't want to.

Prohibition is a tool the state has used to terrorize the populace, to stigmatize the poor and minorities, and to wreck minority communities.

>More and more states are legalizing and Trump isn’t doing anything to stop it. 

Nor did Obama, his DOJ only raided the big violators, and he mostly did it to appease the right wing who is thirsty to use pot as a ""law and order"" issue. Though he had every opportunity to end MJ in the US, he still didn't. Trump however is very proactive in his goal to end legal pot, appointing a DOJ who shares his goal. Under Trump we in CO have seen raids of dispensaries and as of last week his DOJ is coming and destroying small grow ops on private land here. So much for those states rights? Thanks Trump!

You don’t know what circumstances bring people to using these types of drugs, so you really don’t have the place to judge, especially something you clearly have zero understanding of.

I am sure you don’t like being judged unfairly for being a stoned, so you shouldn’t judge people specifically because they use a drug. Most of these people started out with pain issues, their doctors prescribed them pain killers, then doctors were punished by the government for overprescribing, so opioids became impossible to get and unaffordable so they had to go to heroin because it is the only opioid they could afford.

This just hurts to hear you blindly judge people because I have a chronic debilitating illness and have had to use opioids for many years in many different forms. After I was taken off of my prescriptions, for a brief perioid all I could find was heroin too. It was actually way shittier of a drug than the painkillers, and you don’t have to inject it either, I didn’t.

Anyways I found Kratom and it was a much better safer and healthier alternative, but using heroin a few times when I had no other meds for my cfs/fibromyalgia, absolutely did not make me a different person. I still kept up my relationships with friends, nobody ever knew, and I kept advancing in my career. 

I am not saying everyone can do this, and I have always used my opioids responsibly for pain/anxiety relief. I am just saying you should judge people based on their actions not on what chemical they put in their body. Their are horrible shitty people who put heroin in their bodies, but their are also horrible shitty people who put THc in their bodies. Judge people for how they act, nobody deserves to be judged for smoking pot or doing literally anything in their own privacy in a manner that doesn’t harm, bother, or put themselves or /anyone else in danger.

How many of the ""larger municipalities"" are going to opt out of allowing recreational sales?

I know nothing of Michigan and as such don't know where it is going to be band. Mostly curious, because I knew where it was going to be band in Oregon. I just like looking up areas and seeing similar trends in terms of population centers, voting tendencies, ages in those regions, etc.

"My point is you cannot say ""They are fuckwits"" without looking at similar incidents in the past.

Else it's just a random, worthless opinion without anything to back it up at all.

And the only things you have to back it up are other examples of ""Politicians who speak out against public sentiment"" and ""Public acceptance of drugs"".

And in those cases, there has been proof that sometimes politicians who speak out against public sentiment __were__ actually in the right for doing so and that public acceptance of drugs is continually changing.

So no, even right now they are not definitely any more of a fuckwit than politicians who went against public sentiment who said ""Actually, it might be okay for gay people to marry, y'know..."".

We already have proof that even when people went against public sentiment, they may not have been fuckwits right then when they did it, and may have been forward thinkers instead.

"My stoner/fast food story:

My very first day of community college, I had a class where I sat next to Bill Murray. Not the actor Bill Murray, just some dude named Bill Murray. He was really nice and he was super funny. We had to pair up for some day 1 “get to know your classmate” kind of activity, so he and I paired up and got nothing done because we were both laughing so hard. 

As we left class, he asked me for a ride home. His place was literally about two minutes out of my way, so I was more than happy to help him out. When we got to his place pace, he started telling me that he didn’t have any cash and he felt rotten about not being able to pay me for the ride. Again, I told him that it was fine, but then he said “Hold up, I got something for you!” He handed me a joint and said “See you Thursday, bro!” And he hopped out of the car.

I had never smoked before. I previously had no idea where to even get weed, so this was like God reaches down from the heavens, through his chosen stoner, and gave me the gift of green. I went straight home and smoked the entire thing. Right when that shit kicked in, Sheryl Crow’s “Steve McQueen” video came on the TV, and it was a fucking religious experience for me. The music, the cars, the sexy milf body, the guitar, the milf, more milf, sexy sexy milf milf, Sheryl Crow please marry me I love you and I want to have your babies.

The next morning, I stopped by a Jack in the Box for some breakfast on my way to class. Who handed me my order at the drive through? BILL FUCKING MURRAY. He handed it off and said “Don’t worry, sir. I made sure you got your hashbrowns in there.”

I pulled away from the drive through and looked in the bag. Dude had hooked me up with eight hashbrowns. I ordered one.

I’m not sure if it’s the same in the states but in the UK they have to put bouncers/security on the doors of fast food places in city centres or busy spots because drunk people just always kick off and cause problems.

At mine the counter goes to red at around 80 seconds and they think it's unacceptable to have an average wait of over 120 seconds. Yet there's not much you can do when your average customer count just in drive thru is 300+ in the 2 or 3 hours during a lunch rush and most of the people take over 60 seconds just to get the order out of their mouths only to ask for more sauce or food at the window.",KawaiSenpai,ebcy9lf,trees
"It's tough to get stock levels right, especially for a store that closes up at night.

Let's say Subway meatballs are flash Frozen in a bag, which gets dropped in a large Steel box full of boiling water. That must cook for one hour. Now each bag has maybe 32 balls? So I have half a bag still on, and it's around 730 and we are gonna be closed in an hour and it's a weekday and we're slow. I'm probably not going to drop another bag of 32 meatballs if I have 16 still left and no customers, and it won't be ready and safe for consumption for a full hour. Then all of a sudden you get a mom who has 3 kids who only eat meatballs. Boom, sold out of meatballs and by the time the new ones would be ready, the store is closed. I know if you plan on getting meatballs around that time, you could call to indicate this so they would be more likely to have meatballs on through till closing? But for the most part, they are probably thinking ""these are gonna get thrown out, and have a Max sales life of 30 minutes before closing. Not worth the shrink and lost profit, especially since we only have two more bags back there. More likely to sell them in the day time/afternoon than the last hour of the day.

Mainly, there are a whole lot of factors that go into keeping some sort of food service place stocked with all the options. I'm extremely good at my job, which is keeping it stocked, and some times you just run into issues. Delivery issues, supply issues, demand issues, loss of equipment, etc. I also will always offer something free or discounted to make up for it because I know if I came in with my mind made up on meatballs and then had to change it up, I'd be disappointed for sure...

Basically the world (especially retail) would be a better place if customers and associates could all just feel a little empathy towards one another. 

Edit: to clarify, I don't work at Subway, just another food service establishment, and also don't get me wrong, a lot of the times you are dealing with a 17 year old who literally could care less and nothing will come of the mistakes they make.. ",nm1043,ebczqsv,trees

***rant***

I had to take and make all customer orders, ensure that coffee was made every 15 mins, and stock and clean *literally* *everything*. All the cups and sugars and straws were always empty for me to fill, I had to clean doughnut cases, fridges, cupboards. I also had to prep all the sandwich ingredients, and ensure all the baked goods were in their proper places which involved cleaning all the racks, lining them with paper, and filling with baked goods. I was required to make sure the dining area - which was also open all night - was clean and I had to do all the dishes left over from the last shift. Speaking of the previous shift, they would always leave everything a mess so before I could even get to my job I had to do *their* dishes, they always left the dining room a pigsty and the counters unwiped. I never got any help, and the first person who came in every morning always bitched at me about at least 3 things. And rather than do it herself she forced me to do it, even if I was busy.

One of the managers pulled me aside one day and told me I was doing an unsatisfactory job. She mentioned how long it took me to get people through drive-thru. People would get like 3 sandwiches, 2 soups, 2 bagles with cream cheese, 4 specialty drinks and doughnuts. And I'm the only one making orders cause the baker wasn't trained for the front.

For example, my local lookout gets complete destroyed by kids getting high. They spray paint and litter every where. 

Another example, a guy I know, who is a huge rager, would intentionally make fucked up orders so if they fucked it up, he would sit there and bitch till he got another sandwich and something else for free. And he would do that after he ate half the sandwich.

I mean, sometimes stoners can be self entitled little shits, who are covering up their shitty life by getting high all the time.

"There was recently a civic association meeting in my neighborhood to vote on a proposed location for a recreational weed store. This was not a legally binding vote or a referendum on the legality of cannabis, because the issue was put to a vote and the people of my state overwhelmingly voted in favor of legalization, and it was repeatedly stressed that discussion was to be kept to whether or not we supported the proposed location, and not about our personal feelings on weed. Based on the results of the vote the civic association would draft a letter either supporting or opposing the opening of the store in that location.

In spite of all that, a huge number of old Vietnamese members could not refrain from ranting about how people would die because of weed and drugs are bad and so on. Old Vietnamese people are apparently super conservative and *hate* weed. Practically everyone else was in favor, but we were outnumbered.

Since we're on the topic of this packaging, this isn't the best parody I've seen, but it's far from the worst. He put in as many subtle jokes as he could and even did some play-on words with ""XXXtracts."" I think it would've been better if the same joke didn't repeat as often though. 420 appears 3 times... This could've easily been solved by simply using 710, since 710 = OIL. (Flip the word OIL and it looks like the number 710.)

But I also though, ""hmm, I've seen this a million times and done better."" Anyone can make a pun on an existing brand or slogan; is that necessarily more or less creative than creating a complete brand identity from scratch? 

As for Weird Al, I love him, I think he's a genius...but is it really a huge creative stretch to turn ""Beat It"" into ""Eat It""? I'd argue that was low-hanging fruit, creatively speaking. Much like I see this packaging: it's a good chuckle but it's not reinventing the wheel by any means.

"**Korean War**

The Korean War (in South Korean Hangul: 한국전쟁; Hanja: 韓國戰爭; RR: Hanguk Jeonjaeng, ""Korean War""; in North Korean Chosŏn'gŭl: 조국해방전쟁; Hancha: 祖國解放戰爭; MR: Choguk haebang chŏnjaeng, ""Fatherland: Liberation War""; 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953) was a war between North Korea (with the support of China and the Soviet Union) and South Korea (with the principal support of the United States). The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea following a series of clashes along the border.As a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea had been split into two sovereign states. Both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces—supported by the Soviet Union and China—moved into the south on 25 June 1950.

When I roll spliffs, I always add cloves. I'm generally not a fan of tobacco smoke's taste, but it's really enjoyable with clove. I'll even roll cloves into straight joints for the flavor, too.

"**Cupressus sempervirens**

Cupressus sempervirens, the Mediterranean cypress (also known as Italian cypress, Tuscan cypress, Persian cypress, or pencil pine), is a species of cypress native to the eastern Mediterranean region, in northeast Libya, southern Albania, southern coastal Croatia (Dalmatia), southern Montenegro, southern Greece, southern Turkey, Cyprus, northern Egypt, western Syria, Lebanon, Malta, Italy, Israel, western Jordan, and also a disjunct population in Iran.Cupressus sempervirens is a medium-sized coniferous evergreen tree to 35 m (115 ft) tall, with a conic crown with level branches and variably loosely hanging branchlets. It is very long-lived, with some trees reported to be over 1,000 years old.

The foliage grows in dense sprays, dark green in colour. The leaves are scale-like, 2–5 mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots.

"One of my first Reddit posts was shared here about a month ago regarding the [Shafer Commission ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafer_Commission) and it was mostly downvoted lol. 

But that report was issued by a commission that Nixon himself appointed shortly after marijuana was categorized as a Schedule I drug in 1970. 
He hoped that his majority Republican commission would side with him and his belief that weed was “America’s public enemy number one” but the report suggested that “Marihuana” be reclassified and decriminalized because from their studies, more damage was being done by criminalizing users rather than educating and empowering them. 

Nixon tried to conceal the report and encouraged the chairman not to publish it, but they persisted and revealed the information to Americans in 1972, sooo Nixon just ignored it and continued forward with the “war on drugs” shortly after with the creation of the DEA.

This first report was published in March of 1972.

I don’t know for certain, but it seems to me that after the report was made public, the White House scrambled to put out media that denounced marijuana usage in an effort to cover up the findings of the report.

"There’s this myth that several musicians that are part of the 27 club (musicians and artists who all died at the age of 27) died with a white bic lighter on their person. It’s apparently big in stoner culture but I only ever heard of it once—the myth has also been discredited by snopes, as bic had not been selling or even producing disposable white lighters until a couple years after some of the members of this 27 club had already died (Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison were some of the major ones that the myth is attributed to, but they were all deceased by 1971, iirc, and I believe the white lighters came about around ‘73)

I still would prefer my local craft beer over some light beer any day. Similarly with weed, I love browsing my local pot store to find what awesome choices and selections are offered. I might not buy Marlboro brand weed, but I won’t avoid it “just because”.  I understand big tobacco has had their hands in money and politics, but they are getting involved, why punish them for that?

"While I’m pretty skeptical about Big Tobacco being involved with cannabis, I would caution you all that this is not the same thing as other big businesses being involved in cannabis.

I worked for a biotech in an illegal state doing highly restricted research on cannabis well before the current legalization trend began. I know full well that big tobacco will likely fuck up the industry for everyone but themselves if we let them in. That’s not to say that we can’t benefit from big businesses being involved with the legalization trend, especially biotech companies (for those who are worried this means big pharma, they are totally different).  

We have strains like charlottes web and even more refined forms for various medicinal and recreational uses because biotechs like the one I worked at did the necessary research. It would have taken the growers who worked in tandem with researchers to create it *hundreds of generations* to reach the levels they were able to, and *thousands* to reach what can be achieved now. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love to support local industry. Right now I’m wearing a hat made in a factory in my city, a shirt made in my parents home town, and drinking a beer brewed next to my house. Unfortunately, the boutique model of cannabis sales is hugely inefficient and nun more expensive for the end users, and I have yet to see a projection of it being sufficient on its own to supply all the needs of the nation under full legalization. We will need some larger chain stores as well to keep it accessible and affordable for recreational users and patients alike.

ETA: I see a lot of comments on here from people saying that they will buy the products as long as they are affordable.

It's like appealing to the masses to stop listening to upcycled mainstream music, it will never happen because it sounds pleasant and familiar, while also being backed by huge funding making it readily available. The same will be true of big cannabis. Which sucks but in order to change this we would need to change fundamental mechanics of western society, a pretty big job to say the least.

I'm certainly going to boycott, in some countries you can get in more trouble for growing tobacco than you can for cannabis, no doubt that is because of the political influence of big tobacco and absolutely no doubt once cannabis becomes their main revenue generator they will pull all the same shady shit to try and ""protect that asset"" such as making it illegal for people to grow their own cannabis.

now i walk into my local dispensary and the only 10$ weed is super weak shit. they have buds that sell for upwards of 17$ ffs. and thats grass-roots business men buying from the same suppliers as the ""illegal"" guys get their (ten dollar a gram) weed from. big tobacco is just going to be worse. get ready for 25$ grams kiddies.

Now, if it's the equivalent of skunk weed or some weird bullshit, then sure. But also not everyone wants 25% thc, just like not everyone wants a 9% IPA.

But they're catching on to what's good. Look at how big beer is stepping things up and offering cheaper alternatives to grossly overpriced craft beer. I can get a six pack of good Belgian beer for $8 when the competition is sitting around $14.

And even if really pro-weed states mandated that weed has to be local themselves, other states would just go for the money route and let big industries into the game anyways.

Don’t get me wrong, I would love to see pot being a local community business... but it is likely going to be similar to farms in that big businesses will sell farm products cheaper than local businesses in most cases.  Mainly because the amount of capital big tobacco (think weed Walmart) already has (fucking massive farm land, efficient, outrageously expensive machinery, buyers and outlets in every state/country) AND already have employed labor to use it all. If they can make it cheaper, it’s going to become the popular alternative as long as the quality isn’t too bad.

Argument from fallacy is the formal fallacy of analyzing an argument and inferring that, since it contains a fallacy, its conclusion must be false. It is also called argument to logic  (argumentum ad logicam), the fallacy fallacy, the fallacist's fallacy, and the bad reasons fallacy.Fallacious arguments can arrive at true conclusions, so this is an informal fallacy of relevance.

This is a false choice fallacy. You’re suggesting that the only two options are Kellogg’s style or shady weed from dark alley ways. No one wants the shady alley weed. Some want the Kellogg’s style. But like others in this thread have suggested there will be a spectrum of options in the new market. The point of my post was more altruistic in that I personally am not going to support the Kellogg style backed by big tobacco for moral and political reasons. Do ad you see fit.

"There's over 7000 chemicals in cigarettes. That's the line from anti smoking groups.  Maybe there is, but guess what, 95% of them are naturally found in tobacco.  Like formaldehyde, the commercials always say is in cigarettes- guess what, it occurs naturally when organic substances are burned. Wood releases it. Marijuana releases it as well.  

Marlboro actually adds a total of 9 ingredients other than tobacco and water to their cigarettes. They're required to disclose them to the FDA, and they're publicly available on the PhilipMorris website. 

5 of those 9 ingredients are pure flavorings like cocoa extract and high fructose corn syrup. If anyone ever eats Taco Bell or drinks Mt. Dew (or nearly any other prepackaged food) then I don't see how you're getting upset over these.

2 of the others are propylene glycol and glycerol, which are used to keep the product moist and sweeten the flavor, and are also primary ingredients in vape liquids.  So if you've got no issues with vaping, hard to be mad at these.

The last 2 are amoniums which are flavorings and help the user absorb nicotine.  How insidious, they boosted nicotine absorption in their products! ....like consumers wanted.  

All of these ingredients were added because they were tested and consumers preferred them.  And given the current regulation of tobacco by the FDA, tobacco companies actually couldn't remove any of those ingredients if they wanted to.  The FDA strictly disallows changing the ingredients in any way. In fact PhilipMorris actuality went out and paid millions to buy an existing brand because it had a different ingredient mix. That was easier and cheaper for them than changing the current ingredients in an existing brand.

There are cigarettes on the market without the added ingredients, like Native American Spirits. And many consumers prefer them. Imagine that, differing products for differing consumer tastes. But I'll let you in on a secret, those will kill you just as fast as Marlboros will.

So yeah, cigarettes have added chemicals, just like nearly every other thing we put in our bodies these days. It's not any more insidious than a bag of Doritos. ""But cigarettes are different because they cause cancer, Doritos don't cause cancer!"" Well yeah, no shit, burning something an inhaling it is harmful.

" It's all about forward progress and with the market fresh and wide open, there is so much space for corporations to dive in. Imagine Nabisco, or Frito-Lays and companies like Pepsi offering CBD/THC infused products. Believe me as a cigarette smoker, I too had initial paranoia over the thought that big Tobacco would tamper too much with their product, but I have got on board lately with the idea of forward progress in the pot industry. Of course monitoring and strict regulations geared towards any company to keep their product safe and pure absolutely has to be in place; the same ones that apply to medical and current company products' available. A company like Marlboro (who, let's be honest are the king of cigarette manufacturers) must ponder the idea that stepping into the marijuana industry, as it is just the next natural step; It makes too much sense. They have the packaging perfected and the process of getting 20 perfectly consistent, rolled cigarrettes into a package. This applies to the other companies as well. As people are getting smarter about the dangers of tobacco, and with the help of astronomical prices- the tobacco industry is slowly dying. This could be potentially what both industries really need. A saving grace, and a rejuvination into a brave new world.

There is a calculator on Health Canada's [website](http://health.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drug-health-products/buying-using-drug-health-products-safely/cannabis-medical-purposes/accessing-cannabis-medical-purposes/production-cannabis-medical-purposes/calculator.html) that shows how many plants patient's are allowed to cultivate, and how much dried cannabis they are allowed to store.

The only difference is commies are motivated by power handed to the state, capitalists are motivated by the power coming from wealthy and prosperity. Communism is the failure, because human nature cannot allow it. Man is inherently greedy. There cannot ever be social equality, because plain and simple, some people are more valuable than others.

"I can’t see how that math would add up.  From my experience, you would need 1 clone, 1 veg plant, and 1 flower plant growing at the same time.  Clone stage is 14-21 days, veg is 21-42 days (for most indoor perpetual harvest cultivations) unless you were trying for multiple lbs per flower plant, in that case veg would run from 70-100 days, and standard flower stage is 56-63 days. If you were to try and flower 2 plants at the same time you couldn’t cut any new clones until harvest, which would add 14-21 days to you next harvest.  Your average per plant yield (35 day veg) is going to be between 3-4oz.

I can go into greater detail if you’d like, but I think that you can see how this wouldn’t work.  In a commercial setting from the day I cut a clone until the day I harvest that clone as a fully flowered plant is between 118-125 days.

Man... Now that I think about it the biggest problem is Sin Taxes. If cigarettes weren't taxed like they are they would be like $10 a carton. I could easily see pot being maybe twice that which is still super cheap. But with taxes who the fuck knows. The illegal scene may just stay a big thing if taxes are insane. 

BTW I'm not anti-tax, but when they double the price of the product then that's fucking insane. When they're so big that the illegal market actually *increases* then that's a fucking problem. We're letting the richest companies pay next to nothing and taxing the things the regular citizens enjoy at obscene rates to make up the difference, it's goddamn criminal.",electricblues42,ebcihre,trees

"Besides the fact that while combustion might eventually become a thing of the past it still is very much a thing of the present (at least in europe), you're assuming that homegrown weed is necessarily worse than what you'd get in a weed store, which simply isn't true:
A good indoor grow is just as good as what the pro growers sell because it's the exact same thing!

Obviously, the lazy ones won't put in that much work, unless they're doing it for the fun of growing their very own weed. So, let's assume that only 10% of entkind are having that dream and only 10% of those will actually go through with it, once it becomes legal. I believe that the rate is actually higher on both conditions but it doesn't matter: If ""only"" 1% of entkind grow their own weed, that's still a shitload of weed growing ents in absolute numbers!

And then there's also something called ""outdoor growing"", which in it's most basic form describes the process of planting a bunch of seeds and harvesting the finished plants a couple of months later. Of course, with this method you are depending on weather and seasons and in most cases and the resulting weed is usually (but not necessarily if you're lucky with the weather!) worse than indoor grows. However, it's pretty much free weed! You don't have to buy anything except the seeds, you have no running costs (i.e. electricity), you have almost no work to do (you might have to water your plants from time to time but that's ALL you have to do between planting and harvest!) and in the absolute worst case, you end up with just a mediocre amount of sub-standard weed. Which in my opinion is still a definite win considering you put almost no effort and money into your growing operation! =)

tl;dr: While growing top-notch buds may be a science, growing cannabis is very easy. You can't compare letting a weed grow to producing alcohol. You can't just put some beer seeds into your garden and wait for your beers to grow but you CAN get some decent cannabis exactly like that. :)",thisismalvar,ebeu5vg,trees

>  I'm not sure standing in front of the bulldozers will be as effective as supporting politicians that want to make it illegal to bulldoze forests

I completely agree with you here, and the whole thing has me pondering the power that large corporations and SuperPACs have when influencing who gets elected. (This is similar to the above case, where we have a giant entity funding an idea/politician that **THEY** want, and with a well informed public can be combated through voting at the ballot box)

The cynical side of me thinks that since '1 dollar = 1 vote', many politicians try to keep things like minimum wage low, to effectively limit the 'voting' power of citizens outside of election years.

On the other side, there seems to be some 'general recognition' that money influencing politics has gone too far. 

In New York, an initiative to allow ""small contributions to election campaigns to be matched 6:1, up to $175"" has been proposed, seemingly to give the power back to the people, and away from corporations and billionaires, who according to (https://blog.wetrust.io/democratic-donation-matching-626759e928) may in some cases be at risk of challenging the democratic pillar of “one person, one vote"".

"The whole case against him was really hinky. In relation to these charges, he was never arrested by the RCMP nor charged with any offense under Canadian law. He was unlawfully detained by American agents on Canadian soil then renditioned to the states to stand trial. He was not first arrested by Canadian police then transfered to US authorities, nor was there ever any formal extradition process. 

Emery was a political prisoner. Unlike other Canadian seed sellers who operated openly and legally at the time, Emery was singled out since he claimed to have used all profits from his seed business as a sort of legal fund for supporting the defence efforts of other cannabis activists, including Americans. 

I think that Emery messed up big time by selling his seeds to American customers. He would have been aware that such a seed business under US law would constitute ""conspiracy to manufacture marijuana"" since US federal law considers cannabis seeds an illegal narcotic. His mistake was believing that Canadian authorities would respect Canadian sovereignty and refuse to participate in any such arrest. 

Emery has been arrested and imprisoned in Canada countless times over the years on various different charges, but he was never arrested by Canadian police for trafficking seeds, since un-germinated seeds are not prohibited by the Criminal Code. ",FPS_Knifer,ebdquqn,trees

"If you really wanted to go all out you could see a glass blower about what they can do. otherwise Hi, Phil Swift here with Flex Tape! The super-strong waterproof tape! That can instantly patch, bond, seal, and repair! Flex tape is no ordinary tape; its triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly! Plus, Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas in water without draining them! Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers and RVs! Flex Tape is super strong, and once it's on, it holds on tight! And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions! Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holes. To show the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape! Not only does Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal, so the inside is completly dry! Yee-doggy! Just cut, peel, stick and seal!

Second off, might want to get a case for your glass or rethink placement of the larger, more expensive items. The shelves look sturdy but an earthquake spells doom for the larger pieces of the top shelf.

Get some local glass! There are alot of glassblowers out there. Your not going to be able to mark it up 100% like the stuff made in China but having quality local art goes a long way.

"Your store needs to be an extension of your brands message. Your selling your message just as much as your product.

For example, when a new built home goes on the market, real estate agents fill the house with high end, swanky furniture, a cookbook flipped to a fancy recipe on the counter, an old globe in the corner, fancy wine in the fridge and golf on the tv. This can add significant value to the home because they're selling the lifestyle as well as the home.

"So we’ve been quite a few times between us and we like walking around. There are many many different types. We finished in an underground one last night with a Mexican vibe, strong strains, nice place. Trippy paintings on the walls. Some are more bar types. Some will have only sofas and bean bags and vapes to use. It’s a nice variety. 

In Rotterdam now, at the Canna Club. Downstairs was very professional, clean counters and jars for the selection clearly shown. Great Christmas decorations, staff in uniform... currently upstairs where it’s decorated like a restaurant, very clean, nice music again. We’re in the corner with some flashy velvet stools and cute table. 

Almost all of these places have free roaches and rizzla at most table. And you have to buy a drink to sit and use the smoking area. Considering you’ll want a drink to do something they are letting you do even in an illegal country. Small price to pay. 
Some will give you a Bong to use if you ask for it. And not all allow the use of tobacco inside if you mix. But if you do they provide a herb substitute on each table to mix in. I just aim for allowed ones, personal habit. 

There’s quite a lot of etiquette and things to know. But if you’re nice to the staff and be nice to the locals you’ll have a great time. ",xx420Dxx,ebdj35a,trees

Invest in a good dehumidifier for flower and drying stages. Last week flush water. Leave in dark place for 1 week before chop, good genetics are key, people way over think this stuff is literally called weed cuz it grows like one. Any sign of bugs or fungus get some doctor earth products for either it’s even recommended by the state of Oregon for pest and fungus problems, spider mites aren’t the end, just stop open the grow as much and spray at any sign of those ior fungus if you want to slavge it’s essential oils so just try to not spray 3 week before harvest.

Will be more honest than that actually. Few months ago I got into ectasy, got slightly addictive. That made my weight loss worse but my issues started months before so I know it was the cause of things. Then a few weeks ago for some stupid reason I decided to try lsd.

"Very true. I used to sell meth and cocaine and one time we got pulled over because my dealer (who was driving) didn't have a license plate on her car and the cops looked right at my buddy's meth pipe in the side door with his torch right next to it and they did nothing; the cop just pretended she didn't see anything. Another time I was picking another friend up at night in an empty parking lot as just as he reupped on meth and was stepping in the car a DEA SUV and multiple cop cars pulled in. The cops took my friend for an hour or two let my friend go without any charges if he took them to his dealer - my friend gave up the big dealer and no charges were pressed. Turns out the DEA was just making normal rounds and they found it abnormal that I was sitting in my car in an empty lot while all the stores were closed; they thought I was gonna rob a store or something. The funny thing about the second story is that we had already picked up from the dealer and was driving back when my friend realized that he gave the dealer ALL of his money, not just the money to pay for his meth. It was when we drove back to get my friend's money that the DEA found us. If my friend had not been so twacked out he wouldn't have given the dealer all of his money lol.

I throw a lb of butter and about a cup or so of water in a small crockpot with whatever ABV/stems/extract/shake I'm gonna use, set it on low and leave it for about 24 hours stirring every once in awhile and adding water if necessary. It probably only needs 12-16 hours but I tend to do this in the evenings so I don't get back to it until almost 24 hours later. Then pour it out of the crockpot through some cheesecloth to strain out the plant matter and into a glass bowl. Squeeze the cheesecloth to make sure you don't miss out on any butter. Cover it and stick it in the fridge overnight. The water will stay on the bottom while the butter rises to the top and solidifies. Then you pull the butter out of the glass container, discard the water, and put the butter in a airtight container and refrigerate.  

I usually go with 1/2 weed butter and 1/2 regular butter when I'm making edibles. I like to be able to eat a couple brownies or cookies or whatever without getting too high. ",arfnargle,ebbq8hs,trees

There's over 1,000 licensed grow operations in the state (growing *for sale*, not people growing for personal use). We're destroying roughly 15,000 pounds a month because we just can't sell it all. The only way you even can sell most of this shit anymore is at prices like this.

For those wondering, there's so many farms because the governing bodies in Oregon never set a limit to the number of licenses they would give out. And the reason we're destroying so much is because the law requires unsold product to be retested after 12 months, which costs money nobody wants to pay. So we're destroying 15k pounds a month worth of weed that's already been on the market for a year. And we legally can't sell it or move it past state lines, soooo...

Propylene glycol is approved by the FDA in nebulizers so I'm pretty sure it's safe but it does bring down the THC concentration.

"Ofcourse you need some talent to make music, the problem is that there are artists with even more talent. These are artists with more passion for music.

But I personally think the reason what's popular is popular is because of how accessible it is. In every genre there's better artists than in mainstream music, but the problem is the fact they're not pop and most people are completely unfamiliar with any other genre (which is fine, not everyone has time or wants to spend time listening to a lot of music).

If everyone got their wish, you'd get an ambient song followed by some death metal followed by drum and bass followed by a piece of classical music.

I think with any living thing you grow and will consume, proper vibrations will yield positive results. I will never forget the study conducted (*although the name escapes me*) where plants where placed in two separate rooms, 1 room had nothing but classical music played while the other room of plants (I forget the breed of plants but none were cannabis) had nothing but heavy metal or death metal played.  
  
After a set period of time, the plants were observed, the classical room had lively plants the death metal had wilted plants. So I think that alone says a lot about how you have to give the Right type of vibes towards living objects.  
  
Now I could go full weed head and even suggest that since living objects (animate) and non living objects (inanimate) are all made of the same base *thing* (atoms) that everything takes in or puts out vibes and bad vibes kills plants - but what would mechanical vibes due to plants?

"As another e-commerce company owner in the cannabis industry, what hurts the most are charge backs and PayPal complaints. Reporting social media accounts as well. Govt agencies are not going to do anything over a few complaints and the BBB literally does nothing. 

What I would do is call your credit card company and explain the entire situation. Tell them you want to do a charge back. Considering the story they should have no problem doing it. Then 420life needs to explain themselves to the bank in order to keep your money. They’ll either decide it’s not worth it and give the money back or will have to justify their product to the bank with the risk of being banned from their credit card processing. No credit card processing means no more selling. 

Sorry you had to deal with such a shit company!

Your insurance may not pay any claim where drug paraphernalia started a fire, faulty or not. They will hide behind federal statutes that still criminalize marijuana, and insurance doesn’t cover you when damage occurs from an illegal act. 

You would want to look for the UL mark. You may even want to contact UL to report such a device failing by using you as contact to ground. If there really are other grounding issues UL may revoke the device or components certificate which can prohibit components made overseas from being imported.

When we responded like most of us do we use our cell phone or cell phone has an AI, the AI does not know the difference between the spelling boy or BOi.

So in the reply get turn to BOA into BOY and he ran with it after which he was told he needs to buy a new coil that’s what all the threats came out I have 1.2 million followers you’re going to find out I’m gonna make you regret this I’m going to take down your company and is pretty much all he said he’s a little boy but we’re going to crush them legally we’re going to get them for defamation of character and sees all his assets no matter what state he stays in in the United States his bank account will be altered.

I complained to them that the incorrect temperature display is a safety hazard and asked for a way to disable the software, but it's China so they ignored all communications.

I really should put a video demo of how fake the software controller is up on YT. 

Basically if you let it heat up and then come over with a torch, it'll take almost 200 f of heat to make the display change from the target temp, and then when it updates it's WAY hotter than it was moments ago. Same thing on the cool-down. There's a ~200 f gap where it just jumps down to the target temp as it gets close.",joanzen,ebatz73,trees

"Its not just UL. There are lots of certified testing companies, like TUV, Intertek, etc... UL is just the most well known.

Also a stamp from them is often meaningless these days, lots of overseas manufacturing just forges it. If you really care, you need to get the certification number for the product and then go search the appropriate test lab database (all the good test labs have publicly searchable databases online) for that cert and check that it's real.


If it claims FCC compliance, that's also often bunk for overseas manufacturing. Go look up the FCC ID on the FCC's website, and see if it checks out. If they don't have an FCC ID and claim it was tested to comply at whatever other lab, well, the FCC doesn't care, and it can still impose fines on the seller and/or manufacturer (and in very rare cases, mainly when interfering over a large area with legitimate radio traffic, fine the user).

If the product is still recent, call your bank - explain to them kindly that you are trying return/replace a defective product you purchased from a business.

The bank is on your side, they will immediately issue a chargeback and the money will be returned to your account (regardless of the status of the product itself, they won't ask to see it).   Once a chargeback process has started, the store's business owner will have 14 days to respond to his bank explaining his situation and why he is refusing a refund.   If your bank isn't satisfied with his answer, or if he doesn't bother to respond within 14 days, the case is ruled in your favor and you get the money from your original order back.

To smoke this oil you get a bong that has a titanium “nail” (or a glass or quartz nail) in place of the bowlpiece. 

You heat up the nail with a blowtorch and then put on a little dab of your oil and inhale - you’ve just taken a dab!

Now an enail is a nail that has a chord attached to a main box (used for adjusting temperature settings) which is plugged into the wall and will hold your nail at whatever temp you want, so you effectively skip the heating nail w/ blowtorch step, and you can take a dab whenever you please.

I mean, you're closer than everyone else in the thread. But no.

UL is a private firm, and nothing is required to have a UL mark. 

OP wants the government agency: the **Consumer Product Safety Commission.**

www.cpsc.gov

Edit for clarity re: ""nothing is required to have a UL mark""-- I meant to write ""the government doesn't require a UL mark on consumer products like this, and if the product doesn't have a UL mark, UL isn't going to care.""

UL is a third party group, kinda so industry can ""police itself."" Generally, I would think that's BS, but it actually works pretty well and somewhat fairly, because *resellers* frequently require the UL mark. So if you want your product in Home Depot, they won't talk to you unless you're UL listed. (Or ETL. There is market competition here but it's limited.)

Your local vape shop or whatever probably doesn't have such scruples, which is probably OK most of the time, except when a shit company sells a shit product.

The CPSC is the government agency responsible for, well, ensuring the safety of consumer products. They can issue binding recalls. They are the ones to contact in a situation like this.

Comcast set up autopay without my permission and did not cancel it when requested after moving out (I even gave them 6 weeks advanced notice to cancel on a specific date).   Their system autocharged my card one weekend after moving causing me to accrue several hundred dollars in overdraft fees until I noticed the issue monday morning.   I went to the BBB and filed a complaint. 

Within several days I had someone from the corporate office of Comcast calling me to ask for a copy of relevant bank statements showing the charge and overdraft charges.

"That is actually correct though, no matter who manufactured the product the ""CE"" logo is just a stamp by the manufacturer self-certifying that their product meets the necessary standards to be sold in Europe. That's equally the case whether it was made in China or anywhere else.

The difference in spacing in the logo is probably just down to default chinese fonts/letter spacing settings.

All that having the ""wrong"" spacing in the CE mark is going to show you is that the manufacturer has poor attention to detail - which is a bad sign generally - but no more than that.

It's a big difference to the ""listing"" logos on US products, e.g. UL, intertek, that indicate the product has been tested and approved by a 3rd party. CE logos never indicate that the product has been tested and approved, only that the manufacturer believes that the design is compliant.

# Witch Hunt graphic breakdown and ""debunk"":

**TL;DR** \- *This guy seems to have a fairly erratic social media presence with posts representing opinions all over the political spectrum. Doesn't seem to be purely right wing or left wing as the hit piece above tries to present.*

**In reference to the ""only shoutout = MAGA racist"":**

I actually can't see anything ""MAGA"" or racist on [this guy's profile](https://www.instagram.com/jewishlungs/), literally just looks like a teenager who smokes weed and shitposts about it on Instagram. If we're going with the classic ""Pepe is racist"" line, I'd agree that Pepe can be used in a racist context if it is photoshopped to look like a klan member or alongside some racist caption but there is nothing inherently racist about a cartoon frog, I'm sorry.

**In reference to the RT-ing pro-genecide (sic) memes (Trail of Tears):**

I'm going to assume you didn't actually read any [news stories about the ruling being referenced in the Tweet](https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/judge-naomi-reice-buchwald-rules-trump-cant-block-twitter-users.html). With this context, the tweet essentially reads as ""Dear Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, Thank you for your ruling (that President Trump cannot block people on Twitter as it's a violation of their First Ammendment rights). Now try to enforce it."". I'd also love to know what's pro-genocide about this statement. I don't agree with the sentiment behind it, it definitely comes off as aggressive.

As /u/Chavaon pointed out, there are [several anti-Trump tweets](https://mobile.twitter.com/710Life/status/1009905914189471744) which are [very anti-border separation](https://mobile.twitter.com/710Life/status/1009309516855312384). Interestingly in that first one, they remind Donald Trump that he is a white man and that this land used to belong to the Native Americans, which doesn't sound like something a white supremacist would be saying in all caps.

**Finally in reference to the OP:**

If the anecdote in the title can be backed up with evidence of the correspondences, I'm more than happy to concede that the owner of this page is antisemitic. It's interesting people are overlooking [posts like this](https://mobile.twitter.com/710Life/status/969703097709813761) where he shares a disabled black man's Go Fund Me to help him get dental care in favour of more politically charged posts which don't agree with the mainstream left opinion.

While this person definitely seems to espouse some pro-Trump views on Twitter and definitely holds some animosity towards immigrants, they've also got anti-Trump, anti-border separation and pro-Native American tweets as well. To omit that fact and try and paint this person as a ""MAGA Racist"" absolutely comes close to what I would describe as a Witch Hunt when you have other people in the thread saying ""Can people make a bunch of posts about how they suck"" before we've even seen so much as a screenshot of anything explicitly racist.

**To OP if you're reading this;** I am not trying to minimise the horrendous experience you've had by saying extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I completely sympathise with you as I understand antisemitism is rife even in Western Society and so it isn't unbelievable you would be treated this way. Most of this is addressed to the people who are jumping on the bandwagon and hating on this guy for reasons not mentioned in the OP before actually looking into the situation for themselves.

"Edit: To clarify, none of this means the person running the social media accounts isn't a piece of shit, but it certainly debunks the idea that they are a Nazi or a White Supremacist.
# Witch Hunt graphic breakdown and ""debunk"":

**TL;DR** \- *This guy seems to have a fairly erratic social media presence with posts representing opinions all over the political spectrum. Doesn't seem to be purely right wing or left wing as the hit piece above tries to present.*

**In reference to the ""only shoutout = MAGA racist"":**

I actually can't see anything ""MAGA"" or racist on [this guy's profile](https://www.instagram.com/jewishlungs/), literally just looks like a teenager who smokes weed and shitposts about it on Instagram. If we're going with the classic ""Pepe is racist"" line, I'd agree that Pepe can be used in a racist context if it is photoshopped to look like a klan member or alongside some racist caption but there is nothing inherently racist about a cartoon frog, I'm sorry.

**In reference to the RT-ing pro-genecide (sic) memes (Trail of Tears):**

I'm going to assume you didn't actually read any [news stories about the ruling being referenced in the Tweet](https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/judge-naomi-reice-buchwald-rules-trump-cant-block-twitter-users.html). With this context, the tweet essentially reads as ""Dear Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, Thank you for your ruling (that President Trump cannot block people on Twitter as it's a violation of their First Ammendment rights). Now try to enforce it."". I'd also love to know what's pro-genocide about this statement. I don't agree with the sentiment behind it, it definitely comes off as aggressive.

As /u/Chavaon pointed out, there are [several anti-Trump tweets](https://mobile.twitter.com/710Life/status/1009905914189471744) which are [very anti-border separation](https://mobile.twitter.com/710Life/status/1009309516855312384). Interestingly in that first one, they remind Donald Trump that he is a white man and that this land used to belong to the Native Americans, which doesn't sound like something a white supremacist would be saying in all caps.

**Finally in reference to the OP:**

If the anecdote in the title can be backed up with evidence of the correspondences, I'm more than happy to concede that the owner of this page is antisemitic. It's interesting people are overlooking [posts like this](https://mobile.twitter.com/710Life/status/969703097709813761) where he shares a disabled black man's Go Fund Me to help him get dental care in favour of more politically charged posts which don't agree with the mainstream left opinion.

While this person definitely seems to espouse some pro-Trump views on Twitter and definitely holds some animosity towards immigrants, they've also got anti-Trump, anti-border separation and pro-Native American tweets as well. To omit that fact and try and paint this person as a ""MAGA Racist"" absolutely comes close to what I would describe as a Witch Hunt when you have other people in the thread saying ""Can people make a bunch of posts about how they suck"" before we've even seen so much as a screenshot of anything explicitly racist.

**To OP if you're reading this;** I am not trying to minimise the horrendous experience you've had by saying extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I completely sympathise with you as I understand antisemitism is rife even in Western Society and so it isn't unbelievable you would be treated this way. Most of this is addressed to the people who are jumping on the bandwagon and hating on this guy for reasons not mentioned in the OP before actually looking into the situation for themselves. The information I've provided above is by no means the full picture, but I feel like I've presented a more rounded argument than the MS Paint hit job I'm replying to.",Fuingo,eba9ii0,trees

"So 710 is another term for oil (710 upside down spells OIL) but theres a lot more to it

Copying and pasting my reply to another comment: 

So through a process called “blasting” you can strip the thc and pther canabannoids from weed and after a refinement process be left with what is called “oil” or BHO (butane hash oil - there are other methods of creating oil that don’t use butane but BHO is by far the most common)

To smoke this oil you get a bong that has a titanium “nail” (or a glass or quartz nail) in place of the bowlpiece. 

You heat up the nail with a blowtorch and then put on a little dab of your oil and inhale - you’ve just taken a dab!

Now an enail is a nail that has a chord attached to a main box (used for adjusting temperature settings) which is plugged into the wall and will hold your nail at whatever temp you want, so you effectively skip the heating nail w/ blowtorch step, and you can take a dab whenever you please.

"I used to work staff in a different state legislature, and it was always hilarious to answer a call like this, make a note for the representative, and then later overhear them have a call with a state agency that could be paraphrased as ""my constituent is having a problem with your folks. Sort it out or get bent.""

Given the way budget sessions/bills work, even one rep deciding ""yeah, fuck those guys - they're assholes, so let's not give them that funding they wanted"" can have a huge impact, particularly if they can get other members of their party on board for it, and the state agencies understand that far too well. In a less quid-pro-quo direction, it sometimes comes down to just the fact that the reps' offices and staffers are on the same telecom switchboard as the state agencies, and can completely sidestep the call centers/holding patterns to direct-dial someone who actually has the power to *make things happen* (often a boss' boss' boss' boss' boss of the people citizens usually interact with). Or they know them personally, and it becomes more of a ""hey, John, I got this constituent who's having some problems with a thing you guys do, can you get your people to check it out?"".

More people should call their state representatives/senators. Unfortunately, most of the calls we got were obviously people reading a script, folks who'd been auto-reconnected to our office, or that one fucking time some teacher running a civics class had all their students in each period blitz our phone lines from their cellphones to read the same prepared statement, but talking to and helping out actual people calling in with real problems was always a joy.",SomeOtherTroper,eb9xhi4,trees
"This is not actually the case, the fossil and genetic record show pretty widespread interbreeding with Neanderthal man, and Neanderthal's were significantly different looking than our cro-magnon ancestors. 

Secondly, for the entirety of human prehistory, most regions were pretty homogeneous when it came to the features we would eventually come to associate with 'race', so your neighbor that you fought and raided looked pretty much like you and were likely related at some point in the past. 

It wasn't until water travel became sophisticated that markedly different tribes had contact with each other. 

Again, if you read the study, you will find that conservative mindsets are almost always linked with a ""fear of lack of resources"", and it is **that fear** that is at the root of intertribal violence. 

When one tribe perceived a lack, that was when they began seeing ""enemies everywhere"" and used violence to secure the resources they felt they were missing. 

Interestingly enough, the 'fear of lack' isn't actually correlated with lack of resources most of the time, just the perception of it. 

So, basically, the root of tribalism was extended family units banding together for safety and resources, and when those resources got slim the nearest decently-off tribe became the 'alien other that must be fought'.

If feelings don’t matter, does it matter if someone assaults you if they do no permanent damage? No broken bones, just a few light bruises? It’s just a little pain, after all. 

How about this situation, found in JustNoMIL, where a woman had a stillbirth at 8 months pregnant and her mother-in-law went around telling people first, that she was never even pregnant and second, that the child was the result of cheating? Is that behaviour somehow not viciously antisocial because it’s just her feelings being hurt?

Mind you, it’s not that she should be able to sue her mother-in-law or have her arrested; but I definitely think that situation warrants a restraining order, if necessary. The law should support a reasonably orderly society.

"I can see the argument for it. It's a way to get kids to 'get their feet wet' in the political process, and I don't know how large the classes were, so it could have just been the kids who actually agreed with the statement themselves calling in.

But I did get tired of it after a while, and it was a bit weird to get calls from obviously young voices reading the same statement all day, so I started asking the kids ""hey, is your teacher having you guys do this as a class?"", and once I confirmed what was going on, I told one ""I'm happy you're getting involved in the political process, but could you please tell your teacher to kindly knock this off?""

The calls suddenly stopped.

That's not even the funniest one - I ended up running down a money trail for a group that was lobbying hard with kids handing out these really nice glossy-printed mini-magazines in legislators' offices. Turns out they were actually funded by a state agency for a completely different purpose, under terms that indicated they weren't supposed to be doing political activism, and definitely not using state dosh (and the kids they were dealing with) to lobby the state like that...

There was also that one bill for putting a mandatory minimum sentence for child porn on a per-image basis, but written in such a way that technically, a single frame of video would count as a separate image. So at ~24fps, you'd potentially be going away for over your natural lifespan for possessing a single second of kiddie porn video, and the full video would easily see you in chokey for the next millennium. That bill never made it into committee, let alone onto the floor, but that was probably more due to the legislative session being incredibly busy, rather than because I'd found an odd flaw in it. (And it could easily have been re-written/amended, if we'd had the time.) Some other hilarious unintended ""excuse me, is this actually what the bill's intended to do?"" stuff was found by our analysts in different bills, but those luckily got amended (sometimes at the last second).

State politics is fun, and it's much closer to the people than federal politics. The really crazy part is that ~95% of the stuff that made it into committees went up or down unanimously, but the news reporting was only about the 5% that caused (metaphorical) fights and went to near party-line votes.

"Yeah telling me I have no deep feelings for other people and know nothing of other countries comes across as a not-so-subtle ""fuck you"" to me

And no. That our ideology blinds us to our atrocities instead of being open and remorseful about them almost makes us *worse*. We flat out deny them, lie to our children about them, *glorify* them. Iraq war movies with American good guys, cowboys-and-Indians Westerns glossing over genocide, cop procedurals deifying constitutional violations, police departments bragging about ruining lives over petty possession on social media. 

And the government deliberately tries to hide much more: the CIA's involvement in countless coups; what did you learn about Allende and Pinochet in high school? Cause I learned nothing. The FBI's relentless and extrajudicial stalking and execution of countless black leaders and civil rights activists. In any other country we'd call that a secret police, but here it's just ""law enforcement""

But you're right: every Western power is a genocidal monster of a nation, we're not unique on that front.

*Americans*, much like Brits or Belgians or French or Turks or Canadians or any other people with genocidal colonial histories are not evil per se (I mean obviously I'm American and have a lot of friends and I don't think any of us are evil at the least) but just because *those governments claimed to have ""proper justification"" and ""good ideals"" does not make those governments good*

Besides all that, American ideals are garbage. Individualism to society's detriment, greed to the point of self destruction, ""liberty"" unless you're black or native or use drugs or live in a country with oil, ""the pursuit of happiness"" for the lucky few that can afford it.

"Hey!  Slightly off-topic, but, alongside CBD, I would recommend Kava for anxiety.  It's a completely non-addictive and very benign anxiolytic botanical that lifts the mood, loosens inhibitions, and lends a feeling of security and well-being to the user.  All this, and there are no cognitive effects - just mood!

r/kava for info, or pm me if you want a better overview.

And, as for Xanax, I've seen lives ruined, and I've seen lives restored.  It is a risk I would never personally take, but it can work for some people.

Also, your psychiatrist sounds like a quack.  Get a new one?",PristineResource,ebca8ng,trees
"Here’s my bit.

Long story short.

1year 25+mg daily Xanax 
600mg pregabalin daily
425mg Venlafaxine daily

The Xanax I was just addicted too. I take the other two still but not the Xanax anymore. 

I was a huge addict. Can’t remember 1 whole year of my life. Lost my business and nearly my wife. 

Quit cold turkey. 4 seizures. 6 weeks of cold sweats and puking. 3 months of involuntary violent muscle spasms. Arms, legs, hands, jaw - all flaying around. 

I nearly died. Ended up in A&E and they put me on Clonopin on a 0.5mg taper for 3 months. 

I’m clean now. Just smoke weed. I never drank alcohol anyway. 

Please stay clear of Xanax unless you really really REALLY need one and you are in a severe panic attack. I keep some bars broken up into 4 (0.5mg each piece) just for emergency’s. They work amazingly and you just want to feel like that all the time, so you keep popping them like candy and eventually your tolerance is sky high and you need 10mg just to get smashed. 

Crazy world. Lotta drugs.

But if you are, it behaves in most other ways just like olive oil or vegetable oil or coconut oil or any other cooking oil, except that it has a much higher smoke point (less danger of fire), and (for reasonas I don't know because my science-fu is weak) it is known to metabolize and pass through tissue membranes more quickly than other oils.

Just like they're added to nearly anything you put in or on your body nowadays. Ingredients that are added to cigarettes make them marginally more cancer causing than tobacco is in its natural state.

Well its the different methods in smoking and the different strains that interest me. The idea of having something I can use indoors that doesnt stink up the whole house is one. Another would finding out the different strains and knowing how the can affect me differently is pretty interesting. Before it was more of whatever I could get my hands on so having a selection of different types is kinda crazy to me. Is there anything I can read about them or is it more of a thing where I have to go off from experiencing first.,Junior31,ebdp90f,trees
"I remember when I first saw a video of someone taking a dap a few years ago.. I think they like fainted temporarily or something. It was kind of crazy just to watch something like that happen from weed. I remember the worst I've seen or even heard was just someone throwing up because they smoked 10+ blunts in one night.

&#x200B;

I may just start of something small like some people are suggesting.. Just to test the waters and go from there. I was a heavy smoker a long time ago but as I aged I just found my self smoking a few times a month and I dont feel like i've changed all that much in that regard. Its just something I like to do to relax and watch a movie or play some video games. So I feel like having something simple and convenient is something I would like.

&#x200B;

What Im really interested in besides the new methods is the different strains. That is something I really need and want to do some research on.  Do you know of any decent articles that I can read? ",Junior31,ebdpsp5,trees

the elements are extremely close to herb and the actual temperature can go much high than you want. i would recommend finding a friend who is heady and doesnt mind, and decarbing in an oven at his house. i have best luck doing 250 degrees for 27 minutes exactly on a silicone baking mat, not a metal tray. 

convection if possible. and remember if using a convection oven you need to play with the setting to acheive a real 250 degrees inside the over. most convection ovens will actually ramp temp down to compensate for cooking times with meat. so like my oven when set to 425 convection, will actually go to 400. so i would theoretically need to set it slightly high if i wanted it to be at 425.

"It took me a cpuple weeks for sure. One tip I can give you is to put the weed into the paper without the filter. You can roll the weed around and spread it equally first, and then add the filter.

"I was rolling perfect joints after only a couple tries but I was really into origami as a kid and that really helped with my ability to handle the paper. 

Dry weed is harder to roll but it can be done. If you can, try to roll it into a log. If you can't do that then you're going to have to roll it a little looser and maybe pack some in after. Either way you're basically going to want to ignore the weed and make a joint shape with the paper. Lots of people try to use the weed to guide the paper and it just doesn't work, no weed log is that strong. Also if you do that you're going to end up with a wrinkly joint and it's not going to be tight to the weed. Think about a cigarette, it's paper is completely smooth and that's how your paper should look.

Try practicing by rolling a joint with nothing in it but air. If you do that you will get what I mean by all of that. Also use a filter, it makes the process a lot easier, and do your best to roll a straight joint, rather than a cone. 

Once you get a full cylinder made with the paper you are golden, but that's hard to do without messing up your joint. I would recommend guiding it around the roach filter and use a toothpick, pocketknife, etc to get the bottom of the paper between the filter/weed and itself. 

Also yeah rolling mats suck. I only use them to keep my joints safe in my pocket. ",lvnglfe,ebdjx7g,trees

"Start low and go slow. The running joke among edibles is ""I don't feel it...I don't feel it...call an ambulance"".  


As previously mentioned, just have one. Wait up to two hours to see how you feel. Welcome to the world of cannabis, and as someone who has enjoyed the hobby for ten years, I hope you like it.  


Edibles are different than smoking cannabis, as edibles produce a 'body high' similar to being drunk and smoking often produces a 'head high' similar to feeling like dreaming. You may get dry eyes and dry mouth, but they are easily fixed. Also, time may begin to slow down and dilate. Many users enjoy this feeling!  


Remember to be around people and situations you like! Have good friends nearby, pet a dog (unless you're allergic. Then do not pet a dog), listen to a podcast, listen to music.  


Personally, I love the following things when I'm high. Maybe you will too!  


Podcasts: Welcome to Night Vale  


Music: Lots of 60's music, esp. Freebird and Comfortably Numb. When time slows down, these 7 minute songs feel like forever!  


Movies: Classic drop in, drop out movies. Examples include Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Boys and Girls Guide to Getting Down and Sausage Fest. Silly, feel-good or trippy movies that enhance your experience.  


Food: My first time smoking I invented the Godwaffle. Two waffles, peanut butter and a core inside of maple syrup. Give it a shot! It is still a staple of my friends to this day.  


Enjoy your experience and to quote Borderlands 2,  


""Mayhem awaits. Bring friends""

You can also look into vaporizers that do not combust the herb, but that's for later. You may wish to try it and see the difference, or you may not and that's okay too. Cannabis as a hobby is like cigars or whiskey. It's about what you like and nothing else matters. 

I can't speak for everyone, but I'm very much interested. I adore hearing the tales of first-timers! Cannabis is something I use rather infrequently, but when I do, I enjoy it very much. It makes music sound 'wider', food taste much better, friends become family and (not to be inappropriate but for informative purposes) 'intimate activities' become mind-blowing.

By all means, update the thread or post new ones with how you're feeling. Remember, for many of us our enjoyment of cannabis is a lifelong hobby. It's not a race, and don't let others try to push or bully you into doing things you do not want. 

I hope your 'trip' is everything you want, and I'll be here tonight to talk you down in the very small chance that it isn't. We as a community love first-timers, and are happy to make sure yours is a bunch of fun!

"Back when I decided to deal, I sat down and made a list of all the things I hated in the dealers I experienced. I set out to change that and had a lot of fun along the way. While I retired from that life permanently years ago after two very close pinches with the law, I thought I'd share the things I did, not to tell others to do them of course. But as a sort of trip down memory lane and to show you that not all dealers are terrible.

First, each customer got a unique number that I kept in a log book and a business card for StoneBaked Pizza that had little pizza heart punches along the bottom. Each time they filled up the card with 10 punches, they got a free gram and a new card. Each card came with a scratch-off heart on the back that would be a little bonus from reduced punch requirements, free papers to blunts and even sometimes a free gram or glass piece.

Second, I had many fun policies. For example, I treated your time like an appointment window. If I said you'd be served between X and Y o'clock, if I was not there you got a free gram. It's your birthday? Free gram. It's 4/20? Free gram! Turn in 10 jars? Free gram. Refer 3 people to me? Free gram. I was the Oprah of weed :-p. I also had dual-scale verification of product upon request. My scale and the customer's scale were placed side by side and the weed was weighed out on both to ensure they got exactly what they paid for.

I get a big ol' smile just remembering it, I truly loved what I did and had a passion for it. I'm really sorry that your dealers are not treating your time or intellect with respect, and as someone also in an illegal state I can commiserate.

The leader of Senate (republican) says he's open minded, but has power to kill vote on bill that comes though (which he has strongly hinted he may due if there isn't ""strong"" public support).  So the senate might not even get a chance to vote on it if he kills the vote on it.  

If it gets a vote in senate, all dems and 2 republicans would have to vote yes.  A couple dems [in senate] are playing shy so might have to convenience more republicans to vote a yes.

So... we have a good chance, but a lot of pieces need to fall into place.  **Mostly importantly people need to get out there and start letter writing and contacting their representatives as soon as they take their new seats.**  That matters more than anything else here.

The public needs to let them know this is a priority, otherwise it will get lost in the shuffle with everything else going on.

It occupies the northern central part of the United States. It was officially named the North Central Region by the Census Bureau until 1984. It is located between the Northeastern United States and the Western United States, with Canada to its north and the Southern United States to its south.

"Is there a reason you hate glass? It's definitely cleaner and healthier than burning and inhaling rolling papers. 

When you put a dab on a joint like this, it melts when the cherry gets to it then gets soaked up by the surrounding weed. If you toke hard and constant you could get all the wax just as you would from a pipe, but if you stop the wax will continue to vaporize as you hold the joint. 

Also, any contaminants introduced during the extraction process of making wax will get inhaled as well. When using glass the resin that sticks to the glass has a high concentration of those contaminants. 

If it's putting the glass to your mouth that's the problem, you can do hot knives. If including metal/glass in the smoking process is the problem, I don't know what to tell you.

"It's basically a cutout of a human body from the top of the legs up until the brain. The graphics of the body won't be very graphic, but good enough to understand what each part is. There are also different views. 

You can view each organ system separately, for example you could choose the circulatory filter and it will only show the blood vessel layout of the body and the heart. You can click the digestive system filter and you can see all the parts of the digestive system, omitting all other organs. These filtered views help you to see each parts and help determine problems faster. 

There is also the default view, which all parts are visible, but some organs like the kidneys, could be hidden from view due to other organs being overtop. 

There is a status bar at the top that shows you what the human is doing. Resting, smoking, swimming, if the human is tired, exerted, cold, hot, etc. Basically how the human is feeling.

There would be guidelines to help you, of course like what hormone to release when the human smokes, what the lowest suggested heart rate you can set without risking any organs, etc. 

Any organ or vessel, part you click have properties you can view, and options you can set. Click on the skin and you can choose whether to sweat or not, and how much. There are also speed rates at which things happen, like how much water is used per hour from sweating. 

Click on a blood vessel and it will tell you the contents of the blood, iron, salt, pressure, sugar, etc. ",-notsopettylift3r-,ebb2fix,trees

> &quot;The vast majority of Americans believe the war on drugs needs to be replaced with a health-centered approach. It is critically important that the next Attorney General be committed to defending basic rights and moving away from failed drug war policies. William Barr is a disastrous choice.""

> Today&#039;s drug policy landscape is a lot different than it was in the early 1990s and it&#039;s yet to be seen how Barr, if confirmed by the Senate, will navigate conflicting state and federal marijuana laws.

Cannabis being illegal here, it is very difficult to 1) find a trusted dealer who isn’t police or PDEA (Philippine DEA) peddling confiscated bud in a buy-bust operation (foreigners get caught, pay huge wads of cash, and then get deported) and 2) find good quality bud that is either a) locally-grown, but harvested early and/or cured improperly before being compressed into sheets, so that it could be smuggled in boxes in the luggage compartments of buses that run from the northern (mountainous) regions down to Manila and vice-versa or b) imported illegally from North America and overpriced as shit to cover the Customs guy who needs to turn a blind eye to balikbayan boxes where a pound (or a few) are stashed under some food, shoes, bags, and other goods that Filipinos who live here but are able to afford trips to the US/Canada buy for their relatives here. 

Meanwhile, our president jokes about taking a toke to stay awake as innocent kids are shot and then have sachets of stems and seeds planted on their person to protect the big Chinese mafia-funded labs set up in exclusive villages and their local distributors (either politicians or retired police/army generals) who peddle meth (called ‘shabu’) to the poor, hungry, and uneducated masses.

"Most high-quality bud (locally referred to as ‘kush’ as a blanket term, regardless if it is a ______ Kush strain or not) is imported.

I’ve tasted grass that’s been grown properly inside a town house and foreigners tell me it’s just as good as back home, but again, there’s the danger of the smell (housing here is cramped in the different cities of Metro Manila) and you’ll have no shortage of suspicious neighbours who’ll have no problem reporting you to the local authorities for the prize money. 

Not to mention, people are just paranoid as shit in our current political climate. It’s an understatement to stay that it’s difficult to trust anyone right now.

I experienced everything you talked about my first time as well, and it's why I still enjoy the hobby ten years later. It gets better when you have parties and smoking sessions with buddies (and this is coming from an introvert!). Your experience made many of us ents giggle because we often like getting first-timers high. You and your friends will start to develop rituals and traditions and customs all your own, it's part of the hobby and part of the fun!  


I'll give you the bad news first. You often don't ever get as high as you do the first time. Now for the good news. You still get really, \*really\* high. Like 95% of the way there consistently. There are also different methods to get high that can bring back that 'first time' feeling.  


You definitely got very high, and will likely do so again at your leisure. You may venture into buying your own glass pieces and having your own herb stash. Or you may not, that's okay too.

Depending on your usage patterns, what works for me may not work for you. I am a self-admitted cheap bastard and light user (2 times a month or so), and I like to really get value.

For portable, I have the DaVinci Miqro. I got it for $111 on Black Friday and it's perfect for when you don't want to share your vape. One oven packs about 0.2g, just enough to toast one person (in my case).

For home use, the EpicVape E-Nano is a tiny little log vape that can turn a crumb into a plume in my experience. I highly recommend it. While it is $200, I've seen it drop to $150 on special sales.

On the surface, the reform argument seems to make a lot of sense: fascists are able to use the ready made state machinery in a way the left can't, and so it's clearly better to have social-democrats (even ineffective ones!) in power rather than fascists. We don't even have to consider whether or not social-democrats are actually able to carry out their program: better that the state be ineffective than genocidal. Basic harm reduction. Case closed. But what these well-meaning leftists miss is that electoral politics and ideological struggle are not simply a matter of running interference against fascism. 

In fact, the weakness of social-democracy, and the left's cowardice in hiding behind 'reasonable' social-democrats, helps pave the way for fascism.

Social-democrats have had all sorts of chances to remedy this through electoral projects, and every time they've failed. We can think of the NDP provincial governments in Canada, Allende in Chile, PODEMOS in Spain, SYRIZA in Greece, Labour governments in the UK, the PS in France; the list goes on. In every situation, victorious social-democrats wind up administering austerity rather than providing a viable alternative against it. Why this is the case is outside the scope of this post, but empirically, this is what has happened. And every election, the left engages in a process of collective amnesia, and says that this time will be different. And every time it isn't: the left goes hard for social-democrats, tells millions of people that voting in X or Y social-democratic government will mean an improvement in living conditions, and every time the social-democrats fail.

The far right, when it does its job right, acknowledges the existence of class struggle but seeks to end it in the interest of the unity of the nation: hence we get the anti-capitalist populism of fascism (me) When social-democrats win elections, promise to fix things, but in reality end up overseeing deteriorating living conditions, this isn't just a loss for the left but a victory for the right. Because it shows to the masses that what the right has been saying -that the left can't make good on its promises, that only the far-right can solve things, that immigrants are to blame, etc.- is correct. At best loss after loss for the left results in politically disengaged workers; at worst it actively puts them over into the enemy camp. The failure of social-democracy to make good on its promises is a breeding ground for fascism.

This is what we saw in Greece: the failure of SYRIZA to combat the Troika was a victory for Golden Dawn. In France the failure of the PS and even the centrists meant a victory for the Front Nationale. In the UK the failure of Labour to rid itself of Blair's 'third way' nonsense directly helped UKIP and the National Front. The failure of the Congress and Communist parties in India results in Modi. And now in Brazil, the weakness of the social-democracy of the PT has resulted in victory for Bolsonaro.



Don't get me wrong I still think its possible to get tiny victories through elections, but its more important to organize in the streets. Keep it based on issues (if you get the chance to vote on weed, or prison reform, or healthcare, take it) but never hold your breath, and never stop organizing. Long term change can only be built through smashing the existing state machinery and building a state in which the working-class has political power.

(Also while I am at it, a 33% non-White electorate plus the ""liberal urban"" 20% of the Whites only gets you to about 46% of the vote at absolute most. 100%*33% + 20%*67% ~ 46%. Of course non-White voters aren't 100% Democratic.)

Which is closer to the actual reason the South is so Republican, as it happens.

Also do a lot of research about the medicines they are gonna pump through your body. The side effects of pharma meds can be life altering and permanent. They have helped a lot of people but also harmed a lot others. Decide how much you trust them based on how much effort they put on finding out your problem and finding how to fix it.

In the low potency cigarette conditions, plasma THC levels were not significantly different after 10 sec and 20 sec than after 0 sec of breathholding.*

 In this study holding your breath was scientifically proven to increase THC blood plasma levels,if you have decent weed, it also mentions 2 other tests that corroborate it and 2 that say breath holding doesn't affect it:-  


*Post hoc tests indicated that 10-sec and 20-sec breathhold durations for high potency cigarettes produced plasma THC levels that were significantly higher than all other conditions. In the low potency cigarette conditions, plasma THC levels were not significantly different after 10 sec and 20 sec than after 0 sec of breathholding.*   


That bit about low potency explains the contradicting tests. A large portion of cannabis research done in the US has been using 1-3% THC weed. Literally garbage.

That still leaves the question of how long to hold on for, which, I think this has been fairly well established now, depends on the volume of THC in the bud. Huh. Based on the research that got posted (I'm on mobile, can't get the guys name), maybe 1 sec per % of THC?

But on the real man, your article was good and made valid points. And as you quoted 20 seconds of holding doesnt do anything more than 10 seconds of holding. 


So it makes me ask, whats the point of holding a hit for a long time when only a couple seconds are necessary?  What about concentrates? Does holding a hit do the same thing, theres not much info on this subject. 

Plasma THC levels can also differ due to how frequently one smokes, how big of a hit they got, and if the test was taken right after smoking or short period after. 

Can you find a article thats also not near 25 years old? With new strains and types of ways of consumption, this article seems slightly outdated. 


Btw I’ll repeat all the bullshit i want, i dont want some new smoker passing out on me because they thought they had to hold a hit forever. Not today Satan, not today",HolaPutitos,ebb2u3o,trees
"Just held in a dab, can confirm i got pretty high but its hard to notice a difference. Maybe the concentration of thc isnt necessarily related to how high you get",aaaaanddumptheclutch,ebb8381,trees

"meh, my lungs are mostly just genes. Some work (I sing), but mostly luck.

Regardless, tonight, I will *not* hold my breath as long as possible as I usually do. 5-7 secs from now on!",Draco9630,ebb8xj4,trees
"So you just read my post then say ' when only a couple seconds are necessary ' despite the study I linked showing you get higher by holding it for longer? 10s hold after a 3-5s inhale time is considerably more than a couple of seconds. 

&#x200B;

As I explained, the results are screwed by the very low amount of cannabinoids in the test. The 'high potency' used was 3.5% THC, the low potency was 1.75%. The 20s hold in this test didn't show much more effect because by that time the actual % of cannabinoids in the smoke was too small to notice. 

&#x200B;

Concentrates I haven't seen any data on, but vapor from dry herb vapes is around 98% cannabinoids so it should be similar. In the case of dry herb vapes, it was found that 35% of the THC was exhaled. 

Unfortunately there aren't many studies due to being illegal in most places. I can't find shit until someone actually does it.

"Lol I actually read the link, which i why i said you had valid points. You did not explain but rather rewrote what you read, because i read the same words in article. This is why i asked whats the point of trying to hold it in so long when only a couple seconds work and are necessary. (Maybe our definitions of couple seconds are different, in my opinion when someone says a couple, i give approximately 5 maybe more)

the plasma THC level, which i looked up, can differ due to other conditions. Such as frequency, quality of weed, when the levels were taken and how big of a hit is drawn, as well as how the body absorbs the thc. So going off just the thc levels can slightly screw these results. 

And yes i have had a friend pass out from trying to hold his hit in because everyone said “hold it in to your nuts bro” and the dumbass listened. 

Until you have recent studies , and not just the ONE 25 year old one you keep linking to everyone, im going to be very skeptical. This article seems to be biased. It also does not seem like the experiment they did was controlled and varied enough to produce accurate results. The sample size needs to be larger and have background conditions ( like frequent use or high tolerances) accounted for, or you get skewed results.

A couple means 2. Not 5. Not 4. Not even 3. 2. Always and forever 2. Not my definition, the ONLY definition. 

&#x200B;

Correct, blood plasma can differ due to other conditions. 

**But you say you read the link, so you already know that those other conditions were accounted for in the experiment, right?**  You read where it tells you each subjects tolerance and use habits?  The exact volume of each hit? The exact timing of each inhale, breath hold and duration? 

&#x200B;

There are at least 4 other studies but they're all older than this one, not that it matters.  

You can be as skeptical as you like but you have zero fucking evidence against actual scientific studies.

"Well MY definition, which i use when someone says give me a couple of this or hold this for a couple seconds. I dont count out two or count down the millisecond, i go up grab a handful or wait more than two seconds. 

So how can they take into account each specific persons thc level and administer these tests? This is why i say the sample needs to be larger.

Example: Have 50 people who smoke daily with vape only, and test. Have 50 people who smoke daily with joints only and test. Have 50 people who smoke daily with bongs/pipes only and test. Have 50 people who smoke once a week with vape and test. Etc

This experiment was not big enough to get accurate results. 

Maybe now with high quality weed and better consumption methods, the results found in this old ass article are probably irrelevant. 

Until you have recent data, its still bull. And once again holding your breath does deprive your brain of oxygen, which makes you feel lightheaded. You dont think that lightheadedness has anything to add along with the high of the weed. Literally that was my main point in the beginning and i dont think you got it. That no oxygen=lightheadedness. Lightheadedness+weed high=really high feeling.

&#x200B;

Scientific data doesn't have a Use By date. Nothing becomes bull just because a few years have passed. 

Holding your breath does not make normal healthy people lightheaded, yes you have asthma and maybe it does for you, but that doesn't mean shit for the average person. It's as relevant as a guy in a wheelchair telling me he has trouble walking after a few joints. 

Not only does it not happen anyway, it wouldn't make any fucking difference if it did anyway! Lack of oxygen doesn't change your fucking blood plasma THC level which is how we're measuring it, nor does it make you breath out 35% of the THC you've breathed in.

Myrcene is a mild analgesic and it give me a lot of the ‘body high’ when consumed with thc. This part is integral for helping me sleep.

"It depends on the type of edible; those 5-10mg drinks some dispensaries carry I think would be a good option. They are pretty fast acting, so you can just drink a small bit at a time until you start feeling effects. Mints too. Best to start slow at first

Also keep in mind the first time you use cannabis you might not feel much of an effect; this is probably why some people end up taking too much their first time. 

Either way, I would take about 5mg, (or more depending on your weight) and then make sure you wait about 2-3 hours before taking any more.",HaileSelassieII,ebaw14o,trees

"Haven’t had weed since I was like 17 years old (until recently)... and even back then I only tried it a few times! 

A few years ago I developed severe diabetic neuropathy in both of my feet, then later had two toes amputated on my left foot and most recently developed 100% foot drop on my right foot! 

Nerve pain is something they just don’t make a pain pill for... i’ve tried everything from Tylenol three to Percocet! Yeah sure, pain pills help take the edge off a little, but they do absolutely nothing for nerve pain! 

When it’s at worst it’s like someone sticking a hot pin in your foot over and over and over and over every few minutes, and last (for me anyway) anywhere from 10 to 24 hours, it goes away for about three or four days and then it strikes again! I can almost set a calendar to it! It’s exhausting! No, I mean really exhausting as in on nights I have the diabetic stinging… I can hang up trying to get any sleep! 

So anyway... after working with my Endocrinologist, podiatrist, neurologist and my general primary doctor for years now... i’ve taken matters into my own hands! 

I have done some research on the benefits of marijuana and nerve damage back when I first developed neuropathy but I didn’t try it because of the stigma that generally comes along with it! The people in my circle would probably frown on the fact that I use it without even considering the reasons why... But I’m like fuck it! 

I found a guy who knows a guy... bought my first ever supply and a cheap pipe! I’ve used it about five times in the past few months and it really helps relax the nerves and alleviate the pain quite a bit! Not 100% but enough where I can sleep! 

The cheap metal pipe I bought sucks or I’m doing something wrong (I think I’m inhaling the fire or something, because the roof of my mouth gets burnt!”) don’t laugh… I’m new to this! So I figured I would try rolling an old fashion joint! Went to the smoke store and got everything the YouTube video told me I needed!

"My uncle has had several chronic health problems for 30+ years and has taken a ridiculous amount of pain pills for just as long. He was prescribed something like 9 pain pills a day, and recently he finally decided to try smoking. He quit ALL of his pain meds and doesn’t need them at all. He had a whole mess of problems due to the pain pills, now he’s fine. He has been vaping it for over 3 months. He literally would take handfuls of pills at a time just to be semi comfortable. Now he doesn’t take any, it blows my mind how they’d rather prescribe pain pills than allow marijuana. I’m so happy for him, and for you!! ",bunnykat99,eb6s23h,trees

place crutch in the paper on the left side between your thumb and finger of your left hand

fill as usual but add more to the top than to the bottom

roll the paper around the crutch until you can tuck it in around it (this is the hardest part and will take some practice)

lick the paper and continue to roll the rest together (it should come together easily since you already started it at the bottom) and seal the paper together

fill the top to your desired amount but leave a little room

"Congrats on finding a way to alleviate the pain.  I went through a few weeks of sciatica, and I know how painkillers don't do anything for nerves.  

Joints are a classic way to go, but I find them too wasteful; half the weed burns up as second-hand smoke.  Ditch your metal pipe and get a glass pipe, or better yet, a glass bong.  Or really any material bong, but one with a glass bowl.  And way better than anything, get a vaporizer!  No harshness at all, and you can control your high much much easier.

"I third (or 4th?) The water bong thing.   First of all, YAY YOU!  Reading your story, there for a minute I thought I was reading mine! Like you, I had such bad nerve pain (due to a blood clot that almost caused me to lose my leg) that I was ready to give up.  Dr even had me on Oxy and it didn’t touch it (and it was a bitch to withdraw from).  But then my cousin, who had smoked all his life, talked me into trying marijuana, and it honestly was like a miracle drug!  After about a year of living near him and being able to get it easily (before it was legal in Florida) I moved to a state where it wasn’t legal so I stopped.  My nerves had regenerated enough that I didn’t really need it anymore.  Then a couple of years later I started having severe ulcerative colitis.  For almost 6 years I kept getting worse, tried all the meds, had infusions, blood transfusions, etc.  Nothing helped and my Dr started talking about removing my entire colon, because nothing she could do could make me better.  I went down to see my cousin for a vacation, smoked while there and within a week I had absolutely no symptoms! I don’t take any medication for the UC now and haven’t since that first trip.  The best part is I haven’t had any symptoms in 2 years! Plus, it helps with other pain.  It will be a happy day when it becomes legal in every state! p.s. I used filters, too, when I first started smoking and was rolling joints, but I find it much easier to use a water bong and I can keep track of how much I’m smoking.  Cold water and an ice cube or two and it’s nice and smooth. :)",ssmc1024,eb6wds6,trees

If you use a water pipe, never mix tobacco in.  A water pipe will result in you needing to use more product to get the effects.  

If you're concerned about effeciency (getting the most for your dollar) and health, there's no better alternative to vaping if you're not going to use edibles.  Joints are a happy medium.

"**Entourage effect**

The entourage effect is a proposed mechanism by which compounds present in cannabis which are largely non-psychoactive by themselves modulate the overall psychoactive effects of the plant (these resulting principally from the action of the main psychoactive component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)).

Cannabidiol (CBD) is believed to be the major modulatory component of cannabis, mitigating some of the negative, psychosis-like effects of THC, and is included in some medicinal formulations alongside THC. CBD co-administration also reduces the negative effects of THC on memory. Myrcene, which is recognized as a sedative component in hops, may be responsible for the sedative effects (""couch lock"") of certain cannabis strains (sedative effects are commonly ascribed to the indica cannabis type). Linalool may also contribute to the entourage effect, modulating the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems to produce sedative and anxiolytic effects.Though the idea of the entourage effect has taken root in the cannabis industry and among consumers, the concept is often based on conjecture and anecdotal evidence as rigorous scientific underpinning is lacking.

It's important that you know your own limits, and use everything in moderation. There's a time and a place for everything. It's also the other substances you probably want to stay away from until later, if at all. 

&#x200B;

You probably want to shy away from psychedelics until you're in your twenties, if you're into any of that. Although, I went to high school with no shortage of individuals who tried acid or ecstacy at least once, and turned out just fine. 

&#x200B;

It's not the substances; it's the kinds of people who use them, and whichever environments these tools at our disposal are consumed in. Stay away from coke. Don't do heroin. Don't get hooked on pills. Surround yourself with positive people.

You can now layer up so paper towels and get them wet ring out most of the water. Place the seeds in the center and fold the paper towel around them. Place that in a paper bag and seal it. 

In a day open it and check the seeds. Seeds that germinate will crack open and be sprouting. You can leave it for two days. Sometimes seeds germinate later then others. Then you can carefully take those and plant them your preferred way. 

Let them grow for roughly six weeks before sexing them. Google how to tell make vs female. That will guide you. Then you obviously separate what you need to.

"It’s as good, if not better than the medicinal grade I’ve seen in MA. The reason it’s so cheap (at least in my experience) is that the ounces come in “pebbles”, which will dry out faster than those big ol stemmy buds. The cheap ounces aren’t so good for saving for more than six months or so (of course, with vacuum seals and the like, longer is possible), but the quality is still top notch, at least from my experience.

I’ve seriously considered taking a trip out there every year because to mail it back would be cheaper, even including the plane ticket... But now that the east coast is getting recreational, I’m hoping the super cheap prices come along with it sometime soon.

Also, when/if you can get out west, shop around. When my wife and I first got off the plane, our first stop was to the closest dispensary. Spent about $200 that could have gotten me more variety and quantity, but still walked out of there with more product than $200 had ever bought me before!

"The Republicans in the Utah legislature had a discussion with the initiative's supporters just prior to the election.  At that time, it had become clear the initiative would likely pass, so the GOP/CLDS were ready to make a deal.

This deal included a ban on edibles and homegrow, and some other assorted restrictions.  The supporters agreed because the hardball alternative was that the legislature was prepared to refuse to ratify the law in session, even if the people passed it.

It's possible the supporters should have just thrown this offer back in their faces and refused the deal.  This would have been very bad PR for the Republicans and possibly even the Church, and court cases would have dragged on for years.  So the GOP had the supporters over the barrel.  If the supporters wanted to help sick people get medicine, any form of medicine under any conditions, they had to surrender and agree to the restrictions.  It's just about enough bullshit to piss a fellow off.

The Republican party has rather quickly transformed itself into an organization that cares little about truth, honor, fairness or the will of the people.

Similar thing happened in Montana.  The people voted for MMJ.  The GOP legislators hamstrung the law, rendering it useless.  So the citizens had to go back to the polls and vote specifically to overturn the legislature's changes.  That worked.

">Does the CBD have different effects if it’s from an indica or Sativa plant? What about different strains?

Indica and sativa will affect the feeling of strains high in CBD, but maybe a little less. Since high CBD strains aren't as strong, the indica and sativa differences also are less dramatic. Keep in mind CBD content is separate from what makes plants indica or sativa. Online and in person people still tend to say that indicas have more CBD and that's why they're indicas, but that's an old rumor that is incorrect. There are sativas and indicas with high CBD, it's a separate thing.

What really changes the effects of high cbd strains and what you should pay attention to is the ratio of CBD to THC. High ratios like 20:1 (cbd:thc) produce very light effects, and thus can mostly be used in the day or night. You'll find some that are more relaxed and some that are brighter, but you won't experience crazy sedation or crazy stimulation because the baseline of the effect is light to begin with. As you get into more even ratios like 4:1 to 1:1, the stimulant/sedative difference starts to matter more, and you'll get more stoned feeling from those.

>What’s the best method for using CBD (cart, pills, wax, edibles)

There is no best method! They all have pros and cons and it really depends on how you're trying to use it. Edibles for sleep are great if you're trying to *stay* asleep, since they last a long time. If your issue is you wake up after 4 hours of sleep, an edible will stay in your system for 6-8 hours so it's more likely to keep you sleeping. If you have trouble falling asleep i'd use something with a more rapid onset, like smoking flower or hitting a vape.

Concentrates like wax are good if you find benefit from very high doses, or have a high tolerance.

Keep in mind that for sleep, CBD itself is not particularly sedative. What it's good at is pain relief and anxiety reduction for the most part. But if you find a strain with the right balance, you may be able to get the sedative aspect of THC, while the CBD helps you keep that anxiety at bay.",Wnslw_,eb9yzk5,trees
"my suggestion would be buy some 99% cbda isolate online(it's legal in all states)... then sprinkle it on top when you smoke weed... that way, it won't matter what type of weed you have, it will always be chill

  

",therewasafire,eba0noe,trees
"Wow, thank you for this! I learned a lot from this comment. If you don’t mind me asking, what are some strains you recommend? I can’t smoke bud ATM so vaping wax would be ideal. I smoked some strains that would make me have so much cotton mouth and so much paranoia, where what I’m looking for is a sort of calming, chill high. ",AlienLechuga,eb9zbxz,trees
"Eh, there are hundreds of CBD rich strains in the US right now, and I feel like listing strains would be pointless. 

Hopefully you have access to dispensaries where they have lab tested cannabis, because you can't trust anyone that their weed is high cbd unless that information comes from a lab analysis. 

If you do have that kind of access, try to find any strain in the 8:1-4:1 cbd:thc range. Those ones will give you a mild buzz but be very calm and much gentler than regular high THC weed. Ratios above 10:1 might leave you unsatisfied due to it being such a mild effect, especially if you're using the THC for sleep. Ratios below 2:1 might still cause that anxiety from too much THC. I mostly recommend above 10:1 for psychological issues like depression and anxiety, but not pain or sleep.

If you don't have access to that, one thing you can do is buy pure CBD products online because it's ""technically"" legal everywhere right now, and combine those with a small dose of your regular THC weed. So like on amazon you can buy cbd pills, and on many websites you can order wax like concentrates that are pure cbd, no thc. Like I just did a google search and this is the first result, pretty sure they'll ship to anywhere in the US: https://www.purecbdvapors.com/cbd-dabs-waxes-shatter/

You could get a CBD wax from there, take a nice fat dab of that, and follow it up with a tiny dab of THC product, and you'll effectively dose yourself with CBD combined with THC. If you want to get really precise about the ratio, get a milligram scale, do some math and weigh the dabs.

"You have to realize that, for example, in most european countries weed is no product but a service. 

Think of it as if your toilet breaks but you have to take a shit. No store is selling toilets in your country so you need a service technician to repair the thing. Now people will tell you that you'll get a better technician online which will take a few days and you can get great toilets in a different country but the thing is: ""I want to take a shit right now"". So you'll probably just choose a tachnician that is available even though he might not be the best you COULD get if willing to wait longer or travel. 

So if I have just a few free days availiable to really take a nice deep shit I don't want to hold it back just to miss those free days. Then I can maybe take one little shit in the evening after work but that's just not as satisfacory as really taking your time enjoying shitting for a few days if you have the time. I just don't want to wait for the right opportunity when I want to shit.

I've been wondering this for a while. I got hold of some thai couple of years back, and the difference in high was very noticeable... I'm not agorophobic, but when high I'd rather chill in familiar environments with familiar friends. But on the thai, I was perfectly happy out and about. Also got major giggles which I don't really get anymore.

This is my theory... modern strains (until recently) have prioritised THC content over CBD. Breeding up THC has resulted in reduced CBD; while older strains are more balanced. Whenever I've smoked very-high-THC strains they always leave me feeling a bit jittery and anti-social.

"Think about some of the places that weed is illegal. China, Saudi Arabia, etc. People can't just walk about asking everyone if they've got a good bud hookup.

I'm from Australia and it's starting to even out, but I see both sides of this. I've bought the driest, most tasteless PGR nonsense you've ever seen... but I've also bought strains like Watermelon Zkittles and Cookies n Cream thanks to some risk-taking growers who import seeds and grow in an illegal country.

""Think of it as if your toilet breaks but you have to take a shit. No store is selling toilets in your country so you need a service technician to repair the thing. Now people will tell you that you'll get a better technician online which will take a few days and you can get great toilets in a different country but the thing is: ""I want to take a shit right here right now"". So you'll probably just choose a tachnician that is available even though he might not be the best you COULD get if willing to wait longer or travel. So if you have just a few free days availiable to really take some nice deep shits you might not want to hold it back just to miss those free days. Then you can maybe take one little shit in the evening after work but that's just not as satisfacory as really taking your time enjoying shitting for a few days if you have the time.""
