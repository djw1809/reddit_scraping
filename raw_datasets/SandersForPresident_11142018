"Ok, I just did this and it was flawless!  My rep is Tina Titus, a good lib and person I believe, and their office was congenial of course.

I did have to take a moment before pushing enter to take stock.  Here, I remembered the policies but then her.  She's on the cable news channels frequently for her insights and delivery.  She's a presence for thoughtful dialogue.  

So, knowledgeable with a nice demeanor, great on policies but is she a leader?  She can lead me with all that, but those that are called reps?  Idk.

Can she defend us from... everything? Anything? Them? Us?

Yes the minimum wage needs to be raised, but I don't think they really stops the exploitation that companies like Walmart and Papa John's employ to generate record profits while also forcing their employees to live on food stamps.

Companies aren't beholden to their government or their employees, but they have a legal responsibility to their shareholders.

America needs to close the under employment loopholes, and needs to find a way to hold company's accountable for the knock on effects of their wage to profit ratio. 

Eg: of you make more than x profits, you are responsible for paying the social services costs of your employees irregardless of their hours. This gives them an incentive to pay a real living wage to avoid paying the cost to the tax payer, and potentially offering better working benefits/conditions as happier & healthier employees are not only more productive but don't cost them money. Right now these companies are not only weaselling out if their social responsibilities as employers, but also using your tax money to subsidize their record growths.

I personally think it's a bit dishonest to pretend they *weren't*. Regardless of the fluctuation, while the stock prices were that high, they could have borrowed money against their net worth, used that money to invest, made more than that in investment income and interest, and barely notice when the stock prices fell again because they'd already seen the benefit of the income while the price was high. And they have, no doubt, done that over and over in the past, even though they might not have this *specific* time. Yet the public doesn't have insight into their personal finances in that way.

"OK. Follow me here (add more than a few zeros to make it more accurate): Your net worth increases, allowing you to be approved for a $1000 loan. You get that loan, invest the money and make $300 interest over the next month. You pay back the loan, plus the $100 loan interest (if you were even charged that, because someone with your credit rating and net worth sometimes *isn't* charged). It leaves you $200 profit in the investment, steadily making interest over the following months until you have another $1000 you can invest in another venue.

Now...at what point in that scenario, do you CARE that your net worth fell again after that initial rise? After you got the loan approval, your net worth affects *nothing*. You still gained the benefit of the rise, were able to take advantage of it, and when it falls again the only thing it affects is how likely it is that you could do it *again* (for which the answer might be 'not right now', but is not likely to be anything close to 'never').

ALSO tell me...how many Walmart employees could make the same investment choices? How many people on food stamps could trade against their net worth in order to secure a loan for investing anything at all?

The point is...whether the gain was in actual physical money or in just the *influence* of money - they still benefited by a $12 billion gain.

It's not splitting hairs at all. You don't seem to really grasp how a public company operates. There's income and expenses. Shareholders are not employees, and are not an expense. That $12 billion did not come from Walmart. In fact, it doesn't exist. It's a current market value.

**Reactionary Wildfire Smoke Defenses:** 

1. Get children, the elderly, & the medically vulnerable out of the area if possible.
2. Use OSHA-certified N95 particulate filtering masks. They come in 3 sizes, stores usually only stock large. Bend the flexible metal strip at the top of the mask so that it fits the curve of the nose. Get it the tightest possible, they have to seal around like a snorkel mask.
3. Set home venting to recirculate.
4. Outfit homes with HEPA filters if you can, and ensure they're changed regularly.

Combat climate change at foundational levels by educating, organizing, & mobilizing to press for public leadership & regulation. We do not have 11 years. We will certainly pass 1.5¬∞C next year. And will likely blow by 2¬∞C in 2020 if we do not pass enact & enforce regulatory legislation in the next year.

**Specifics, Why & What Can Be Done:**

Ball-park: Humanity has used the 20% of Earth's petroleum that was easiest to develop. Half won't be economically feasible to access for centuries. The remaining 30% will be used up over the next 40 years or so if our rate continues on. We must transition from fossil fuels. This is a golden opportunity for us to come together in a common cause and spur on the benefits developed by crushing a challenge.  

>Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5¬∞C... In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5¬∞C, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions decline by about 45%

-[IPCC](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15)

 >To prevent temperatures rising above 2¬∞C, carbon emissions from human activities must be reduced by 25% more than previously estimated [by the IPCC].

>To accomplish the key transitions. Market-based action will not suffice... There must be a comprehensive vision and closely coordinated plans... Shift from a focus on individual cognition to social or structural dimensions of human behavior... As well as triggering the transition to sustainability, a [job guarantee](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/rpr_4_18.pdf ) would ensure full employment, lessen insecurity & the need to compete for environmentally destructive jobs on individual & collective levels.

-Bernie, [Oct 12^th '18](https://youtu.be/SkTTHop3DiI?t=176) 
 
Office holders at all levels must be replaced with representatives who will address the situation to the point of remedy if they do not: 

1. Have low barrier, quick access to regularly talking WITH individual citizens about the topic.  
2. Have a hard & short timeline to present draft legislation for public review that is well beyond sufficient to address this crisis.   
3. Prioritize resources in this regard & set aside political gamesmanship.  
4. Not allow commercial corporations to fund or consult beyond providing requested records.  
5. Publicly tie their employment to their success in remedying the situation.

**Consequences of Apathy & Inadequacy Once Paris Thresholds Are Passed** (various sources):  

>Global warming has a high likelihood to end civilization.

-Swedish Global Challenges Foundation

Health:  

* Elimination of glaciers & snowpack that supplies water to 1.3 billion people  
* Increased heat waves, floods, droughts, and storms  
* Hundreds of millions will suffer negative health consequences
* Reduction in intelligence from air pollution to the equivalent of a year's education being lost  
* Aside from war there's already over 110,000 needless deaths per year due to the situation (including 94,000 children) and upwards of 150 million needless deaths will result from inadequate action  

War: 

* Increase of interpersonal violence by 4%, and intergroup conflict by 14%  

>As greenhouse gas emissions increase, sea levels are rising, average global temperatures are increasing, and severe weather patterns are accelerating... this will devastate homes, land, and infrastructure... exacerbate water scarcity and lead to sharp increases in food costs. The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world. These effects are threat multipliers...  

-Pentagon  

>Extreme weather, climate change, environmental degradation, rising demand for food and water, poor policy decisions and inadequate infrastructure will magnify the continuing trend of unpredictable instability.  

-Director of National Intelligence  

* War in Darfur: Sustained drought encouraged conflict between herders and farmers.  
* Syrian Civil War: Preceded by the displacement of 1.5 million people due to drought-induced crop & livestock failure.  
* Nigerian Insurgency: Anti-government sentiment fueled by natural resource shortages.  
* Somali Civil War: Violence brought on by droughts and extreme high temperatures.  

Economics:  

* 0.25 change in ocean acidity  
* Collapse of the Atlantic Flow  
* Risk of extinction for further 25% of plant and animal species
* Disruption of agriculture, fisheries, forestry, energy, construction, insurance, financial services, tourism, and recreation industries  
* 56cm-8m sea level rise (much due to positive feedback permafrost gassing)  
* 250 million climate migrants by 2050  
* Trillions in investments controlled by conservative entities (such as Alaska's permanent fund, Swiss Re, Whitman College, the AMA etc.) are now [rapidly exiting their fossil fuel positions](https://gofossilfree.org/divestment/commitments/)  
* Economic impact after Paris thresholds are passed: [~$4 trillion/year](http://unionsforenergydemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sternreview_report_complete.pdf)

>In our schools and colleges, we need to put greater emphasis on economists working with students on global inequality and poverty. We need more scientists exploring the root causes of the planetary climate crisis and the necessity of sustainable development and renewable energies. We need greater focus in teacher-education programs on sharing the latest neuroscience discoveries and considering their implications for nurturing curiosity, creativity and confidence and cultivating a thirst for lifelong learning.  

>A consistent interdisciplinary approach can bring students in various fields together to work collaboratively in teams and respectful civil discourse: Discussions about why policies that are best for the largest number of people, fairer for all, are ‚Äì or are not ‚Äì adopted in our nation‚Äôs capitals. We can incorporate real-world case studies that review policies and actions not just from a what happened perspective, but one of why, what were the results, and how could have been done better.  

>Educating for global citizenship requires the ability to think critically, write clearly and communicate effectively. It requires media literacy and analysis. It requires an understanding of sustainable development, and the ability to identify and research complex issues. And it requires ethical behavior.  

>We need to voice our opposition when we see the harsh, divisive and partisan rhetoric or the politics of personal destruction at work, regardless of whether we support or oppose the speaker or the target. Demand that candidates give reasons to vote for them, not against their opponents. Press the media for in-depth coverage about issues that affect our lives.  

-[Dr. Jane Sanders](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/jane-o-meara-sanders-how-to-fix-western-democracy-1.3654715)  

>Media is about what is not covered. The more important the issue is to large numbers of working people, the less interesting it is to corporate media. Issues being pushed by the top 1% get a lot of attention. My candidacy, alone, accounted for the majority of attention that network Sunday news shows paid to poverty in America, one of the great crises facing the nation. National television coverage ignores the reality of important parts of American life. Corporations have an agenda that serves their bottom line. In fact, that‚Äôs the reason for their existence. The largest media corporations are themselves owned by even larger conglomerates that have their own particular set of economic interests.  

>The extraordinary power of the multinational corporations provides billions of dollars a year in advertising revenue to the corporate owners of the media. These powerful corporations have an agenda. Six corporations control 90% of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy...  

>The political revolution, our revolution, must continue. Stay involved and get your friends involved. Run for the school board, city council, state legislature. Run for governor. Run for Congress. Run for the Senate. Run for president. Hold your elected officials accountable. Know what they‚Äôre doing and how they‚Äôre voting‚Äîand tell your neighbors. But transforming our nation is more than just elections. It‚Äôs about changing our culture.  

>Demand that the media focuses on the real issues facing our nation and the world, not just political gossip. And if corporate media won‚Äôt change, and they won‚Äôt, start new media. The Internet offers revolutionary prospects.  

>The future is in your hands. Let‚Äôs get to work.

"> their passivity and utter spinelessness, along with their absolutely idiotic pleas for bipartisanship makes them just as complicit in cataclysmic climate change as the gop

I'm not going to defend those like Pelosi, but the Democrats haven't had control of a single chamber in 8 years, so the ""idiotic pleas for bipartisanship "" was *literally the only option* unfortunately. There was a two year window where Democrats could do something (2008-2010) and unfortunately the world economy was in the toilet and they really only got the ACA passed (understandably as it was incredibly unpopular at the time). The Democrats did do something, and the GOP obstructed essentially everything they tried for the past decade or so.  Blaming the Dems on climate change issues in this fashion is like blaming astronauts for not being able to survive without a space suit in space. Let me be clear, I support Bernie and I think his platform is the best thing we've got, but simply put Dems are in their current situation mostly because the GOP fucked up politics in America.

"Alright. Let‚Äôs look at 2016.

Bernie Sanders won 45% of the vote and was close enough to force a contested convention. He did well enough to get several of his people on the platform committee, and he forced them to create the Unity Reform Commission, which has passed important reforms that will make the finances of the DNC more transparent going forward as well as enormously weakening the power of Superdelegates by preventing them from voting on the first ballot. He did all of this prior to having the national name recognition and organization that he has now.

Jill Stein, running with a progressive third party that has been working for decades to build a movement outside the major parties, earned 1% of the popular vote and 0 electoral votes. In 2012 she only earned 0.36%. Every third party candidate combined earned less than 6% of the vote. No third party candidate has won any electoral votes since George Wallace won a handful of southern states in 1968.",WhoAteMyPasghetti,e9ohfdg,SandersForPresident

I'm sorry, but if you think Bernie Sanders, the most popular politician in America, would earn 1 or 2% of the popular vote if he ran third party, that's insanity.  When was the last time that someone of Bernie's stature ran as third party?  Comparing him to Jill Stein is hardly a reasonable comparison.

People care less about parties than they have in probably seventy or eighty years.  This is the time to do it.",thegeebeebee,e9oiq67,SandersForPresident
"Gary Johnson and Will Weld, the Libertarian candidates, had a ton of name recognition because they were both former Governors. They also got a bunch of media coverage every time Gary said something stupid (and as Trump proved, no press is bad press). They only got 3% of the popular vote.

The only time a minor party candidate has finished second (outside of a realignment) was when former President Teddy Roosevelt ran with the Bull Moose Party, He only won 27% of the vote and 6 states totaling 88 electoral votes. This allowed his opponent, Woodrow Wilson, to stride into an easy victory despite only earning 42% of the popular vote. Had he not split the Republican vote, Taft would have almost certainly been reelected.",WhoAteMyPasghetti,e9ojla7,SandersForPresident
"Sorry, you just can't compare Gary Johnson and Will Weld to Bernie Sanders.  If they have a ton of name recognition, Bernie has 1,000 tons.

If you want to go back in time, then, we can look at Andrew Jackson, who led the third-party Democratic Party to victory, and we can look at Abraham Lincoln, who led the third-party Republican Party to victory.  

Lastly, you can't look at it as ""oh, no what if we help Trump to victory.""  We are in a war against time; these risks have to be taken.  A typical Democrat, I would propose, is barely different from a Republican insofar as ACTUAL progress against global warming.  For evidence, see Obama for eight years.

>* Democrats flipped the Maine Senate, the Minnesota House, & won super-majorities in the Oregon House & Senate  

>* Republicans only flipped the Alaskan House  

>* Washington State passed a strong gun safety ballot measure  

>* Michigan voters legalized recreational marijuana. Medical Marijuana was approved in MO, OK, & UT  

>* Missouri & Arkansas they passed increase to the minimum wage  

>* Nevada approved a significant increase in the amount of required renewable energy  

>* automatic voter registration & and expansion of voting rights in a number of states [Florida granted voting rights to well over 1,000,000 citizens] 

>* lot of good measures in terms of housing for the homeless  

>* highest mid-term turnout in ~100 years  

>* the highest increase found in those under 30 (who now are overwhelmingly voting for Democrats)  

>* Democrats did better among both men & (especially) women

TYT is solid. The volunteer wing, [TYT Army](https://join.tytnetwork.com/tytarmy/), just got a revamp. It's being led by [Alison Hartson](https://twitter.com/HartsonForCA) who was Justice Democrats pick to run against Dianne Feinstein to become a US Senator.  

[Justice Democrats](https://www.justicedemocrats.com/volunteer) was started by Cenk, Kyle, and 2 Bernie 2016 officials independently of TYT. They're solid too.  

The Poor People's Campaign has now morphed into [Repairers of the Breach](https://www.breachrepairers.org) and are certainly worth your time to investigate.

Join both the [Democratic Party](https://asdc.democrats.org/state-parties/) & the [DSA](http://www.dsausa.org/).

>People are not only running for office, but for Democratic Party offices all across this country. I was just at a DNC meeting in Chicago... 30% were 'Bernie' elected people. Change is happening but we have go to accelerate it. That requires young people and people who have turned away from the political process to reengage, to DemEnter and take the party back so we can take the country back...   

>How you put pressure on the DNC is to run in county committee elections. And you work and help whichever Presidential candidate you want to support because in that process there's a whole process for electing the DNC members from the various states, and you need to be involved...

"You can pre-register yourself (or wait until 18 and register). You can make your family members are registered.

"Nice to see you engage. I'm of a strong opinion that you will find in left, leftist forums. Basically, the sooner you get radical the better. Kyle Kuliniski is great, but he's a social democrat, so is Bernie from what I understand. He might be a democratic socialist but none of his proposals suggest it.

The fact is that capitalism will always unravel any progressive accomplishments. They've done so in the U.S and they are about doing it in my home country of Sweden. It's been happening for 30 years here as well, just more slowly.

Basically, know that any change made inside the capitalist system is not forever. It will be undone by the financial powers that stand to gain from a miserable society. Not to mention social democracy does nothing to further living standards in the ""third world"". We are standing on their backs to keep the consumer economy turning.

Nothing wrong by incremental change. Healthcare and education is a human right. But know that there is another, larger goal beyond the bare necessities. And that is a society made for all people. And that can not exist under capitalism.",Solidarity365,e9mrt8o,SandersForPresident

"It's Veteran's Day and I can't help but to recall Pelosi's **unforgivable** stance on war.

\--  Congressional approval to continue funding of the ongoing war in Iraq, a major segment of the $90 billion supplemental appropriate package, passed in June 2009 thanks to heavy-handed pressure by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against anti-war Democrats.

\--In 2004 Peloski endorsed the hawkish Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who co-sponsored the House resolution authorizing Bush to invade Iraq at the time and circumstances of his choosing. When Gephardt dropped out of the race, Pelosi threw her support to Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was also among the minority of Democrats on Capitol Hill who had voted to authorize Bush's war. It wasn't until major protest and backlash that Nancy Pelosi finally spoke out in favor of an end to the war.

--During the first twelve weeks of 2003, there were a series of large demonstrations against the war here in Pelosi's district, including one on Feb. 16 that brought out a half-million people. While Lynn Woolsey and [Barbara Lee](https://lee.house.gov/issues/global-peace-and-security?latest=201) \-- congresswomen from a neighboring districts -- spoke at the rally, **Pelosi was notably absent.**

">Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was also among the minority of Democrats on Capitol Hill who had voted to authorize Bush's war.

This is a bit of a misleading statement.  A majority of Democrats in the Senate voted to approve the War (58% of them, 29 out of 50) but a majority of Democrats in the House voted against the resolution (\~60.3% voted for it, or 126 out of 209.

> It wasn't until major protest and backlash that Nancy Pelosi finally spoke out in favor of an end to the war. 

That's because *at the time of the vote* for the Iraq War Resolution, [a majority of Americans supported the war](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/19/iraq-war-continues-to-divide-u-s-public-15-years-after-it-began/).  When Bush first started pushing for the war, and leading up to the vote, there was something like 70% support for invading Iraq because of misinformation spread on the topic.  It wasn't until a couple years later that we realized it was a giant lie.  It wasn't until [a year later that public opinion started to shift](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1633/iraq.aspx).  That Gallup Tracking site also asked over time whether people thought we were deliberately mislead into the war, and it wasn't until mid-2005 that a majority of those polled expressed that opinion.  It also has biweekly polls leading up to the resolution that show 52-75% of people polled supported removing Saddam, and only 27-43% opposed the idea.

"> Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.

Basically you have people living in rural slums of houses (I see it all around me) earning $25k/year that don't want taxes raised on people making $1M+/year because they're disillusioned to the point of thinking that they're going to eventually win the lottery or hit the ""American Dream"". When in reality the statistics show that their kids and their kids' kids are going to be in the same socioeconomic class as them.

The same reason they rally against estate taxes when their 1 acre (4000 m^2 ) plot of land and trailer aren't ever going to get taxed. Estate taxes are just set up to prevent Donald Trumps and Paris Hiltons from sitting back and riding on their parents and grand parents success.

">She‚Äôs been speaker a couple times now and doesn‚Äôt know how to hold the House. Republicans by far have held the majority in the House and Senate.

This is... not true.  Nancy Pelosi was the first woman to be Speaker of the House and took over in January 2007 after the 2006 Midterms, and served as Speaker until January 2011 after Democrats got crushed in the 2010.  The Speakers job isn't exactly to handle House Elections.  That is the responsibility of the DCCC and individual candidates, who used to coordinate with the DNC to setup footholds across the country to recruit candidates and manage fundraising.  The problem is, when Obama took over as leader of the party after his election in 2008, he chopped the system in half and created a ""Grassroots"" organization that was responsible for getting out the vote and had no infrastructure in place.  That organization siphoned resources from the DNC/DSCC/DCCC and resulted in them having to give up on a lot of areas because they just didn't have the resources to compete there.  By the time Democrats realized how badly things had gotten, they had already lost the House, and were hemorrhaging support across the country.  

Combine that with the Republican plan after the 2008 election known as [Project REDMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REDMAP) to try and redistrict the hell out of the country, the nonsense that was the Tea Party, and resentment from the public over the stumbles of a sabotaged Affordable Care Act, and it's easy to see why the Democrats suffered so badly in the House.  All that being considered, it's hard to see how any of the responsibility falls on Nancy Pelosi, who I will remind you got several incredibly difficult bills through the House including a version of the ACA with the Public Option and a historic Climate Change bill.",neurosisxeno,e9lftmn,SandersForPresident

"**Tax Wall Street Speculators**

* Create a tax on Wall Street to significantly reduce speculation and high frequency trading. 
 1. This plan would provide a tax credit to individuals making under $50,000 and couples making under $75,000 to ensure that they would not be impacted.
 2. Trades would be taxed at a rate of 0.5% for stocks, 0.1% for bonds, and 0.005% for derivatives.   

---  

As part of [Making the wealthy pay their fair share](https://berniesanders.com/issues/making-the-wealthy-pay-fair-share):  

**Reforming the Corporate Tax Code**  

* End the rule allowing American corporations to defer paying federal income taxes on profits of offshore subsidiaries.
* Prevent corporations from avoiding U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company through the establishment of a post office box in a tax haven country.  
* Eliminate tax breaks for big oil, gas, and coal companies.  
* Prevent American companies from avoiding U.S. taxes by corporate inversions.  
* Close loopholes that allow U.S. corporations to artificially inflate or accelerate foreign tax credits.


**Reforming the Estate Tax**

* Exempt the first $3.5 million of an individual‚Äôs estate from the estate tax.
* A 45% tax that would only impact the wealthiest 0.3% of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million. 50% for $10-$50 million of value, 55% for $50+ million, and an additional billionaire‚Äôs surtax of 10%.  

* End tax breaks for dynasty trusts.
 1. Strengthen the ‚Äúgeneration-skipping tax‚Äù by applying it with no exclusion to any trust set up to last more than 50 years.
 2. Bar donors from taking assets back from GRATs just a couple of years after establishing them 
 3. Ensure walthy families pay income taxes on earnings generated by assets in ‚Äúgrantor trusts.‚Äù
 4. Sharply limit the annual exclusion from the gift tax for gifts made to trusts.

* Close other loopholes in the estate and gift tax, including valuation discounts.
* Protect farm land and conservation easements, 
 1. Allow family farmers to lower the value of their farmland by up to $3 million for estate tax purposes.
 2. Increase the maximum exclusion for conservation easements to $2 million.

**Lift the cap on taxable income that goes into the Social Security Trust Fund**

* Tax on all income above $250,000 to expand Social Security benefits and to ensure that Social Security remains solvent for the next 58 years. 98.5% of wage earners would not see their taxes go up.  


**Reforming the Personal Income Tax**

* End Tax Breaks for Capital Gains and Dividends for the Wealthy: Repeal the special, low income tax rates on capital gains and stock dividends for married couples with incomes greater than $250,000.  

* Higher Income Tax Rates for the Wealthiest 2.1% percent of households.  
 1.  37% on income $250,000-$500,000.
  2.  43% on income $500,000-$2 million.
  3.  48% on income $2 million-$10 million.
  4.  52% on income $10 million and above. 

* Limit tax deductions for the rich: Replace the Alternative Minimum Tax, PEP, and the limit on itemized deductions with a $0.28 dollar limit on tax savings for each dollar of deductions for households with incomes above $250,000.

"> Do people understand what free schools and Medicare for all do to our taxes?

Your taxes will go up less than what you pay now in premiums, unless you're so wealthy as for it to not even matter anyway. People who have already been through school might not see a personal benefit to free higher education, but their children will. Or maybe they want to go back to school to study for a new field. The idea that we can't pay for that, when we pay for school up through highschool already, just doesn't make sense.

""We can't afford it"". Why not? You don't keep paying the healthcare premiums or the tuition costs of you start paying for them through taxes; they don't pile up together. And if the richest nation in the world can't afford it, then why do other countries manage to?

Healthcare costs and inadequate coverage is *killing* and *bankrupting* people. Student loan debt is creating a massive bubble that is destroying our economy by draining money that would be invested and spent on homes, cars, and goods into interest on loans.

This country and its economy cannot survive these problems. It's not that we can't afford to do these things. We can't afford *not* to do them. But the left is fucking *garbage* at getting its message out, properly messaging with the appropriate facts and stats, and controlling the narrative. So we have disingenuous ""how do we pay for it?"" discussions or people saying ""medicare for all with cost 32 trillion dollars"" while omitting that the 32 is compared to the 34 we *currently spend* on healthcare. You frame it that way when you want to push a narrative, not when you're arguing in good faith. Nobody looks at a competing internet company and thinks ""well shit it's $50 a month I can't afford that on top of the $90 I pay now..."" Obviously you stop paying the 90 and you take the better deal of 50. But when we talk about *healthcare*, people flat out spread *lies* painting it as something else.

So do I understand what medicare for all would do to my taxes? I'm fucking out $400 a *month* for insurance premiums which next year will be for a bottom of the barrel plan. That's $4800 a year just for the *privilege* of still having a several thousand dollar deductible and paying for care when I need it. That premium is a 10% tax on me if I was making 50k a year, and I'm *not*, not even counting the thousands more I'd have to spend to actually get care. Even if my taxes went up ten fucking percent (which they will NOT), I'd *still* be better off because I could go in for care that I wouldn't *still* have to pay out of pocket for or have a deductible on.

 [She supported the water down Blue Dog version of the public option over the more robust one favored by progressives](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/65231-negotiated-rate-healthcare-bill-to-be-presented-to-house-dems-thursday). Even then, she could barely get enough votes to pass the legislation, with many Blue Dogs voting against it (Paul Ryan actually got a larger percentage of GOP members on board with the GOP plan). Later when progressives in the Senate tried to save the public option (which would have only required 50 votes, despite the misinformation that usually gets spread around saying it needed 60), [she worked to stop their efforts](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/86447-pelosi-public-option-will-not-be-in-health-bill).

I don't think she's particularly effective. [A lot of House Democrats seem to dislike her autocratic leadership style as well](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/opinion/sunday/make-way-for-young-democratic-leaders.html), and calls for her to finally end her 15 years of leadership have come from Democrats across the political spectrum.",Chathamization,e9lmsgr,SandersForPresident
"Can you go into detail about what legislation they passed? My memory may be failing me but what I remember is them fighting amongst themselves for years before finally passing Romneycare. 


Here's what I remember her for:


Pelosi voted for unequivocal support for, and condemnation of those protesting the Iraq war.

Later in Jan 2005 she still refused to join the dems who got their heads back on straight and continued to oppose the side of the party pushing for withdrawal in Iraq

In nov 2005 when Murtha called for immediate withdrawal she stood up and used her time to hang him out to dry saying that ""He speaks only for himself"" 

She supported and continues to support the Patriot Act and all of the insanity that it has brought us. 

When it didn't make a difference, she blasted Trump's tax cuts but meanwhile supported the exact same trickle down policy under Bush where they needed her support in order to pass them. 



So yeah, if you want a pro-war, pro-patriot act, Neo-liberal economic agenda to be pushed forward then sure you're absolutely right Pelosi is for you and she can get that done.

>One of the major reasons why the middle class is collapsing and the gap between the rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider is because of the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street.

>Millions of Americans lost their homes, life savings, and ability to pay for college because Wall Street gamblers crashed the economy in 2008.

>During the financial crisis, the taxpayers of this country provided Wall Street with the largest bailout in the history of this world ‚Äî $700 billion from the Treasury Department and $16 trillion in total financial assistance from the Federal Reserve.

>While Wall Street has fully recovered from the recession and, in many cases has never had it so good, the typical middle class family is earning less income today than it did 26 years ago and students are drowning in debt. It is time for Wall Street to pay society back for the tremendous damage it did to the middle class of this country.

>Senator Sanders will fight for the creation of a tax on Wall Street to significantly reduce speculation and high frequency trading which nearly destroyed the economy seven years ago.

>Importantly, this initiative would also raise the revenue necessary to make public colleges and universities tuition free, create jobs, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, protect our environment, and make other investments in our future.

>This proposal would not tax investors, retirees, or parents saving to send their kids to college. Instead, it would impose a tax on Wall Street investment houses, hedge funds, and other speculators. If those Wall Street investment houses chose to pass the tax along to investors, this plan would provide a tax credit to individuals making under $50,000 and couples making under $75,000 to ensure that they would not be impacted.

>Under this proposal, trades would be taxed at a rate of 0.5 percent for stocks, 0.1 percent for bonds, and 0.005 percent for derivatives. This means, for example, that a trade of $1,000 in stocks would be subject to a tax of $5. A trade of $1,000 in swaps or other derivatives would be subject to a tax of five cents.

>Even at such low rates, this plan would provide a huge benefit by reducing one particular type of trading that does not benefit our economy: high-frequency trading that rewards technological schemes rather than investing in productive businesses.

>For example, some traders have focused their energy on obtaining information about trades a fraction of a second before others, sometimes by locating their computers physically closer to where trades are happening. These computers then rush to buy or sell before others can respond, turning what would otherwise be a ripple in the market into a tidal wave that destabilizes the financial system.

>There is considerable precedence for this. The U.S had a Wall Street speculation fee from 1914 to 1966. And, today some 40 countries throughout the world have imposed a financial transactions tax including Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, China, India, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Brazil.

>More than 1,000 economists have endorsed a tax on financial speculation and 11 European countries have committed to enacting a financial transaction tax. This idea is also supported by more than 170 organizations in the U.S., including the AFL-CIO, National Nurses United, the National Organization for Women, NETWORK, Oxfam America, Public Citizen, the Sierra Club and many others.",Chartis,e9jgh5d,SandersForPresident
"I know what HFT trading is. Just because it disincentives it doesn't mean it doesn't reduce liquidity. HFT isn't even a bad thing. If you do want to reduce HFT, then taxing everyone .5% for making a trade will do it but cause so much harm on top of it. You could easily do something else like just limit the frequemcy of trades before putting in progressively jihher fees.

At .5% per, if you want to trade even once a month boom that's 6% of it gone. Twice a month is 12%, which would be all your gains. You'd be losing money because you'd get taxed on income on the years you come out ahead. That is barely even day trading level. (It isn't even 3 times a month actually...)

HFT will cease to exist, day trading will cease to exist, infrequent trading will be uncommon, anything but long term holds will be rare.

As there isn't a [CBO](https://twitter.com/StephanieKelton/status/908374836807905280) score yet we can see a broad overview. Instead of going through inefficient middle broker companies:   

Lessen the inefficiency and negotiate drug prices to save ~$600 billion. The tax reform costs companies and the 1% [(those making $719,000 or more)](https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2017) the overwhelming bulk of the $[1.6t](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all?inline=file). That's 2/3^rds (talking generally since we don't have exact scores yet).   

The other 1/3^rd is what the government already pays for health care, over $1t. 

When MFA passes much will be paid for by companies and the 1%. There will be better services for the same price because the the inefficiency and power imbalance will be reduced. Also everyone needs services like dental/mental/vision/pharmaceuticals and it's easier to manage & cheaper when done all together.  

If it's more (still likely a yuge boon) it's nice to know the financing isn't tied to the bill. So the tax strategy can be reevaluated even though like all other programs it comes out of general revenue. Bottom line is it will save lives, [improve satisfaction](http://www.asaging.org/sites/default/files/images/Brodie-Hamel-Norton-figure1.png), virtually eliminate paperwork, free up people to easier work where they wish, provide preventative care, cover dental, mental, vision, pharmaceuticals etc, alleviate the constant stress of worrying about personal medical costs, and [save](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFwMgK3XgAkODiq.jpg) the citizens [money](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFwP1nPVwAEWDVt.jpg).

They're going to be hitting Bernie on the ""old white man"" at every opportunity, even if Biden's who they're pushing instead, so if Bernie's allied himself with a younger woman of color, then they won't have a leg to stand on. To that end, Tlaib might just be the sleeper hit here: she's a strong progressive, Muslim, of Middle Eastern descent, and from Michigan, what's not to like?

She was a primary campaign surrogate for him, often appearing on television to make the case for his campaign and pushing progressive policies. She is now leading Bernie‚Äôs political organization, Our Revolution, as has been touring the country with him pushing for progressive candidates.

To take a small step back from their progressive bonafides for a moment, the fact that they‚Äôre both women of color is certainly a plus.

"They were doing the same exact shit to him in 2016. They don't want him in at all... They just don't like the fact that he's anti-establishment and an outsider. The media DOES collude, and they do work hard to assassinate people they don't want running. It's ran by super wealthy elites after all.

But I do agree he's too old... But unfortunately, I don't know a single other Democrat who passionately and genuinely cares about critical issues. A person who is able to convey that not only do they understand these issues, but they are top priority.

Every other politician just Reminds me of people like my local Jacky Rosen who literally just says they are for XYZ issues because that's what the focus group said ressonates with the base. They have no broad and genuine understanding of the issues other than them just being bullet points. Or Obama at best, who DOES understand the issues, but has no intent to actually make them a priority. They just know what people like to hear so they say it, but once in power, it's right back to business as usual.

Bernie is the only Dem I know who I feel like they understand and deeply care about the issues. The rest all just sounds like lip service. Mind you, I think Bernie's 15 an hour and a lot of his policy is a little extreme, but at least he's on the right track, and aware of the problems, as he's wanting to discuss the problems and confront them.

"The DNC and the GOP are largely similar. Economically they both favor corporations having power and control. They both place corporate executives or former leaders into their cabinets and chairs. 

The difference in the parties is social. The DNC will be more in favor of social liberalism as we saw with gay marriage recently. They are generally in favor of progressive lifestyles, *as long as doing so will not hurt established business/corporate interests.* Allowing gay marriage, for instance, did not cost anyone with major interests and stakes anything, so it was not stopped. Same with abortion rights and so forth. The GOP takes traditionally conservative stances on these issues.

Bernie and the progressive platform is the only economically left wing platform in the country. It is also socially left in most cases, and in fact in mostly ""do what you want as long as it isn't hurting other people"" hands-off to its roots. There is a lot of overlap with libertarianism here, and when you hear that Bernie's platform appeals to the right, it's often because of this. It defers heavily economically, where progressives strongly believe in government allocating the budget to provide the services that are required for life and a strong society to function. An example is universal healthcare for all: everyone will be sick, and a profit motive for healing them does not contribute to a strong society. DNC/GOP/Libertarians have differing views from this, with the former two acting in the interests of corporations like insurance and pharmacy (or whatever the topic is) and libertarians argue government should be completely divested from providing for people's needs since competition will lead to the greatest possible offering.

So there's no real ""this party is best"" and maybe not all candidates or platforms tick every box for you. There needs to be some balance, but currently, there is no real way to vote for economic left-wing policy or libertarian social policy. I think libertarians are gaining a lot of ground in more states election after election, including in Ohio where they outdid the greens.

Transitioning to clear energy saves the environment (important if you don‚Äôt want the species to die) will lower energy costs (good for the pocket book) and create jobs.

Universal healthcare is cheaper overall than private insurance. Any increase in taxes to pay for it would be less than you and your employer currently pay for premiums.

Social Security can be expanded by raising or eliminating the cap on taxable income (that way the rich don‚Äôt get out of paying their fair share)

"That‚Äôs frequently my point, there are basic tenets of the conservative ideology that aren‚Äôt let‚Äôs say wrong for lack of a better term right now. It‚Äôs just another way of looking at the world. And that‚Äôs awesome and diverse and brings variety to the political arena and could bring another point of view to the table when looking for solutions. BUT, if every racist and overall hater, call them nazis and/or KKK and/or NRA and/or white supremacist and/or Christian fundamentalist, flocks toward the GOP, there‚Äôs gotta be something fundamentally wrong there. You can accuse left wing extremists of tree huggers, hippies, socialists, Europeans, whatever you want. There‚Äôs typically no violence or hate involved. Think of the right wing extremists: driving over a pacific demonstration, sending bombs to people, killing innocents. Such a huge red flag that something is not right. And of course, not every conservative is like this. That‚Äôs an ignorant idiotic claim. But it is kinda true that let‚Äôs say a very large number of violent extremists are conservative. Think of last election. Be a conservative. Suddenly, nazi organizations endorse your candidate. Damn. Ok. Suddenly, KKK endorses your candidate. Damn. But ok ok. Suddenly you hear that every white supremacist in general is jumping of joy because of your candidate‚Äôs rhetoric and overall demeanor. Hot damn man. What do you need to see happen so you can just back off?! But then again. Easy for me to see. Not so easy for other people, otherwise those honest, hard working, smart, educated conservatives would‚Äôve done something other than voting for someone as despicable as Trump.

So what democrats have proposed is subsidizing education to get these people new, better, more modern jobs. The rust belters seem to have declined that because to them, their jobs are their way of life. To be a little less kind, there is nothing scarier to a conservative than change.

"> Pretty much anyone who would vote republican at this point will NEVER vote for a democrat

This isn't (and shouldn't be) about persuading conservatives to vote for Democrats. It's about mounting a cohesive movement against conservatives, one with the sort of super-majority required to overcome the hurdles of gerrymandering, voter suppression, unbridled campaign finance, and our two-party system.

We must draw a firm line between pushing hard for progressives within the party and allowing our internal squabbles to be used by Republicans to divide our vote and de-motivate progressive voters on Election Day. The time to push for progressives is before and during PRIMARIES. But we must never again allow Trump, the GOP, and their Russian sock puppet army to manipulate and fragment our vote and contribute to our own defeat.


",freediverx01,e9jw83c,SandersForPresident
Trump voters are reactionaries. They **liked** the dark (social) past and want to return to it. They're also stupid enough to blame their economic situation on immigrants and minorities. There's no reasoning with these people. They are the deplorables and their numbers are dwindling. ,freediverx01,e9od65u,SandersForPresident
"Hey, I'm with you, but it's also the moderates that need to wake up.  A message must be sent to the DNC and their PACs as well to stop undermining progressives.  Brent Welder KD district 3 is a perfect example, and there are others, where a PAC swoops in with boatloads of cash for no good reason other than to primary out a progressive for a corporate democrat who will play ball.

Corporate Democrats are only slightly better than the GOP, but a progressive or a socialist is leaps and bounds better than a corporate Dem.  I personally still vote for the lesser of evils in the general, but I'll never shame someone for voting third party when the DNC starts fucking with the primaries and picking republican-lite candidates.",ChiefnThatLoud,e9jwy8m,SandersForPresident
"We're in agreement on the sort of politicians we want. Where we differ is in the importance of taking a strategic view, and on the dangers of vilifying centrist Democrats in red states to the point where they lose to a Republican. I couldn't disagree more that a neoliberal Democrat is just as bad as a Neo-con Republican. The former is fighting to keep things the way they are (which is bad) while the latter is fighting to destroy everything we've accomplished in the last half century (which is infinitely worse.)

Do what you can to elect true progressives at the local and state levels and then go to the voting booth during primaries to support them. But never join hands with Republicans in their false equivalence arguments that gave us Trump over Hillary. Hillary would have sucked balls, but she would have been infinitely better than Trump and three branches of government controlled by the GOP.",freediverx01,e9k0be8,SandersForPresident
"I think of it this way.  The Manchin's of the world will turn on you when you need them the most, kind of like Lieberman (yeah, he was independent, whatever) caused the public option to fail.  Those ""red"" states are mostly red because of the uninspiring democratic candidates there.  The GOP has no new ideas, just an identity they sell.  But if the DNC can support more candidates that are exciting and offer things that those moderates are unwilling to put on the table, more people register, more people vote.  Like I said, you won't lose moderate republican votes, because those votes do not exist for democrats.  Moderate republicans either vote R when they're fired up, or they stay home when they aren't.  We need to fire up our base!

But yeah, the DNC still has a stranglehold on everything, and the PACs they are in league with do too.  There is much work to be done by supporting DSA, Justice Democrats and other orgs like Our Revolution.",ChiefnThatLoud,e9k0ucw,SandersForPresident
"> The Manchin's of the world will turn on you when you need them the most, kind of like Lieberman (yeah, he was independent, whatever) caused the public option to fail. 

Again, we're in total agreement that neoliberal Democrats are a big problem. But I still think you may be missing the broader picture that ""failing to pass the public option"", to use your example, was not nearly as bad as ""stacking the Supreme Court with with lifetime appointments of hard-right ideologues"" or ""passing a disastrous tax law that accelerated wealth and income inequality while paving the road for drastic future cuts to social services.""

I know it's a difficult concept, but we need to fight on two fronts at the same time ‚Äî pushing hard against centrists within the DNC, while taking back all three branches of government from the GOP. If we fail to accomplish the latter, the consequences will take decades to correct.

> Those ""red"" states are mostly red because of the uninspiring democratic candidates there.

I think that's definitely true in many districts, but not in all. Some parts of this country are hopelessly right-wing, and those areas will never elect a Democrat. The best we can hope in those cases may be to elect a centrist Democrat who will side with us at least some of the time. But of course there's disagreement over where to draw that line, and centrists in the DNC want to exploit that uncertainty to push for neoliberals in many places where they don't belong.

>1. Policies that get at the root causes of these inequities. 
>  * Expanding the social safety net

>2. Super-rich and multinational corporations have not been paying their fair share in taxes.

>  * raising the rates for the wealthiest Americans. 

>[Acknowledging Disparity of Wealth & Opportunity in America](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-economic-inequality/#acknowledging-disparity-of-wealth-and-opportunity-in-america): The rich get richer and the poor get poorer because of government policies that benefit the very few at the expense of the vast majority of Americans.

>[Fixing the Tax Code for Citizens, Corporations & Banks](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-economic-inequality/#fixing-the-tax-code-for-citizens-corporations-and-banks): Currently the super-rich and the largest corporations and banks in America don‚Äôt pay their fair share of taxes, which means there‚Äôs not enough funding for programs that will alleviate systemic inequalities.

>[Expanding the Social Safety Net & Increasing Access to Opportunity](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-economic-inequality/#expanding-the-social-safety-net-and-increasing-access-to-opportunity): Use revenue from progressive taxation to expand and create programs to help alleviate poverty and help Americans move forward and contribute to a more robust, equitable economy.

>[Creating & Keeping Better Jobs](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-economic-inequality/#creating-and-keeping-better-jobs): Increase the minimum wage so every working American can live rather than fight to survive, and create more well-paying jobs by putting people to work on our country‚Äôs crumbling infrastructure.

>[Reforming Broken Criminal Justice & Immigration Systems](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-economic-inequality/#reforming-broken-criminal-justice-and-immigration-systems): These systems perpetuate inequality, particularly among people of color, breeding crime and poverty instead of community and economic opportunity and must be revamped from the ground-up.

######Be The Press & Press The Press

>When people talk about how well we did with young people, clearly one of the reasons for that was our success with social media....

>Media is about what is not covered. The more important the issue is to large numbers of working people, the less interesting it is to corporate media. Issues being pushed by the top 1% get a lot of attention. My candidacy, alone, accounted for the majority of attention that network Sunday news shows paid to poverty, one of the great crises facing the nation. National television coverage ignores the reality of important parts of American life. Corporations have an agenda that serves their bottom line. In fact, that‚Äôs the reason for their existence. The largest media corporations are themselves owned by even larger conglomerates that have their own particular set of economic interests.  

>The extraordinary power of the multinational corporations provides billions of dollars a year in advertising revenue to the corporate owners of the media. These powerful corporations have an agenda. Six corporations control 90% of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy.  

>Demand that the media focuses on the real issues facing our nation and the world, not just political gossip. And if corporate media won‚Äôt change, and they won‚Äôt, start new media. The Internet offers revolutionary prospects.

######UN Recommendations:  

1. Acknowledge that America‚Äôs proudest achievement ‚Äìa vibrant democracy‚Äì is in peril unless steps are taken to restore the fabric from which it was crafted, including the adage that ‚Äòall are created equal‚Äô. 

2. Stop irrationally demonizing taxation and begin exploring how reasonable taxes can dramatically increase the social well-being of Americans and the country's economic competitiveness. 

3. Provide universal healthcare, as every other developed and many developing countries already do. This would rescue millions from misery, save money on emergency care, increase employment, and generate a healthier and more productive workforce.

"I don‚Äôt have all of the sources in front of me, but from what I have read, there isn‚Äôt any job loss due to raising the minimum wage. The increases are always phased in over time, so it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going to suddenly have to pay $6 more per hour out of nowhere. The loss due to paying higher wages is made up for by the in creased sales resulting from those in the community having more money to spend. The only short-term negative is that there‚Äôs sometimes a temporary cutback in work time while the companies figure out how to adjust to the wage change, but that sorts itself out quickly and everyone ends up working the same hours they did before.",WhoAteMyPasghetti,e9lu4lv,SandersForPresident

>Let me be absolutely clear: Donald Trump, Brian Kemp and Ron DeSantis ran racist campaigns. One ad the Republicans put out was even rejected by Fox television because of its racist content. They used racist rhetoric to divide people and advance agendas that would harm the majority of Americans.

>In Florida, Andrew Gillum, whom I was proud to stand with even during the primaries, faced week after week of racism from his opponent and allied forces. That's just a fact. And in the end, I believe those craven attacks founded in ""fear of the other"" had an impact on the outcome. Stacey Abrams faced similar attacks, in addition to unprecedented voter suppression. That's a reality that has to change.

>It is our job now to continue to offer an alternative to the hate-filled agenda of Trump and Republican operatives. We need to offer a vision that all people, regardless of their race or country of origin, are part of a shared destiny as one people.

Part of that effort is to be honest about what our divisive opponents are trying to accomplish and how it is tearing at the very fabric of our democracy and our common humanity.

",Chartis,e9gywm1,SandersForPresident
"As is said yes i'm really enthousiastic about an alliance with you guys in the US.

But the guy who you are talking about, Varoufakis, is as i said hostile to us, the actual progressive alliance in Europe. France Insoumise and Podemos did 20% last elections ...

The third article you posted is just false ... Varoufakis is nowhere leading anything, the most that he did is 6% in France. 

For the context in last election, the D25 affiliated party in France didn't backed up the progressive coalition, and doing so they ""offered"" french people a choice between Macron (a Clinton-like ""progressive"") and the fascist Lepen.

But as i read your article i don't see nowhere Bernie specifically mentioning Diem25. Varoufakis 
 talks too much. AMLO is a friend of Corbyn and Melenchon. so i don't know, we'll see.",Vingtmilles,e9gzcer,SandersForPresident
"Let us endeavor to work towards our mutual interests and be the leaders this world needs. Personalities and messaging may hinder global progress but the problems facing our world are no match for rational Humanists diplomatically & relentlessly pressing to our goals. Even if not in formal affiliation, grassroots around the world will be progressing side-by-side, forging our future.",Chartis,e9gzlns,SandersForPresident

2. Public Option: Give everyone the option of choosing either private insurance *or* Medicare/Medicaid. This solution keeps private insurance in the game, but makes them compete with the govt options.

3. Obamacare/Romneycare: Make private insurance mandatory. This solution not only keeps private insurance in the game, it expands their business.

"Triangulation was a survival strategy IMO.  Once the GOP was able to fracture the Roosevelt coalition, southern social conservatives suddenly became open to neo-liberal economic arguments, and those arguments won HARD with the boomers over the next couple of decades.  

Progressivism was basically dead in the water until the emergence of a new large generation came up.  A generation that grew up with the internet and couldn't as easily be convinced by neo-lib propaganda since they were more connected to the world outside the U.S.  

With rather remarkable ease young Millennials could start an AIM chat discussion with someone from Norway and hear their opinion on their healthcare system,or watch a YouTube video about students in France where they'd learn they don't pay tuition, or get into a twitter argument with someone from Australia who lets them know everything is perfectly fine their without guns.


Progressives have an opportunity now to win the argument for the long-term, kinda like neo-libs did in the second half of the 20th century.  But they have to keep sticking to issues and be very careful how far they go in attacking Trump.  As bad as he is, a lot of supporters are going to take it very personally if he is not handled with great care, and the middle may start to believe this idea that the media is being unfair to him and the democrats/justice-dept are engaging in witch-hunts.",theDarkAngle,e9etd2q,SandersForPresident
"Looking at actual policy implementation tends to be more a more effective way of measuring a party but alright.

&#x200B;

What I was talking about is more the societal structure of the countries to begin with and their parties pull in any direction from that. For instance, Merkle's Germany is built upon a mix of Democratic Corporatism/socialism in the original context, i.e. Tripartite bargaining between state, union and business. This is a political norm, both sides of the aisle take it as a given of the german political context. Another example is that people in Germany believe universal healthcare is a right.  I'm not saying other countries dont have their nutters, and MMP can certainly deliver nutjobs in the fringe, but they tend to stay fringe.  


However, the fact Trump stays as popular as he does, and has the support from the republican party like he does, represent to me a divergence from the intellectual roots of the republican party that is both racist and somehow also elitist, even while being supported by the poorer ignorant segments of America.

She has and always will care more about protecting those than beating Trump.

Yes! That‚Äôs the whole point! We desperately need a restructuring of our country. We currently allow millions to live in poverty despite being the richest country the world has ever known. Thousands of people die every year because they don‚Äôt have insurance. A government that allows that to happen clearly needs to be restructured.

The largest dozen or so states have most of the US population, but I can‚Äôt think of a single policy where the largest states would all agree on one position while the smallest states would all agree on the opposite position. In all honesty, if you could get the wildly differing electorates of Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, California and Florida to agree on something, then it must be what the nation wants.

The reason the senate worked was that the federal government was supposed to be seriously limited it what I handled and each state was supposed to do it.

As for the the parliamentary system, there is no Supreme Court, there is no chief executive to sign off on things. The ruling party of parliament controls everything.

‚ÄúStates rights‚Äù is a dumb concept that deserves to be wrecked, especially considering the fact that there isn‚Äôt a single politician that genuinely believes in the concept. They all only believe in ‚Äúrights‚Äù for the states whose governments are controlled by their party.

How?

It would be easier to have a federal universal healthcare system because the patient pool would be larger. Common sense gun laws work great until people realize they can just drive to the next state over which doesn‚Äôt have those laws and easily access firearms. Many parts of states‚Äô electoral systems, such as which day elections must be conducted as well as the manner in which they elect their Representatives (from single member districts), are determined by the federal government. States also can‚Äôt do anything to eliminate the electoral college.

> As for the the parliamentary system, there is no Supreme Court

I‚Äôm not sure where you got the idea that nations with parliamentary systems don‚Äôt have courts. I‚Äôm also not sure why you seem to think that the Supreme Court is some kind of savior of Democracy. Our federal judiciary is packed full of partisan hacks that constantly toe the party line. Many nations with parliamentary systems don‚Äôt have that problem because they have an independently appointed judiciary.

> The ruling party of parliament controls everything. Meaning if the party has a majority, then that party does whatever they want. 

You mean like the past 2 years, when Republicans have controlled all 3 branches of government?

> I'd be ok with a parliamentary set up if we had more than 2 parties or at least if the two parties were significantly less volatile. 

You have the wrong order of operations here. If we had multiple parties already, there wouldn‚Äôt be much needed to transition into a more parliamentary form of government. To have those new parties rise up, we first need to change the way they are elected.

I posted two articles today where I tried to strike a balance with the headlines here:  

* [Brianna Titone declares victory as Colorado‚Äôs first transgender lawmaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/9vy8rk/brianna_titone_declares_victory_as_colorados/) | ""knock on a lot of doors and focus on the voters‚Äô needs and what they need for a legislator""  

* [17 Black Women Sweep to Judgeships in Texas County](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/us/black-female-judges-texas-election.html) | ""our election will usher in courts that ensure an equal opportunity for justice for all‚Äù  

But just because I'm vocal doesn't mean I represent everyone. I encourage everyone to raise their voices, and to do so in support of what you like as well. That's often overlooked here on Reddit (& the internet).  

Reddit has a W I D E reach though our demographics, while diverse and skew to the marginalized, do tend to be low-income young Caucasian males. Having this conversation helps connect us, give us some vision, and prods us to become aware.  

As an example of one 'identity' [Shaun King](https://www.sandersinstitute.com/about/fellows) has recently got overwhelming support to restart [The North Star](https://www.thebeatdc.com/blog/2018/11/7/shaun-king-relaunches-the-north-star) and recommends [The Appeal](https://theappeal.org). It's that sort of purpose driven messaging that I think is really beneficial.  

I'll close with [Emily Ratajkowski's introduction for Bernie on Feb 15^th 2016](https://www.facebook.com/Officialemilyratajkowski/videos/846785232099639/):  

>It is insane to be here and feel the momentum in this room. I can't tell you how special this is for me. I'm a young woman and I'm here because I support Bernie Sanders, I'm not here for the *bros*. 

>I have seen symbolism in elections, symbolism that so desperately fails the people who so desperately needed the action to make change. I want my first female President to be more than a symbol.  

>Bernie Sanders is offering the action we desperately need. His economic solution will provide for those who suffer from the oppression of a broken system. Including women.  

>Bernie has the freedom from the private interests and big corporations to give families the extra childcare, time off for maternity leave, and pay equality. Actions that affect women directly. 

>Bernie understands the importance of addressing inequality in a flawed economic system. We are here because we know that Bernie can bring real change. He can create a country that does not incarcerate more than it educates. A country with a demilitarized police force. One where we do not allow young Black men to be murdered without accountability. He gives us hope for equality.  

>We haven't had a candidate like Bernie Sanders in a long time and we might not see the likes of him again. This is our moment. This is the time. 

>I've been so impressed by the Sanders campaign. He's remained so dignified in an insane political climate. And in doing so he's reminded us that this election is certainly not about the gender of the candidate.  

>This is about a chance for a real change. One that will effect each and every American. This is about our future, a future we can believe in.

For instance, in NJ we had a choice between Menendez (Uber corrupt Democrat) and Hugin (marginally corrupt ""independent""). Hugin spent the entire campaign season saying he wasn't going to be another rubber stamp senator for Trump. 2 weeks before the election, Trump starts campaigning for him. Hugin went from a roughly 3% lead to 10% behind. He finished just shy of 10% behind.

But the important statistic is that in exit polls 7 out of 10 voters said they voted for Menendez, despite the corruption, because they wanted someone they could trust to oppose Trump.

"You are correct that one, individual vote will never effect an election as a whole. 
However, you forget that the action of voting is very rarely an individual action that merely causes a single effect. Look at it this way; lets say you vote, and in doing so you impart the importance of voting to just 5 of your friends and convince them that they need to vote. You explain how important elections are, how they are the staple of our republic, and how we as Americans have a civic duty to take part in our political system. So now, we have 6 people voting (including yourself). Lets say that your five friends, in turn, convince five others to vote. Suddenly you have 26 votes cast. Then the cycle continues. And it all of that began because one individual cast their ballot and convinced others to do the same. Politics (and by extension voting, as it the core of what makes a democratic republic) is rarely if ever an individual event. The concept of ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù only occurs when groups of people get together and work towards a common goal. Your theory/idea that the act of an individual voting ends with the ballot being counted isnt realistic. Furthermore, in the state of NC (my home state) in the 2016 election, there was a state judge who lost his race by only 300 votes. Had enough individuals felt the desire to vote and seen the importance, then the entire judicial system of a district could have been incredibly different

Also, you are horribly incorrect when you say that other political actions (ie, calling representatives, rallying, etc...) are more important than voting. Those actions only matter when they lead to voting. You could have 1 million individuals contact their representatives, but if they do not vote then it means absolutely nothing. I am saying this as someone who has gone to rallies, who does call their representatives, and who is very politically active. Voting is the single most important act a citizen can provide for their country, because it is the only peaceful action a citizen can take to truly enact change. if you call your rep and tell them you dont vote, then they will not listen to a single thing you are saying, because you are removing yourself from the democratic process

Cynicism does not entail truth. The fact that you are espousing an unpopular opinion does not mean that you are right. It just means that you disagree with people.

"Just a reminder for those who live in California that the Assembly District Delegate elections for the California Democratic Party are coming up in January.  Progressives won approximately 60% of the seats throughout all of California in 2017 and it was thought that this was enough to take over the California Democratic Party.  However, due to super delegates and other establishment shenanigans the party was able to keep Eric Bauman as the party chair.  In 2017 there was an app developed to help organize progressives throughout all of California to at least vote in these elections and also to help anyone who wanted to run.  I hope this organizing process is repeated in 2019 and that enough folks vote so that progressives take over the largest democratic state party in the nation.  I'm 99% sure I'm going to run for a seat (the only way I won't is if there is already enough stronger progressives ready to fill a full slate).

"> **First impressions from Election Night? Most encouraging result, least encouraging?**
My impression is that, given the fact that Trump fired [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions today in order to remove media coverage from [Tuesday] night tells me we had a pretty good night. I think [Tuesday] night was a significant rejection of Trumpism. Not only did the Democrats regain control of the House, which was the most important development, Democrats won seven governors‚Äô races. Democrats won 300 races at the state legislative and in the four states that Trump won in order to get his Electoral College majority ‚Äî Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan ‚Äî all four of those Senate Democratic candidates won. And three out of the four [Democratic] candidates for governor won. As someone who worked very hard for Andrew Gillum, that was a major disappointment. He ran a brilliant campaign, dealing with a lot of things, including racism. We‚Äôll see what happens in Georgia, whether or not they‚Äôre going to count all the votes there. But if Abrams loses, that [will be] a painful loss.

> **Do you have any plans to oppose what happened in Georgia?**
I will add my voice and do what I can! Bottom line there: We are aware of the absurdity of this guy Kemp, who is the Secretary of State, counting the votes. [He] happens to be her opponent. The demand has got to be that every bloody vote has got to be counted. I will add my voice and do everything I can to make sure that happens.

> **The Washington Post had an op-ed suggesting this means no ‚Äúfire-breathing‚Äù progressives going forward, no liberals, that the way forward is moderates ‚Äî**
[Laughs] Matt, I am really shocked by this! I cannot believe that that is their conclusion, given that they have been spouting that absurd line forever, and that was the line that they had which enabled Republicans to gain control of the Senate and the House and the White House and for Democrats to lose almost 1,000 seats in the previous nine years. Of course, that‚Äôs what the establishment will say, and that‚Äôs what the establishment Democrats will say. But the truth is that what has happened in this election is a significant step forward in terms of the revitalization of American democracy. It wasn‚Äôt moderate democrats or conservative Democrats who got young people into the political process. It wasn‚Äôt moderate Democrats who increased voter turnout in this election compared to four years ago, I think by almost 50 percent.
It wasn‚Äôt just moderate Democrats who won incredibly great victories for the House. There were some moderates, to be sure. But I think the Washington Post is going to be very surprised at who shows up on the first day of Congress and gets sworn in, because that is going to be the most progressive freshman class in the modern history of the United States. Many of these folks are not just women, not just people of color, who campaigned on Medicare-for-all, raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks, campaigned on making public colleges and universities tuition-free, of undoing Trump‚Äôs tax breaks for billionaires. The political establishment notwithstanding, the future belongs to progressives.

> **Earlier you mentioned Attorney General Sessions. Obviously you served with him in the Senate. Do you have any thoughts about his legacy as Attorney General, or the meaning of this firing?**
I would just reiterate that Trump knows how to manipulate the media and that it‚Äôs not an accident that he fired Sessions today, not tomorrow, not the next day. Because he wanted to divert attention from what happened Tuesday night. Sessions did Trump‚Äôs bidding. Did his bidding on criminal justice ‚Äî terrible. Did his bidding on immigration ‚Äî terrible. Did his bidding on a number of areas. On the one hand, the resentment that Trump obviously had toward Sessions is that he recused himself in terms of the Mueller investigation, which was the right thing to do. And Trump never forgave him. The key question right now is whether or not Trump will attempt to impede the Mueller investigation. And that must not be allowed to happen. Congress has got to pass legislation to protect that investigation. However, if Trump goes forward and tries to impede it, that is in my mind an obstruction of justice, which is an impeachable offense. So we have to do everything we can in every way to make sure that investigation goes forward. 

> **Do you have any thoughts about the leadership in the House?**
I will let them work that out themselves. I‚Äôm obviously not a member of the House anymore. We‚Äôll let them make their own decisions. But this is what I absolutely do believe. I absolutely believe that from day one, the Democrats in the House have got to come out with a progressive agenda that speaks to the needs of working people. And that leads to ‚Äî as you know, the Medicare-for-all bill I introduced, which is to be implemented over four years, lowers the eligibility age from 65 to 55, covers all of the children, and lowers the cost of prescription drugs. My guess is that about 80-percent of the American people would support a proposal like that. It‚Äôs wildly popular. And that‚Äôs what the Democrats have got to do. They‚Äôve got to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour, they‚Äôve got to make public colleges tuition-free and they‚Äôve got to lower student debt. All of these proposals are enormously popular. And they‚Äôre good public policy. And here‚Äôs what I think, Matt, that maybe nobody else in the world believes. As you know, Trump is a 100-percent political opportunist, who has no political views other than how he can win elections.

> **Well, that‚Äôs true.**
Today, if he is a racist and a sexist, tomorrow he may be a great civil rights champion ‚Äî if he thinks it gets him five more votes. He has no core values. I would not be shocked that if the Democrats passed popular, good legislation, that Trump would look around him and say, ‚ÄúHey, why not? What do I give a damn?‚Äù And he may come on board, because ultimately he doesn‚Äôt believe in anything except winning. So I believe it‚Äôs terribly important that the Democrats come out of the gate full-steam ahead and start passing really good legislation that puts Trump and the Republicans on the defensive.

> **So far what I‚Äôve been reading about the intention of the Democrats in the House is that much of it is focused on investigations; we have 64 subpoenas we want to drop, and ‚Äî**
Wrong!

> **Wrong?**
Look, people can chew bubble gum and walk at the same time. Democrats can do that. And if all they‚Äôre going to do is investigate Trump, that would be, in my view a very, very serious mistake. I think finally we are going to have oversight over Trump‚Äôs behavior. And I think investigations are absolutely appropriate. But simultaneously, people who are making $11 an hour are not worrying about investigations. People who have no health care, or can‚Äôt afford prescription drugs, are not worried about subpoenas. People who can‚Äôt afford to send their kids to college are not worried about another investigation. So it would be a tragic mistake in my view if all the Democrats did is focus on investigations. They must, must, must go forward with a progressive agenda to win the support of the American people.

> **Because ‚Äî**
Because it‚Äôs not an either/or. Investigation, oversight: terribly important. But they have got to come forward with a progressive agenda for working people.

> **And they have to do that, presumably, before the 2020 presidential race begins?**
They have to do it on day one. They can start working on it. I‚Äôll work with them. But we‚Äôve got to do that on day one.",TheSwampDweller,e9d8g90,SandersForPresident

That is obscene beyond belief. 95% of all new income in this country went to the top 1%.

"Big picture: The Medicaid expansion has gone from covering fewer than half the states to covering almost four-fifths.

The lesson? When it comes to health care, voters value a program that is broad and simple. They want premiums and deductibles and other forms of cost-sharing to be minimized. And they'd rather avoid the grind of dealing with the insurance market. They just want security and reliability. That's the sort of policy they will reward at the polls.

That is, of course, a case for continuing to expand Medicaid. But it's also a case for Medicare-for-all, which would provide all those benefits to every single American voter.

Now, both Jason and Waldo's events are being held at the same place supposedly, and maybe you can show up, and it'll just be a bunch of people there for the same reason, and it'll be fine.

This implies my posts are illegitimate because I don't have an established post history. It's an ad hominem attack intended to discredit me, plain and simple.

Well the facts are, I'm not from Russia, and the age of my account has nothing to do with the quality of my posts. My username was auto-generated by Reddit, so that's probably why it looks so similar to others.

I don't even know how to respond to your claim about 'similar content', it's just another attack on my character, rather than my message. No comment or post of mine is the same as anyone else's. You can't argue with facts, and evidence can you?

Here's the other part:

[Here are the rules of this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandersforpresident/wiki/rules) you violated with this part of your post:

Rule 1: Be Civil
- Because you called me 'juvenile and out-of-touch'

Rule 2: No Trolling (This includes any user who come comes to /r/SandersForPresident to be repetitively disagreeable)
- Because your point was already made by another user, and then you doubled down **without contributing anything**
>  ^ 5-day-old account with autogenerated username and one ‚Äúwhat about liberals!‚Äù-style post

Rule 3: Unproductive, Off-Topic and Low-Context Submissions
- Because **I'm a real user** your comment is most certainly Unproductive, Off-Topic and Low-Context

Rule 7: Conspiracy Theories and Fear Mongering Are Prohibited (The following is prohibited: Any post or public statement which spreads fear, intimidation, or unease but either has no direct or clear benefit to the greater goals of the sub or is intended to coerce subscribers into behaving or engaging in any way that they would not have done otherwise.)
- The only way to interpret your post is that I'm not a genuine person, and I'm part of a 'troll farm' somewhere. You're trying to convince people to be **afraid** I'm not legitimate, in order to discredit my posts without actually addressing them directly. 


> Nope. Ad hominem means it's baseless. I already mentioned what I based it on - the similarity of your account to others known to be illegitimate. If you are legitimate, sorry.

You should be sorry. [Ad hominem](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ad%20hominem) does not mean it's baseless:

1 : appealing to feelings or prejudices rather than intellect
an ad hominem argument

2 : marked by or being an attack on an opponent's character rather than by an answer to the contentions made
made an ad hominem personal attack on his rival

> the similarity of your account to others known to be illegitimate.

You've provided **ABSOLUTELY** no proof of this. It's based on your opinion, and you're putting me in a bucket with other people you disagree with because it's easier than discussing facts or providing evidence. It's disgusting.

">Look, people can chew bubble gum and walk at the same time. Democrats can do that. And if all they‚Äôre going to do is investigate Trump, that would be, in my view a very, very serious mistake. I think finally we are going to have oversight over Trump‚Äôs behavior. And I think investigations are absolutely appropriate. But simultaneously, people who are making $11 an hour are not worrying about investigations. People who have no health care, or can‚Äôt afford prescription drugs, are not worried about subpoenas. People who can‚Äôt afford to send their kids to college are not worried about another investigation. So it would be a tragic mistake in my view if all the Democrats did is focus on investigations. They must, must, must go forward with a progressive agenda to win the support of the American people.

The key question right now is whether or not Trump will attempt to impede the Mueller investigation. That must not be allowed to happen. Congress has got to pass legislation to protect that investigation. If Trump goes forward and tries to impede it, that is an obstruction of justice, which is an impeachable offense. We have to do everything we can in every way to make sure that investigation goes forward.

"I don't think Sherrod is exciting enough for a nationwide race. 

I still think it will even be tough for him to win Ohio against Trump. 

It looked as though there were 185k more votes for Sherrod than his opponent. But those numbers don't match for the governors race. Republicans missed an opportunity to steal Sherrod's seat. They were so focused on the governor's race, they didn't have a strong candidate. Mandel dropping out was bad, but he was bad in the first place. If they had Mary Taylor run for senate instead of governor, I think it would've been a lot closer. She had support during the primary and was Kasich's LT governor. 

That being said. There is a lot that goes into a presidental run that Bernie has been laying the groundwork for 2 years. Sherrod outside of Ohio is a problem. Beto is interesting. But a Sanders/O'Rourke ticket would still have the same issues that Sanders/(White Person) will have.

"Ohio went blue for Obama both times he ran.

Ohio is not a dyed in the wool red state like Wyoming or Montana ",Abuddend,e9c79r0,SandersForPresident
"I think that is because Sherrod Brown is actually well liked in Ohio. He is seen as a working man moderate when his voting record is actually won if the most liberal out there. In a state full of people that increasingly views the Democratic party as looking down on them, Ohioans see him as someone who understands them. 

That being said, I'm gonna say hell no on Gabbard. Literally the only reason why people support her here is that she endorsed Bernie in 2016. Her foreign policy views are absolutely godawful. She opposed the Iran deal, is obsessed with ""radical Islam"" and was one of the few Democrats who said we needed to emphasize the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" more,  she is an Assad apologist who has said she was skeptical he was behind the chemical attacks, and she has supported a number of the increasing number of far-right world leaders.

She has refused to debate opponents in primary debates (something she criticized Clinton for doing) and I don't trust her on abortion and LGBT rights saying that ""As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists."" In her defense, she  has ""changed"" her views recently. I put that in quotes because what she actually said is that her views remain the same, just that she no longer believes the government should enforce her views. I may accept that from someone on the right, but not from someone who claims to be a progressive.

I don't know enough about Turner, but I don't think ""Endorsed Bernie in 2016"" is the key qualifier for someone to be a running mate.

Kentucky might have more of a chance but I can‚Äôt speak more authoritatively on it. 

The fact is that Ohio is a battleground state for a reason, a bellwether state, and often is a linchpin for Republican candidates. Calling it solid red ignores its history, demographics and diversity. I certainly understand the frustration felt by liberals and progressives here, being one.

Primary wise, Ohio probably won't be a high value state, so Bernie likely won't be here a lot. So it will be left to the State party, which is trash.

I said it before and I will say it again. If Bernie doesn't pick an AA running mate, he won't have a chance in Ohio. White male vs white male in this state is a loss every time for Dems.

"I think this article is worthless.  I get that voter suppression is a big deal.  

But IMO there's no reason to think a medicare for all - national ID would fix the issue.  

First, we have plenty of situations where ID's are around and it doesn't translate to automatic registration.  In most states, getting a drivers license, or getting a student ID, or getting a military ID, or enrolling in a government program all don't lead to automatic voter registration.  

Second - while I think in most states voter registration is about making it harder to vote - it does serve two other purposes:

* Validating that you're eligible to vote - a national ID might help to some extent here - who you are, but each state sets their own eligibility requirement, but that's not to say red states wouldn't put in a difficult process past the national ID to prove you're eligible to vote - ie proving you're a citizen and non-felon (if ID's are given to non citizens).

* Validating your address (where you vote) - Again - a national ID might be nice to have, but what happens when you move?  Do you get your ID updated each and every time?  How difficult is this process?  Again - having a national ID that doesn't reflect your current address just seems like another reason red states could make up to invalidate voter registration.  


I think it's a giant leap to assume that medicare for all = national ID's for all, and that every red state will all the sudden adopt automatic voter registration and make it easy to vote with that national ID.  ",etown361,e9agkdp,SandersForPresident

According to Sanders: 7.5% by employers and 4% by households.  But this is likely a huge underestimate.  

$3.2 trillion per year?  That's pretty much the entire amount of income taxes collected by the IRS annually.  So one could fund Medicare For All with income taxes, just take your tax bill and double it.

In 2015 Vermont looked at single payer - at an additional 12.5% payroll tax plus another 9.5 % state income tax, and balked. Vermont's plan was not as generous as the M4A plan by Sanders.

The third way Democrats are better than something.

The thing that the third way Democrats are better than is the Republicans, even the Republicans in the 'far left' of the Republican party (the term 'far left' is used somewhat sardonically here). 

"" who are a regressive minority in a party of a majority illiberal fascists.""

The so-called 'far left' Republicans are actually regressives, but trivially less so than the outright fascists who comprise the majority of the party.  

In short, the writer notes that even the least regressive Republicans are far worse than even the least progressive Democrats.  I support progressive Democrats and want to see Pelosi removed as speaker, but I certainly agree.

"I think gun control is a losing issue relentlessly pushed by a corporate media that benefits from the constant conflict. Two things:

1. Cities with the strictest gun control laws have the highest incidents of violent crime (New York, Chicago, & Los Angeles). 

2. The government has never successfully banned anything. In fact, Prohibition only leads to lower prices and more supply.

Common sense things like the universal background checks and closing the gun show loophole make sense to me, but I don't know how anyone thinks a billion firearms will just disappear when the government decides. I don't see the benefit in pretending like black markets don't exist.

">I am glad to hear that voters in three states voted to legalize marijuana, and one voted to decriminalize it outright. Millions of Americans have had their lives impacted by the federal prohibition on marijuana ‚Äì arrests, convictions and even jail time. Even when people don‚Äôt go to jail, the criminal record they receive makes it harder for them to find a job, get housing or go to college. These harmful impacts are felt far more acutely in communities of color and poor communities because enforcement of marijuana laws is much stricter there than in more affluent, white communities. African Americans are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana even though marijuana usage rates are basically the same across racial lines. Of course, marijuana prohibition is part of a larger failed war on drugs that has led to the great national crisis of mass incarceration. Some 1.5 million people were arrested for a drug related offense in 2016 ‚Äì over 80 percent of which were for possession alone. We need to stop criminalizing addiction. We need to stop criminalizing recreational marijuana use. The actions voters made in states across the nation are a step in the right direction.

"context:

If you ever need a reminder that the CIA was founded and run by lawyers, you won't need to look any further than the overthrow of Guatemalan democracy. The Dulles brothers were partners in the Wall Street law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell; time permitting, they also worked for the US government. With John Foster Dulles heading the State Department and Allen Dulles heading the CIA, they were the czars of Eisenhower's foreign policy, and they made sure that the interests of Sullivan & Cromwell clients weren't ignored.
In 1951, Jacobo Arbenz was elected president of Guatemala by a landslide in a free and fair election. He hoped to transform Guatemala ""from a backward country with a predominantly feudal economy to a modern capitalist state."" The CIA, however, weighed in heavily on the side of feudalism.

When Arbenz appropriated some unused land controlled by the Rockefeller-owned United Fruit Company (for which United Fruit was duly compensated), the company undertook an extensive PR campaign in the US, designed to paint Arbenz as a tool of the ""international Communist conspiracy."" John Foster Dulles, ever alert for opportunities to roll back the red menace-and to help out a valued client-convinced Ike that Arbenz must go. [By the way, ""United Fruit Company"" is the actual origin of the term, ""Banana Republic.""]

Brother Allen's CIA was only too happy to take the job, which ended up costing only about $20 million. The agency sponsored a propaganda offensive and hired about 300 mercenaries who sporadically sabotaged trains and oil supplies.


Finally, in June of 1954, unmarked CIA planes staged a series of air raids on the Guatemalan capital and dropped leaflets demanding Arbenz's resignation. At the same time, CIA-run radio stations warned of the impending invasion of an occupying rebel army (actually the agency's 300 hired thugs). Considering discretion the better part of valor, Arbenz fled, leaving Guatemala in the hands of the CIA's hand-picked stooge, General Castillo Armas.

The CIA has always been particularly proud of the Guatemalan operation, which inaugurated a series of bloodthirsty regimes that murdered more than 100,000 Guatemalans over the next 40 years. In retrospect, however, some CIA veterans concluded that it may have come off too easily, leading to a certain overconfidence. **As one CIA officer put it, ""We thought we could knock off these little brown people on the cheap.""**

They can somehow look past all of the other issues that are important (blatant racism, voter suppression, immigration, environment, health care, education...I could go on for awhile). 

The point is to not let your political affiliations define you to the point to where you no longer can think independently for yourself. I see it and it is sickening.

">Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media.  People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids - all while the very rich become much richer. 

>To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him.  

-Senator Sanders Statement on Trump, [Nov 9^th 2016](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-statement-on-trump)

>Trump is something different who will do anything, say anything in order to gain power. And while he's dividing us up he's busy giving tax breaks to the rich and trying to throw millions of people off the health insurance that they have.  

>It is imperative we rally the American people not only against Trump but around a progressive agenda which demands that government works for all of us, not just wealthy campaign  contributors.

My takeaway: For 2020 Bernie prioritizes the defeat of Trump over all else and it sounds like he will only run if he feels he is the one with the best chance of doing that. With that in mind he closely watches the engagement for his videos etc on facebook and twitter.

">* Life expectancy for women has declined over the past 20 years in 313 U.S. counties.  
>* People in the highest income group can expect to live, on average, at least 6.5 years longer than those in the lowest income group.  
>* Adult men and women who have graduated from college can expect to live at least 5 years longer than people who have not finished high school.  
>* In 2009, the mortality rate for African American infants was over twice that of white infants.
>* As a nation we have 6 million more people living in poverty than we did in 2004.
>* In the United States in 2000, 133,000 people died due to poverty.  

>Reducing poverty in America is a major challenge, that will require efforts on many fronts. Because disparities in health care access and utilization exist even after controlling for insurance coverage, ensuring access to health coverage for all is an important step, but will not by itself solve the problem. Addressing non-financial barriers to health, such as transportation, child care, primary school education, and safe housing, to name a few, must be considered when discussing efforts to improve health for millions of low-income Americans.

>At a time when the numbers of people dying in this country due to poverty rival that of those dying of preventable diseases, more attention must be paid to socioeconomic disparities.

-Sen. Sanders, Sept 13^th '11: [The Human Cost of Socieconomic Disparities.](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/IsPovertyADeathSentence.pdf) 

>There is very little discussion about these major crises, and even less discussion about ideas that can resolve these issues.

>And this is not just a crisis within the political establishment -- it‚Äôs certainly a crisis within the media establishment, because media seems to be far more concerned about looking at politics as a game, or looking at personality and celebrity life.  

>1. The growing disparity in income and wealth that exists in America. We are in a situation where we have not been since the late 1920s, before the Depression, where the top 1% owns 38% of the financial wealth of America, while the bottom 60% ‚Äì six zero ‚Äì owns 2.3% of the wealth in America. That is obscene beyond belief. 95% of all new income in this country went to the top 1%.

>  It is very dangerous to our political system. Because big money interests are putting huge amounts of money into the political process through Citizens United. And these are issues that have got to be addressed, or else in my view the United States will move very rapidly toward an oligarchic form of society when our economic and political life is controlled by a handful of billionaires.  

>  I see this as a huge moral issue, an economic issue, a political issue. There is virtually no discussion about that, virtually none. I don‚Äôt know how we can be a serious nation when this issue is not front and center, and there are not real ideas out there on how we address it.  

>2. Global warming is man-made, that it is already causing disastrous problems, and that those problems will only get worse in years to come -- that we have almost no movement at all, virtually no movement in Congress on this planetary crisis.

>3. Cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid: inside the Beltway, in the political establishments, there is support for cuts to those terribly important programs.

And he organized the Unity Reform Commission of the DNC as well. On top of all that he's a family man and an author. He's a very busy guy and only endorses people he personally knows as far as I can tell. I'm gratefully Bernie has the time to endorse anybody, let alone campaign across the nation for some of them. I trust his delegation. If Our Revolution, James Zogby personally, and NNU say he's worth supporting. That's aces in my book. That he's in favor of Medicare For All and not Ted Cruz is superb as well. ",Chartis,e93oz92,SandersForPresident

"Honestly, if you look at how the voting went, there were four states where Trump won by extremely slim margins to get him the electorate votes needed to win. In those places he won by less than the number of people that supported Bernie Sanders that voted for Trump. 

While the voter turnout was, as normal for the US, abysmal, Hillary would have been better off if those people *had* stayed home. The chances of them actually being Democrats that voted agains their party for Trump was pretty slim, those were probably people that were ""having trouble deciding"" aka Bernie supporters that were actually Republicans. 

The game these days is divide and conquer. Both party's loyals will split to their side and then the propaganda can work to try and sway those few left without a ""side"".

"I didn't used to, but it's become increasingly more clear in the decade since I reached adulthood that the Republican party is objectively more evil and blatantly corrupt than the Democrats.

If you consider actual criminal indictments of just members of the executive branch over the past ~50 years, the Republicans have over 150 to the Democrats' 19. That's *8 times* as many.

Reagan's trickle-down bullshit that the right has been pushing despite clear failure for over 30 years is directly responsible for the fact that the ""richest nation on earth"" has more poverty and wealth inequality than almost any of its peers. 

The right ignores and denies science and pushes hypocritical theocratic bullshit all the time.

The right wing creates international enemies and more terrorism through their neoconservative global conquests.

The right promotes corporate freedoms while stifling individual freedoms.

The right has been selling out working Americans for personal gain for decades.

I could go on and on, but the point is that while the Democrats certainly have rampant corruption in their ranks, there are a steadily growing number of decent, pro-middle class anti-corporatist Democrats. On the other hand, the Republicans cannot reject corruption at this point because they have literally incorporated it into the philosophy of their party. Their slogans and soundbites are designed to make their voters comfortable with giving up their power and money so that corporate interests may have more of it. We spent more on corporate welfare for the rich than we do on social welfare for the poor.

""Both sides are the same"" is literally right-wing propaganda designed to keep disillusioned liberals home on voting day. Republicans, no matter how vile their candidates are, don't get disillusioned because they've been brainwashed for decades that liberals are America's #1 enemy, and they should vote for a massively corrupt Republican over a spooky, evil ""communist"" liberal.

Kudos to Bernie for being so industrious in addition to his solid work as a Senator. He's revitalizing American democracy by leading a political revolution and doin' a damn fine job. I'm grateful for his efforts and am glad for his thoughts & his books. In addition to what he shared during the time he spent in the AMA (which was more then he spent that day on TYT & MSNBC combined) providing his thoughts for free, I'm really interested in where we go from here.

"Funny how you resort to twisting my words around into a strawman.

No, my solution is not not voting.

I'm refuting the naive concept that voting solves all problems, that voting is the end all to everything, that all it takes is voting, that ""What happens next is all up to us,"" because it's not all fucking up to us. If you're black, and in the South, there's a good fucking chance that white republicans are fucking you over, more so than you would be if you were black anywhere else in the US. 

As I already mentioned:

* We vote, but the popular vote isn't how we pick a president.
* We vote, but states have winner-take-all, which means your vote is invalidated no matter if you're republican or democrat.
* We vote, but our votes are invalidated and replaced with representative votes in the electoral college.
* We vote, and states like Vermont where the popular vote went for Bernie but all the superdelagate votes went for fucking HRC.

See my point?? It's that it takes more than ""just voting"" to make a difference. I don't know what it takes, maybe it takes more money, or special interest, or getting more people to vote or god fucking forbid it takes violence to make change; I don't know. But what I do know is that it takes more than one fucking vote to make a difference. It takes more than an entire state voting one way to make a difference. It takes more...when you're up against lying/cheating republicans along with your own party who fucked you over in 2016 to push their own agenda.",Cool_Bastard,e92upzd,SandersForPresident

">sometimes talking like that causes people to stay home on Election Day, because why make the effort if it doesn‚Äôt work anyway?

I can't argue with that. The only change is to emphasize what I said, which was, "" **It's that it takes more than ""just voting"" to make a difference.**"" I guess I should say that voting is the very least that we can do, along with checking with our friends to make sure they are voting. I go to random blacks at work (yes I know it's weird, but it's doubly important for them) and ask if they vote. Hispanics as well (since I am half Mexican). Many. Still. Aren't/Haven't. Voted. I urge them to vote.  

>So I agree with you.

And I guess I agree with you too, that we all need to vote. 

>between now and Tuesday there‚Äôs a 0% chance of that happening so we just need to play the hand we‚Äôre dealt for now.

You are right. I just....I just hate what's fucking going on. I'm seething with it. Fuming with endless, impotent, rage at the right & Trump supporters and what the DNC has done. We're fractured...and if we don't pull together this week, and in 2020...I got nothing.

>The company also stated **it joined Portman‚Äôs campaign 21 months before the election, and that, ‚ÄúTogether, i360 and the campaign strategized a plan to execute one of the most custom-targeted, integrated campaigns to date with a focus on getting the right message to the right voter wherever that might be.**‚Äù

>...**during the 2016 election, i360 also ran $11.7 million worth of ‚Äúindependent‚Äù expenditures for the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, Freedom Partners Action Fund, and Americans for Prosperity in Portman‚Äôs race.**

>These outside spenders, two of which are Koch-funded groups, **and Portman‚Äôs campaign all used i360 to coordinate their digital marketing, phone banks and television ad buys, in the same market, in the same election.**

>Additionally, **i360 supplied Portman‚Äôs campaign with other issue-based models on gun control, gay marriage and abortion that the company continues to supply to its clients in 2018.**

The only 'assault' weapons you can buy now are worth around 40,000.00$. They are grandfathered in. You can not buy a new production assault weapon as a normal individual. 

>‚Ä¢87% support laws to prevent convicted felons and the mentally ill from owning guns...

If you are a convicted felon you can not own a gun legally. I am fairly certain being accepted into a mental health facility will disqualify you as well.

You can vote at 18, join the military, and be tried in court as an adult. Why shouldn't they be allowed to own a firearm at 18?

>‚Ä¢63% support a ban on the sale and possession of high capacity magazines...

""High capacity"" magazines are usually 'standard capacity'. A 30 round magazine isn't ""high capacity"". Anyone who trains with firearms knows a capacity limit will only make you carry more magazines are reload more often, which is going to set you back almost nothing. I feel like this is a general misconception about firearms. 

>‚Ä¢57% support an assault weapons ban...

But there is one in place, I can not buy an assault weapon unless I have 40,000$ or so to buy a pre-ban one.

I believe a protection order against you revokes your right to own a gun. 

I don't think much of this is 'common sense'. Most people who talk about this stuff have not bought a gun or own one themselves. The only true thing any of this will do is hurt legal gun owners. A lot of gun violence and 'mass shootings' are gang related and involve pistols. However I don't hear anyone talking about a pistol ban.

Yes I voted for Bernie, and I would probably do it again. His state of Vermont just passed a magazine capacity limit law, and they are already the state with the -least- amount of violent crime. I really wish people would stop demonizing gun owners and the hobby. I enjoy old military rifles but enjoy my more modern ones as well. A lot of these 'laws' would only hurt the ability to collect interesting pieces of engineering and enjoy them in a safe manner. The majority of gun owners are law abiding citizens.

The problem is success is not as quantified as beauty, so some men feel that the 'beautiful' women is owed them, if they feel successful.  A lot of these lonely men will not date the outcast women because they are below their perceived status.  
I think men commit suicide more because of lack of perceived  financial success than romance success.  Women (maybe because of hormones) seem to be able to bestow their love onto family members and animals, with more grace than men.

2. Demand youtube retool its algorithm.

10-15 years ago someone like Ben Shapiro would have never been lumped in with right wing extremists but now there seems to be a pretty solid wall where someone can be comfortably placed by their opposition. This seems like a problem to me.

I've seen plenty of people online talking about the problem with youtube's algorithm. Where clicking on something relatively innocuous can automatically, with no action needed by the user, slowly lead you to some pretty dark stuff.

Not to mention, the manner in which youtube's algorithm seems to operate and how attention is gained in today's digital arena, there seems to be a lot of clickbait titles that don't necessarily represent the content of the video. I'm personally sick and tired of seeing ""Watch this guy smash SJW's!"" or such. Not necessarily because of the content of the videos... but that the titles are a lightning rod for people looking for that kind of thing and often the content or nuance in said videos is in no way expressed in such a myopic title and you find that nuanced discussions can and will get lumped together with some more extremist content.

My dad's a collector and spent years as the sharp-shooter instructor for his Reserve unit (among others). I've made sure that my kids have had firearm instruction.

You know what all that time around firearms has taught me? That they are WEAPONS - they are not 'tools'. THEY ARE WEAPONS. Their design and purpose is to kill things. Yes, most people only 'kill' paper or clay targets, but it doesn't change the fact that a gun has no other purpose of design than to kill. Even a knife is designed for cooking or carving rather than killing. Calling them a 'tool' does not come near affording them the respect they are due. It demeans them into something they are not and convinces people that they are not needing that respect. You can wave a hammer around in the air without killing anyone. You can shove it down your pants as a 'holster' without blowing your nuts off. You can wave it in someone's face without potentially killing them. It can be tossed in the air and - while it may hurt someone if you're stupid enough to not watch where you throw it - it's unlikely to *kill* anyone. THAT is a tool. If you wave a gun around in the air, you're a homicidal moron. If you fire them in the air without thinking of where the bullet will land, you're a homicidal moron. A gun is NOT a 'tool'. It is a weapon. Which brings up:

> it is nothing more then an extension of a human who has a will to do something.

Nope. It's a weapon. That moron waving it around or firing it into the air may not 'have a will' to kill anyone, but he might very well kill someone anyway. The toddler wandering around in her parent's bedroom may not 'have a will' to commit suicide, but that won't stop her from being dead from finding her parent's gun.  And before you come back with 'a knife lying around could kill her, too' - yes, but not as easily. And she's much more likely to cut a hand first and drop the knife - minor wound instead of fatal. Even if she fell with the knife, the wound is much less likely to be as severe as a gunshot would be.

A gun is the only weapon that is just as likely to cause a fatal *accident* as it is to be used purposefully to kill. A gun is the only weapon offered for private ownership that can be used to kill dozens from a distance - removing any chance of the potential victims fighting back. A gun deserves the respect of being regulated to the point that people REALIZE the respect it deserves. ",wdjm,e90zud4,SandersForPresident

So thumb through homicide figures in Western/ized nations with and without strong gun control laws. You'll find they're 60-75% lower.

To me, this suggests that in 2/3-3/4 of cases where a person might shoot someone else or themselves, they are not prepared to do it in a more physical manner. It's both easier to shoot someone impulsively and easier to shoot someone *period*. It's a comparatively disengaged way to attack a person, and it doesn't require any physical strength, dexterity, or stamina, aside from aiming well.

And if that is indeed true in a decisive majority of cases, it speaks for itself.

Then you don't believe in laws at all, because that's exactly what laws ARE - the rules made to protect the larger population from the actions of a few.  It's why parks close at dusk. Why there are places where there is 'no loitering'. Why there's a drinking age. Why there is pretty much every single law ever. If 'everyone was doing it', then there would be no law - it would just be an accepted part of the culture. If it didn't impact others (at least emotionally like so-called 'morality' laws), then there would be no law because no one cares what you do as long as it doesn't impact them. If guns impacted only gun owners, the rest of us wouldn't care about making laws about them. But they impact EVERYONE.",wdjm,e90yw4s,SandersForPresident

There are a lot of Israeli's and Jewish people who would agree with this statement. On the flip side there are a lot of Arabs who would agree that Jew's should be treated the same in Israel. 

Shapiro has a platform, however. On the other hand there are lots of Arab pundits that believe the opposite that have platforms in the middle east.

Are all of those people, Jews/ Israelis that believe Arabs should be wiped out of Israel and Arabs who believe Jews should be wiped out of Israel... evil?

This is where it gets really tough, this constitutes a pretty large population of people engaged in an age old conflict filled with hatred towards one another. 

I wonder how useful it is to relegate them to the category of evil.

I'm not trying to defend this perspective... rather, I'm trying to approach it with understanding, because Shapiro is absolutely not alone in his perspective and on the opposite side, there are plenty that believe the same about the Jews in that region.

The greatest medical advancements of the 20th century were cheap and made widely available. Namely antibiotics and vaccines. 

Oh and then he trotted out the 'gun to the head of a doctor' line. Useful idiot ideologue there. Demagogue the position of the opposition with something scary that no one does to drive up fear and make himself sound just. Pathetic rip of Rand Paul's foolishness. No doctor is forced to provide care in universal coverage nations under anything remotely resembling penalty of death. Addled minds spin and believe such nonsense.

">But there‚Äôs something wrong with this historical interpretation: **Harry Truman strongly supported single-payer healthcare. Daniel Patrick Moynihan supported a universal basic income in the 1960s. Dating back to World War II, Democrats sought to make a government-paid education available to as many Americans as possible.** If Democrats are marching to the left, that road leads directly back to platforms and politicians who, in their day, commanded wide support and existed firmly in the mainstream of political thought.

>What‚Äôs more, to label these programs ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù‚Äîwhich is to say, far outside the center of the political spectrum‚Äîreveals a constrained worldview. **For over six decades, center-right parties in Europe‚Äîin Britain and France, Germany and Austria, and almost everywhere between‚Äîhave either participated in or acceded to the very same policies.**

.........................................

>**In the 1940s, Senators Robert Wagner and James Murray, and Congressman John Dingell, Sr., introduced legislation that would have established a national program for hospital and medical insurance.** It was stymied by a coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans, as was also the case with Harry Truman‚Äôs efforts after 1949 to achieve the same result. But it was central to the party‚Äôs core ambition for many years after.

>**Only in the 1960s did Democrats abandon the concept of universal, single-payer health care and champion a narrower program of guaranteed hospital insurance and voluntary medical insurance for the elderly‚Äîthe program that we now know as Medicare.** They didn‚Äôt abandon universal coverage because they viewed it as too radical. Rather, they believed it was no longer necessary. After World War II, major employers began extending unprecedented benefits to workers, including annual cost-of-living adjustments to wages, defined benefits pensions and private health insurance. Given this reality, they turned their focus to a narrower subset of the population that, by definition, would not benefit from employer-based health programs: senior citizens.

>**The same trajectory was generally true of the party‚Äôs commitment to ensuring that every family enjoyed an adequate income. Roosevelt‚Äôs initial pledge seemed to augur a government-supported basic family wage. In 1946 the Democratic Congress passed‚Äîand Harry Truman signed‚Äîthe Employment Act, which codified the government‚Äôs responsibility to ‚Äúfoster and promote free competitive enterprise and the general welfare; conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those able, willing, and seeking to work; and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.‚Äù In its original form, the bill would have guaranteed all Americans remunerative work and required the government to create public-sector or private-sector jobs to meet this mandate. In this way, it would have met Roosevelt‚Äôs quality of living standard for many families.** Conservatives blocked that provision.

>By the 1960s the American economy seemed so manifestly robust that an income or jobs guarantee no longer seemed necessary. **During his tenure as assistant labor secretary in Lyndon Johnson‚Äôs administration, Daniel Moynihan argued for a minimum family income program, to be enforced by means of a negative income tax, but his was a lone voice.** Most liberals believed that if the poorest Americans had access to supplementary job training and education, they would be adequately positioned to capture the benefits of shared prosperity. Interestingly, **the next major figure to take up the idea was no other than Richard Nixon, who as president attempted to overhaul the nation‚Äôs welfare system by introducing a family income program.** The idea stalled in Congress, with conservative Republicans opposing it as too generous, and liberal Democrats decrying it as too stingy.

>Still, even into the 1970s, Democrats continued to embrace the idea that government should in some way grant every American a good job and, thereby, income. **In 1977 Democrats in Congress passed the Humphrey-Hawkins Act** - an ambitious proposal reminiscent of the Employment Act.

[Our Revolution](https://ourrevolution.com/)  
[Justice Democrats](https://www.justicedemocrats.com/candidates/)  
[DSA](http://www.dsausa.org/)  

They're making solid progress. We're honored Bernie trusted us enough to be the sub he crossposted his AMA to yesterday.  

Bernie endorsed Andrew Gillum who the article mentions:  

>campaigned ‚Äúon a decidedly progressive agenda that includes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and a Medicare-for-All, single-payer-style healthcare system‚Äù    

Helping get people like him elected puts Bernie, and our political revolution, in a much better position going forward.

>I'm working on [reforming the Democratic Party](https://my.democrats.org/page/-/Unity%20Reform%20Commission%20Report%2012.21.17.pdf) because historically it has not welcomed young people into its ranks, and I want to change that. 

-Bernie, [Oct 3^rd '18](https://youtu.be/QAYVdDnZYPA?t=3399)


>I know that a lot of people like flirtations with third parties but the practical reality is the Democratic Party has to be the vehicle for change. And it's happening. People are not only running for office, but for Democratic Party offices all across this country. I was just at a DNC meeting in Chicago... 30% were 'Bernie' elected people. Change is happening but we have go to accelerate it. That requires young people and people who have turned away from the political process to reengage, to DemEnter and take the party back so we can take the country back...   

>[How you put pressure on the DNC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFzOPhtgCg&feature=youtu.be&t=1942) is to run in county committee elections. And you work and help whichever Presidential candidate you want to support because in that process there's a whole process for electing the DNC members from the various states, and you need to be involved...

>Consider registering to vote in the Democratic primary. These are the qualifying rounds.

>The spoiler effect is the effect of vote splitting between **candidates or ballot questions[n 1] who often have similar ideologies**. One spoiler candidate's presence in the election draws votes from a major candidate with similar politics thereby causing a strong opponent of both or several to win.[1][2][3][4] The minor candidate causing this effect is referred to as a spoiler.[n 2] However, short of any electoral fraud, this presents no grounds for a legal challenge

All you're really doing sobbing spoiler effect is establishing that this brand you are so loyal too is *so* weak, tone deaf, entitled or corrupt that they can lose votes to so much more than just republicans. 

If anything, Democrats are the spoiler effect of evolving past the two party system, promising a place for the GOP while moving further to the right themselves. You're arguing for 80s republican policies at the *best* of candidates, at the *worst* you're apologizing for the Henry Kissingers of our country and you're doing it by saying that Dems don't have to campaign, compete or earn our votes. In that regard *you're* the one helping the GOP and their policies as so much of the US in this digital age has been made aware of the duplicitous liars in the Clintons, the Schumers, Pelosis and even Obamas. Of course the Republicans lie to their constituents too, unfortunately for you, people on the left are largely better educated than those on the right. The left also doesn't benefit from a voter base of fundamentally religious people that the Republicans can depend on. Democrats provenly try to appeal to Republican voters over returning to their roots and trying to bring in progressives and as has been proven, voters on the right will go full ""good christian republican"" everytime. To hope to compete with the right you demand real progressives behave as ignorant, lowering the bar so much that ass hats like Trump and his entire cabinet are possible. If your lauded party actually campaigned on something instead of campaigning on what they're not we wouldn't be having this discussion. But instead you now have to ignore the millions of voters affected by NAFTA, for profit, burgeoning prison systems, for profit, unaffordable healthcare, poor wages, crumbling infrastructure at the misuse of our tax dollars used to stage coups (like Honduras) or assassinate foreign dignitaries causing open slave markets (like Libya) or thereby contribite to the rise of groups such as Daesh (like Iraq) or commit genocide (like Yemen).

"It's trying to change legal definitions in a broad suite of policies to revoke civil rights in a way that would harm the lives of many under the smokescreen of ""being grounded in science."":  

>A series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concept of gender in federal programs, including in education and health care, recognizing gender largely as an individual‚Äôs choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth... 

>Now the Department of Health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX, the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination in education programs that receive government financial assistance... 

>The department argued in its memo that key government agencies needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined ‚Äúon a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable.‚Äù The agency‚Äôs proposed definition would define sex as either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals that a person is born with...  

>The new definition would essentially eradicate federal recognition of the estimated 1.4 million Americans who have opted to recognize themselves ‚Äî surgically or otherwise ‚Äî as a gender other than the one they were born into.

>‚ÄúThis takes a position that what the medical community understands about their patients ‚Äî what people understand about themselves ‚Äî is irrelevant because the government disagrees,‚Äù said Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Education Department‚Äôs Office for Civil Rights in the Obama administration and helped write transgender guidance that is being undone.

>The move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers, large and small, to exclude the population from civil rights protections and roll back the Obama administration‚Äôs more fluid recognition of gender identity. The Trump administration has sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military and has legally challenged civil rights protections for the group embedded in the nation‚Äôs health care law.

>Several agencies have withdrawn Obama-era policies that recognized gender identity in schools, prisons and homeless shelters. The administration even tried to remove questions about gender identity from a 2020 census survey and a national survey of elderly citizens.

>For the last year, the Department of Health and Human Services has privately argued that the term ‚Äúsex‚Äù was never meant to include gender identity or even homosexuality, and that the lack of clarity allowed the Obama administration to wrongfully extend civil rights protections to people who should not have them.

So we vote for a Democrat President, after 2 years not a ton has changed, so we vote in a Republican Congress.

Then we vote in a Republican President, after 2 years nothing has changed, so we vote in a Democratic Congress. Etc. etc. 

Politics is fucking impossible because of the party line. Republicans all vote together, Democrats all vote together and there's never a large enough majority to truly change anything.

"I think Beto is pretty fantastic. As progressive as he is now, he can always become more progressive as the nation becomes moreso too.

His official final on record stance on Medicare For All is that it's the best idea he's seen for how to accomplish every citizen of our nation having healthcare. He's open to other ideas but he hasn't heard anything better.

As you stated, he is clearly better than any Republican and especially Cruz, since they believe Medicare For All would usher in communism. So why people who are supposed to be on Bernie's team here on the left will attack Beto for not being more progressive makes no sense to me. Follow Bernie's footsteps, don't endorse him if it's not enough for you, but don't go negative about the guy.

His response to a constituent about the difficult realities behind why black Americans are protesting and that he can think of nothing more American than protesting as the kneeling players have done was one of the best responses on this issue.

We're here right now commenting on a post which details Beto's criticizing of the Democratic Party. How many other candidates are you heading this from other than Bernie?

He's a damn good candidate who will help push much of the progressive agenda, from climate change to criminal justice reform to healthcare as a right and more. If you don't think he's that good, that's your right. But coming after him or Gillum for not being strongly enough in support of Medicare For All yet strikes me more like the negativity that would be coming from trolls or paid operatives. Didn't downvote you, but it is actually your stance that I find a disservice to the left by putting an impediment to our progress of getting as many progressive-as-possible candidates into office with each election.

"That's not true as far as the Senate goes.

In the next 20 years, urban migration is projected to climb to the point where 73% of the nation's population lives in 13 states.

This means conservatives can capture a heavy majority in the Senate in basically every election pandering to homogenous rural white communities. Even if 75% of the entire population votes for Democrats, the GOP could still conceivably take 60 to 70% of the Senate seats.

This all needs to change. You combine North Dakota, South Dakota, Arizona, Montana and Wyoming, you still aren't even getting close to touching the population center just in the Bay Area and LA County of California. But representation-wise, that's 10 Seante votes to 2.

This is absolutely not the case. Young people aren't lazy, they're disenfranchised. Young people feel that there is no point in voting because they see how the system works against them.

"The Yemen war is being fought for a reason - the Houthi rebels performed a military coup against the government of Yemen. Saudi Arabia and it's allies are trying to restore that government.

Here is their banner that they march under: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Houthis

That Arabic writing reads:

God is the Greatest
Death to America
Death to Israel
Curse on the Jews
Victory to Islam

Come on. ""Curse on the Jews""? Do we want these people in power? Does Bernie?",DriveIn8,e8z9jj1,SandersForPresident
"Is a coup inherently forbidden though?

If Saudi Arabia and friends cease interference, the Houthis might win, but if that leads to the end of fighting and the humanitarian disaster, that's still real progress for the Yemeni people at this point.

As for their banner, let's consider them by their actions, not their slogans. To be perfectly honest, there's not one group in the region, and this includes Israel, who's an uncompromised reflection of our morals and norms, nor should we expect there to be one.

">Congress is supposed to represent the American people. Instead, due to our corrupt campaign finance system, they represent the wealthy and powerful donors and lobbyists who can spend enormous sums of money to influence our government. We must create a government and a campaign finance system that represents ALL Americans, not just a handful of wealthy and powerful few.

TL;DR:

* Staffers who rely more heavily on conservative and business interest groups for policy information have more skewed perceptions of constituent opinion.  

* Elected officials are more responsive to interest groups and wealthier individuals than to average citizens state politicians from both parties systematically overestimate the conservatism of their constituents.  

* Senior legislative staff have very skewed perceptions of public attitudes... egocentric bias and interest group contact, especially with conservative groups and businesses, may drive some of the mismatch between staffer perceptions and actual public opinion.  

* Staffers whose personal opinions deviated from their constituents‚Äô opinions were less accurate in their estimates of district and state preferences.  

* Staffers who reported greater contact with corporate and ideologically conservative interest groups over liberal and mass-based citizen groups were less likely to get their constituents‚Äô preferences right.  

* 45% of senior legislative staffers report having changed their opinion about legislation after a group gave their Member a campaign contribution.  

* Staffers are more likely to interpret correspondence from businesses as being more representative of their constituents‚Äô preferences than correspondence from ordinary constituents.  

* 80% of senior legislative aides reported that constituent opinion was ‚Äúextremely‚Äù or ‚Äúvery‚Äù important in their recommendations to their bosses, most had only a limited ability to characterize what their constituents actually preferred.  

* The prospect of more competitive elections does not appear to spur greater congruence between senior staffers and their constituents.  

* Congress may seem so unresponsive to ordinary citizens is that interest group lobbying and campaign contributions skew staffers‚Äô perceptions of their constituents.  

* Staff may substitute interest groups‚Äô and donors‚Äô positions for constituent preferences.

"I'm predicting a blue wave, gaining 50 house seats and the senate including 10 justice democrats. My reasoning is that the democrats have an insane money advantage in competitive races, double sometimes triple what the republican has and Trump is incredibly unpopular, presidents often lose the house by a lot in midterms. Also polling shows a 8-9 point lead by the democrats but I believe it will be closer to 10-12 points because those polls are of likely voters but this year is seeing insane early and young voter turn out indicating a surge of unlikely voters who wouldn't be factored into polling. As for the Justice democrats I just checked the polling on each race and its rating according to 538, there are 7 solid JDs, 1 toss up JD and 6 underdog JDs with there race rated as likely R, the rest are massive long shots, so I'm predicting 10 win overall. Finally regarding Bernie 2020, I believe he will officially announce either soon after the midterms in time with his book release or early 2019, I imagine it will definitely be earlier than he announced last time because its a completely different race with 30 possible contenders so getting in early is important. ",TomBurcher,e908jc8,SandersForPresident
" 

House. I think we will definitely get a majority. Maybe 30-35 seats? I'm surprisingly optimistic.

Senate. No way we get a majority. Even if Rosen, Beto, and Bredsen miraculously win. I feel like Heidkamp loses, and one of Macaskill/Donnely loses.

Justice Democrats: Right now we have 7 on lock (Tlaib, AOC, Pressley, Oman, Grijalva). We can at worst get 7 wins...and probably at best maybe hit 15-16 wins.

The ones that have a chance right now are Ammar-Campa Najjar (down by 3 in the polls), Kara Eastman, Matt Morgan, Jess King (Only down by 4 right now in a +27 trump district), James Thompson, Rob Davidson (down by 6 in the last poll, in another +18 red district), Audrey Denney (who outraised her opponent in a +23 red district), and Randy Bryce. (Sarah Smith is a wild card right now). I feel like everyone else not mentioned is essentially toast. (The two governors might have a small chance though?)

PCCC/Our Revolution candidates that will definitely make it through: (I'm not sure how legit these candidates are, but they seem okay looking at their websites)  
Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia  
Veronica Escobar  
Mike Levin

The other thing people don't realize is that there are a ton of sleepers in deep red districts (like a lot of the JD candidates listed). However, there are a ton of our revolution/PCC/PR candidates that are doing a ridiculously good job. Richard Ojeda, JD Scholten (the one against the racist Steve King), Liz Watson, Leslie Cockburn are holding their own in deep red districts. Jess King and Audrey Denney are doing way better than expected. Denney for example, got the local newspaper to endorse her (the Chico news has never endorsed a democrat for like 30+ years). I am hoping that several of them outright win. Otherwise the establishment is going to vulture in for 2020 (kind of like what happened to Doug Applegate).

The other reason why I'm a bit optimistic.

The Intercept wrote an article about how there could be potentially 40+ democratic newcomers that are entering to congress, that do not accept corporate pac money. So there will definitely be a no corporate pac caucus that Alexandria Ocasio Cortez wanted.",isomorphicring,e90d6xx,SandersForPresident
">Given the president‚Äôs propensity to lie about almost everything, it is not surprising that Trump is lying about Medicare for All‚Äîa proposal which 70 percent of the American people now support.

">The Supreme Court on Friday night refused to halt a novel lawsuit filed by young Americans that attempts to force the federal government to take action on climate change, turning down a request from the Trump administration to stop it before trial.

>The suit, filed in 2015 by 21 young people who argue that the failure of government leaders to combat climate change violates their constitutional right to a clean environment, is before a federal judge in Oregon. It had been delayed while the Supreme Court considered the emergency request from the government.

>Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch would have stopped the suit. The other justices did not indicate how they voted on the government‚Äôs request.

>The court‚Äôs three-page order said the government should seek relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. It noted the government‚Äôs assertion that the ‚Äúsuit is based on an assortment of unprecedented legal theories, such as a substantive due process right to certain climate conditions, and an equal protection right to live in the same climate as enjoyed by prior generations.‚Äù

>The justices acknowledged that the 9th Circuit had previously turned down the government but said those decisions came when there was a ‚Äúlikelihood that plaintiffs‚Äô claims would narrow as the case progressed.‚Äù That no longer seems the case, the unsigned opinion said, suggesting the possibility that the 9th Circuit might see things differently now.

>And it left open the possibility that the government could return to the Supreme Court.
Close

>The goal of the lawsuit is to compel the government to scale back its support for fossil fuel extraction and production and to support policies aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been confident throughout this case that we would get to trial, and I believe we will get to trial,‚Äù Julia Olson, the attorney for the youths and executive director of Our Children‚Äôs Trust, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Friday evening. ‚ÄúWe have overcome everything the government has thrown at us. It is not luck. It is the strength of the case and the strength of the evidence and the strength of the legal arguments we are making.‚Äù

>The Obama and Trump administrations had repeatedly asked lower courts to dismiss the lawsuit, questioning its merits, saying discovery requests were ‚Äúburdensome‚Äù and arguing that the suit would usurp the authorities of Congress and federal agencies.

>The plaintiffs ‚Äúseek nothing less than a complete transformation of the American energy system ‚Äî including the abandonment of fossil fuels ‚Äî ordered by a single district court at the behest of ‚Äòtwenty-one children and youth,‚Äô ‚Äù Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court.

>‚ÄúAs the government has maintained since first moving to dismiss this suit in 2016, [the] assertion of sweeping new fundamental rights to certain climate conditions has no basis in the nation‚Äôs history and tradition ‚Äî and no place in federal court.‚Äù

>Francisco acknowledged that he was asking for ‚Äúextraordinary relief‚Äù by asking the high court to intervene before a trial began. But he said the unique nature of the lawsuit deserved such an exception.

>If the long trial were allowed to proceed, ‚Äúit could well be years into the future‚Äù before the government could ‚Äúseek relief from such an egregious abuse of the civil litigation process and violation of the separation of powers.‚Äù

>The government has made similar arguments in lower courts, but time and again, judges allowed the case to proceed. The government also went to the Supreme Court this summer seeking a stay, but the court in an unsigned opinion called the request ‚Äúpremature.‚Äù

>In a 103-page filing this week intended to keep the trial on track, the plaintiffs argued that the Trump administration would not suffer ‚Äúirreparable‚Äù harm in having to go through with the case.

>‚ÄúThis case clearly poses profoundly important constitutional questions, including questions about individual liberty and standing, the answers to which depend upon the full evaluation of evidence at trial,‚Äù the lawyers wrote, adding: ‚ÄúThese young plaintiffs, mere children and youth, are already suffering irreparable harm which worsens as each day passes with more carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere and oceans.‚Äù

>The young activists also used the chance to once again demand that the courts compel the government to ‚Äúcease their violation of plaintiffs‚Äô rights, prepare an accounting of the nation‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions, and prepare and implement an enforceable national remedial plan to cease the constitutional violations by phasing out fossil fuel emissions and drawing down atmospheric CO2.‚Äù

In my view, the younger generation is the most progressive generation in the history of our country. They are leaders in the fight against sexism, racism, homophobia, religious bigotry, and discrimination. They also understand, even though Trump does not, that climate change is very real and has to be addressed. This younger generation, will have a lower standard of living than their parents if we don‚Äôt turn the economy around and create jobs that pay decent wages. I have talked to too many college graduates who are earning 10 or 11 bucks an hour - and that is not acceptable. Further, millions of young people have left school deeply in debt and are struggling hard to pay off those debts. Low wage jobs and high debt makes for a difficult existence. My hope is, that young people in response to these issues will become increasingly involved in the political process and stand up for their rights. The young people can turn this country around if they run for office, if they vote and if they get involved. I very much hope they will.  

---  


What makes me hopeful in these very difficult times is that I get around the country a lot and meet extraordinarily wonderful people. In the last two weeks, as part of this campaign, I will have visited 12 states in support of Democrats and progressive candidates. I have met with hundreds of people who are working day and night working to improve their communities and these people give me a great sense of hope for the future.  

---  


My favorite book at the moment is a brand new book that I wrote that will be coming out in a couple weeks called ‚ÄúWhere We Go From Here‚Äù and this book talks about the work that I and other progressives have been doing over the last two years in opposition to Trump‚Äôs reactionary agenda and how we go forward in creating a government that works for all, and not just the wealthy few.

I think there is a great deal to learn from many countries around the world especially Scandinavian countries. These countries ‚Äì Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden ‚Äì provide healthcare to all people as a right, have excellent universal child care programs and make higher education available to all their young people at no or little cost. Further, they have been aggressive in taking on climate change and moving towards sustainable energy. These countries understand it's important to have a government that works for all of their people, not just the people on top, and that‚Äôs a lesson we must learn for our country.

I love Vermont because of its natural beauty. When you visit us, you will find that we are truly one of the most beautiful states in the country and that we have four special seasons. Right now, the leaves are changing which is a beautiful time to visit Vermont. Further, we have a very down to earth type of politics in which candidates at the local, state and federal level remain close to the people. I think it‚Äôs fair to say that in Vermont at one level or another I have personally met a good percentage of the people in our state. Lastly, I‚Äôm proud that in recent years Vermont has developed one of the most progressive election systems in the country making it very easy for people to vote.

That country is facing a cholera epidemic and widespread famine. We should not be allied with a dictatorship like Saudi Arabia who is leading the effort in that war. Further, in my view, that war is unconstitutional because Congress, which has the war-making authority in our form of government, has not authorized it. Let‚Äôs get out of Yemen as soon as possible and help bring humanitarian help to that struggling country.

Saudi Arabia is a brutal dictatorship which does not tolerate dissent, which treats women as third class citizens and which is run by a handful of multi-billionaires. I strongly condemn Trump‚Äôs affection for the rulers of Saudi Arabia, and if we are to avoid a never ending war in that part of the world, it is imperative that we develop an even-handed policy toward Iran and Saudi Arabia.

This is a huge issue which I am deeply immersed in. Not only do we have to make colleges and universities tuition-free but we have to provide help to the tens of millions of Americans who are struggling with outrageous levels of student debt. Right now, there are millions of Americans who have $50,000 or $100,000 of debt and struggle to pay that debt often at high interest rates. If Trump and his Republican colleagues can provide a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1% we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free and substantially lower the burden of student debt on millions of Americans.

I think we need to make a lot of improvements we have got to appreciate the young people of this country are the future of America. That means ending the absurdity that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. Children cannot learn if they‚Äôre hungry or homeless or if their families are struggling with drug addiction. Further, we have got to respect educators in this country and make sure that we attract the best and brightest to the teaching profession by paying our teachers good wages and providing them with good working conditions. Unbelievably, in America today, there are states like Oklahoma and Colorado where kids are going to school 4 days a week because of budgetary constraints. How insane is that? Further, we need to move toward universal, affordable childhood pre-K. The bottom line is: instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations we need to fund our schools and respect educators.

When I was a young man, I did smoke marijuana on several occasions. For me, the result was a lot of coughing. Having said that, I strongly believe that we should move toward the legalization of marijuana because that issue is an integral part of our failed criminal justice system. Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country, and there are millions of Americans who have police records because they were arrested for possessing marijuana. And when that happens, it can be harder to get a job or an apartment. If we are serious about criminal justice reform in this country, we must move towards the legalization of marijuana and that is something I‚Äôll fight for.

I would hope that there would be widespread support in Congress, as I know there is among the American people for the legislation that I‚Äôve introduced, which would guarantee healthcare to all Americans through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program. The first year of the 4-year phase-in program calls for lowering the eligibility age from 65 to 55 and for covering all the children in America. I would hope we can get widespread bipartisan support for that. Further, all Americans, whether they‚Äôre conservative or progressive understand we‚Äôre being ripped off by the pharmaceutical industry, which charge us by far the most per country. The American people want us to stand up to the drug industry and I hope very much we gain bipartisan support to do that.

It is incomprehensible to me that we have a president who is not only a racist, sexist, homophobe, xenophobe and religious bigot - but a president who rejects science. The debate over climate change is over. The scientific community is almost 100% united in telling us that climate change is real, caused by human activity, and is already doing devastating harm to our country and the world. We must as a nation lead the world in moving aggressively toward such sustainable energy as wind, solar and geothermal and when we do that, we will not only combat climate change but create millions of good paying jobs and lower electric bills. We must also move toward the electrification of our transportation system and rebuild our crumbling rail system. The United States should lead the world in combating climate change not have a president who rejects science and works with the fossil fuel industry.

This is the most important midterm election in the modern history of this country and it is enormously important than young people come out and vote. In fact, in my view, if young people vote at the same percentage as older people do we can transform this country and move aggressively towards, economic justice, social justice, racial justice, and environmental justice. Do not sit out this election. It it too important. Please vote and bring your friends and co-workers to the polls.

If Democrats take control the House or the Senate we must move to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. We must immediately lower prescription drug costs in this country and we must work aggressively towards Medicare for All. We also have to take on Trump in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy as we combat the great threat of climate change.",Chartis,e8xh6ad,SandersForPresident

> The union is not on their side. The average workers' ""high"" rate of pay is due to the company, not the union.

How would that even work ? Companies always want to pay less in salary to workers. Only necessity will force them to raise wages, or maybe a very generous boss. But that seems extremely rare. Unions just form a way to negotiate collectively (were this is allowed or facilitated).

"> Wow. I wanted a real answer not an attack.

It is a real answer. Because I heard those arguments a million times before. It's literally anti-union propaganda. Are all unions good ? No, they are not. But that was not what you were writing. 

And the other stuff too, it's just based on nothing. Look at the studies on the effect of the minimum wage. This is about employment levels (""ahh if we raise wages, people will lose jobs"")

https://www.epi.org/publication/the-impact-of-raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-12-by-2020-on-workers-businesses-and-the-economy-testimony-before-the-u-s-house-committee-on-education-and-the-workforce-member-forum/

> Most importantly, research has consistently shown that raising the minimum wage boosts the pay of low-wage workers who typically come from low- and moderate-income households. Because these households typically spend a larger portion of their income than wealthier households, the rising wage floor can provide a modest boost to consumer spending, generating new business activity, particularly in lower-income areas where consumer demand is more depressed. And this is true even if some firms have to enact small price increases as a result of the higher minimum wage. Pay raises for low-wage workers resulting from higher minimum wages are vastly larger than any resulting price increases ‚Äì typically by a factor of more than 10 to 1.7 This is because labor costs are only one piece of businesses‚Äô overall operating costs, and as previously noted, raising pay simultaneously generates savings from higher productivity and lower turnover.

And let me quote you

>  He feels like he has worked really hard to get to the salary level that he is currently at. He feels that if minimum wage is raised, he would then effectively be making less

Which is simply implying that your husband cares more about his relative earnings than about poor people. 

> he is a selfish bastard for wondering what a minimum wage increase will do to struggling middle class families.

If you are struggling, how do you expect poor people on 7.25 to do ? 

Inflation (this is specific to some places in Cali), but i guess it's at least somewhat similar for other places

> Businesses could absorb the remaining payroll cost increases by increasing prices by 0.6 percent through 2023. This price increase is well below the annual inflation rate of 1.8 percent over the past five years. Price increases in restaurants would be 5.1 percent.

> This is the real world, not all unions are perfect.

At least they are democratic, so if they are not doing a good job your husband or other people can influence it directly. Unlike those who own the company.

> But from what my husband sees they are taking 25 cents an hour from employees and the employees aren't getting anything from it.

Maybe he union is powerless and can't do much, maybe your husband is wrong. I don't know. But I am 99.99% sure that unions are far more often on the side of workers than the company is.

">This campaign comes down to whether we want:

>* to end one-party-rule in Washington led by a pathological liar.
>* a party to regain control who gave a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1% and tried to throw 32 million people off of the health care that they had.  
>* to continue to have a President who refuses to even acknowledge the reality of climate change let alone do anything about it.  
>* to stand up and elect people to office who'll put a check on a President who is moving us in a very, very bad direction.  

---  

>By Sunday night I'll have been to 13 states throughout this country holding close to 35 different rallies and meetings. We should be afraid in this country that:  

>* we have 30 million people living without any health insurance.  
>* we pay the highest in the world for prescription drugs.  
>* if Republicans retain control they're going to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, & Education.  

>That's a lot to be afraid of, but if we have a high voter turnout you're going to see Democrats regain control over the House, have a shot to win the Senate, and win Governors chairs all over this country. Young people as the most progressive generation in the history of this country have to come out, stand up, and fight for what they believe in.  

---  

>Remember that candidate Trump told you he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, & Medicaid. take a look at his last budget:  

>* Trillion dollar cut in Medicaid  
>* $500 billion in Medicare 
>* $72 billion in the Social Security Trust Fund  

>The time is for us to be afraid of the real problems in this country:  

>* the possible loss of protections for pre-existing conditions  
>* young people not being able to afford to go to college  

---  

>[Trump] lies every day. And he sets the tone for the Republican Party, and they lie. Don't believe them. They're right now going to the Supreme Court to have the Affordable Care Act ruled unconstitutional. Which means all of the protections which now exist for people with pre-existing conditions will be gone.  

---  

>All over the world what we've seen is a significant rebound from the 2008 crash. German, Japan, the United States. Unemployment is low, that's great. On the other hand millions of people today are working for 8 or 9 or 10 bucks an hour and they can't afford to put food on the table. And you got the Trump administration

"[Selected highlights:]

>This is the most important midterm election in the modern history of this country. Whether we continue one-party, right-wing reactionary rule in Washington, in which we have a Congress that follows a bigoted, racist, sexist, homophobic president ‚Äî who also is a pathological liar ‚Äî or whether we stand up and fight back for justice for all people. That is what is at stake.  

>If we want to change the direction of the country and move toward a system of justice ‚Äî economic, social, racial, environmental justice ‚Äî we have got to vote and we have to see young people coming out at a much higher level than they have ever voted in the past.  

---  

>I would say that the major issue that I hear is healthcare. And people understand that the Republicans have not given up on their desire to throw tens of millions of people off the healthcare they currently have.  

>They are now trying to get the Supreme Court to rule the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, and if that happens, what we‚Äôll see is that people with pre-existing conditions will no longer be able to get the insurance they need at an affordable cost.  

---  

>1. A Medicare-for-all, single-payer system. The first part of that effort ‚Äî it‚Äôs a four-year phase-in ‚Äî is to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 55 and to cover all of the young people in this country.  

>2. Raise the minimum wage to a living wage: 15 bucks an hour. And I will do everything that I can to make sure that in the first 100 days of a Democratic Congress, we pass a $15 an hour minimum wage.  

>2. Address the crisis of climate change. And that means invest heavily in energy efficiency and sustainable energy.  

---  

>What most Democrats are now talking about is a lot more progressive and meets the needs of working families than was formerly the case.  

>But there are differences of opinion within the Democratic Party. I and others represent the progressive wing. We think the future of the Democratic Party is to stand up with working families, with the middle class, and be prepared to take on the very powerful and wealthy special interests that have so much power over the political process in this country.  

>There is virtual unanimity in the understanding that we have a very, very dangerous president who is trying to divide the American people up. It is absolutely imperative that all of us ‚Äî not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents who believe in American democracy, who believe and respect individual rights, who do not want to see this nation divided up ‚Äî that we come together and elect a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate and Democratic governors on Tuesday.

---  
>I have a 100% pro-choice voting record. And I would say about 95% of Democrats in Congress are pro-choice. We will not be able to support a pro-choice agenda and take on Republicans who are trying to deny a woman the right to control her own body unless Democrats control the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.  

>If there is somebody whose views on choice might disagree with mine but will be voting to make sure that Democrats control the House and the Senate, yes, I will support that person because it‚Äôs absolutely imperative that Democrats control the Congress if we are going to preserve a woman‚Äôs right to choose.  

---  

>I think people do not fully appreciate the power that they have. First of all, for young people, it is absolutely imperative that people registered to vote and come out to vote.  

>If people under 30 voted at the same percentage as the general population, we would transform America. The younger generation today is the most progressive generation in the history of this country.  

>But it doesn‚Äôt matter what your views are if you‚Äôre not active in politics, if you are not voting, if you are not supporting candidates who stand up for what you believe in. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you believe unless you are participating in the process and making sure you are electing people whose views are similar to yours.  

>People have got to register, people have got to vote, but that‚Äôs not enough. What people should appreciate is that once somebody is elected, that‚Äôs not the end of the game. You have got to hold that person accountable.  

>If a few hundred people ‚Äî which is not all that many ‚Äî tell a member of Congress or a senator that we want you to attend a town meeting because we‚Äôre concerned about student debt, or we‚Äôre concerned about climate change, or we‚Äôre concerned about sexism and we want you to come out and talk to us at a mutually convenient time, you would be surprised at how many congressmen would say, ‚ÄòYes. Let‚Äôs work out a good time and I‚Äôll see you there.‚Äô And then you can put pressure on that member.  

>So, holding elected officials accountable is extraordinarily important.

Meanwhile, I am a regular everyday person, who volunteer for Bernie and tried to fix a corrupt and broken Caucus. This showed me how little power I really have. I had some impact on the caucus but zero impact on the general.

So who is more to blame for Trump being in office? Me a single voter or Hillary Clinton, leader of one of the most powerful political dynasties in decades? 

Stop blaming voters and realize Hillary Clinton did this to herself and had more impact on the 2016 election, than any single voter.

In September and October of 2016 I was told by multiple people on the Hillary Campaign that they didn't need me because Hillary was going to win by millions and that she could completely ignore the Bernie Sanders supporters. Both Podesta and Schumer said for every Liberal we turn away we will pick up 2 Republicans in swing states. Guess what, Hillary lost those swing states and Donald Trump won.

In my opinion, a job making minimum wage is just a temporary occupation while you attend school, gain experience, or find something more in line with your interest.
The other thing to keep in mind is that it could go the other way. Take for instance McDonald's. They will probably more likely automate the process so in essence your gonna be cutting 10 jobs into 3.

We can do great things, next we must:  

######Be The Press & Press The Press

>When people talk about how well we did with young people, clearly one of the reasons for that was our success with social media....

>Media is about what is not covered. The more important the issue is to large numbers of working people, the less interesting it is to corporate media. Issues being pushed by the top 1% get a lot of attention. My candidacy, alone, accounted for the majority of attention that network Sunday news shows paid to poverty, one of the great crises facing the nation. National television coverage ignores the reality of important parts of American life. Corporations have an agenda that serves their bottom line. In fact, that‚Äôs the reason for their existence. The largest media corporations are themselves owned by even larger conglomerates that have their own particular set of economic interests. 

>The extraordinary power of the multinational corporations provides billions of dollars a year in advertising revenue to the corporate owners of the media. These powerful corporations have an agenda. Six corporations control 90% of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy. Those six corporations are Comcast, News Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. 

>I received 46% of the pledged delegates, won 22 states, and lost some states by a few votes. In other words, we had a significant amount of support from ordinary people. On the other hand, I did not win 46% of the endorsements from the print establishment and the leading newspapers in the country. In fact, I won only one. I was very proud to have received the endorsement of The Seattle Times.  

>Demand that the media focuses on the real issues facing our nation and the world, not just political gossip. And if corporate media won‚Äôt change, and they won‚Äôt, start new media. The Internet offers revolutionary prospects.

>The future is in your hands. Let‚Äôs get to work.

######Press For Medicare For All

>* Stop irrationally demonizing taxation and begin exploring how reasonable taxes can dramatically increase the social well-being of Americans and the country's economic competitiveness. 

>* Provide universal healthcare, as every other developed and many developing countries already do. This would rescue millions from misery, save money on emergency care, increase employment, and generate a healthier and more productive workforce.

######Ensure Government Structured On Social Wellbeing   

>Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5¬∞C... In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5¬∞C, global net

>As well as triggering the transition to sustainability, a [job guarantee](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/rpr_4_18.pdf) would ensure full employment, lessen insecurity & the need to compete for environmentally destructive jobs on individual & collective levels.

######Develop A Worldwide Progressive Movement


>Our job is to fight for a future in which public policy and new technology and innovation work to benefit all of the people, not just the few...

>Our job is to fight back against the coordinated effort, strongly supported by the president and funded by oligarchs like the Koch brothers, to make it harder to for American citizens ‚Äî often people of color, poor people, and young people ‚Äî to vote. Not only do oligarchs want to buy elections, but voter suppression is a key element of their plan to maintain power...  

>Authoritarians seek power by promoting division and hatred. We will promote unity and inclusion.

>In a time of exploding wealth and technology, we have the potential to create a decent life for all people. Our job is to build on our common humanity and do everything that we can to oppose all of the forces, whether unaccountable government power or unaccountable corporate power, who try to divide us up and set us against each other. We know that those forces work together across borders. We must do the same.

* Private purchases in lawful sales made outside of federally regulated dealerships are not subject to such rules and are legal unless the gun is used in a crime with the prior knowledge of the straw purchaser.

FDR literally had to threaten to quit the presidency ***in the middle of the war*** to prevent party bosses from maneuvering George Wallace out of his VP spot. He didn't do the same 4 years later, though, and through quite a degree of chicanery we got Truman as VP.

""Though economists tell us that the 2008 Great Recession ended years ago, many Americans have been left behind by the economic recovery. In this time of so much economic uncertainty, millions of hardworking American families are living paycheck to paycheck and are increasingly relying on payday loans to keep up with their bills and make ends meet.

Payday loans are short-term loans, generally less than $500 in value that come due when the borrower collects their next paycheck. While the amounts being borrowed are relatively low, the interest rates on these loans are shockingly high. Most credit cards companies charge between 15 and 30 percent annual interest, but payday lenders typically charge more than 300 percent annual interest for their loans. Worse yet, due to the high cost of borrowing and the very short repayment period for payday loans, the consumers that rely on them often become trapped in what President Obama called ‚Äúa vicious cycle of debt.‚Äù

Despite their predatory lending tactics, the universal outcry of consumer protection groups and the condemnation of leaders such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and President Obama, my opponent Debbie Wasserman Schultz has accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from payday lenders. If this were not enough, my opponent has also joined Republicans in co-sponsoring a bill that would delay the regulation of payday lenders for years and continue to burden millions of working families with endless debt. This is why the editorial board of the Sun Sentinel has called on Wasserman Schultz to ‚Äúnot swim with loan sharks.‚Äù

Debbie Wasserman Schultz has also voted to prevent President Obama‚Äôs Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from issuing regulations against ‚Äúracial redlining‚Äù in the auto loan market. There should be no place in our society for these kinds of predatory financial practices, including those that discriminate against people on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender or other personal characteristics.

When I am elected to Congress I promise to regulate the payday lending industry. I will work hard to limit the loan shark style practices of the payday lending industry and the debt traps they work so hard to create. I also promise to propose alternatives ‚Äì like postal banking ‚Äì to give working families access to the type of small loans they may need in an emergency, but at much lower interest rates. By working together, we can put a stop to this greedy industry that exploits hard working families and find new solutions for the people of Florida""( Tim Canova, 2018).

Lots of good examples. Just look at HRC pivot to the left during the primary. Reject TPP, accept min wage increase, accept free college and expanding health care... among other things.

If voters engaged instead of just abstaining you‚Äôd see more change from within. Instead parties just wait for moderates to get tired of the other side and take power.

I disagree with this. The difference is republicans will rally around their guy whoever they are.

The difference is they vote so republicans always pander to their base. The racists, the moderate republicans the tea party guys the evangelicals. The never Hillary movement was MUCH more effective than the never trump movement.

Back to my point about liberals being as dumb as republicans. HRC rejected TPP in the primaries and as far as shooting war with the Russians, you have zero evidence for that. And considering that Reagan didn‚Äôt even do this because of the nuclear deterrent it‚Äôs pretty blatant fear monger Inc to suggest in my opinion.

">Income and wealth inequality remains the great moral, economic and political issue of our time. Over the past 36 years, the three richest families in America have seen their wealth increase by 6,000 percent, while the median household has seen its wealth go down by three percent. In other words, over the last three and a half decades there has been a massive redistribution of wealth from the middle class and working families to the richest people in America. That is what a rigged economy looks like.

I was born in Brooklyn 54 years ago. I grew up in the US. I attended school in the US. I have lived my entire life in the US. I don't even know how to speak the language used in the country from which my parents came. Their attitude toward that was ""He was born in America. He will live in America. They speak English in America.""

Hell, the country my parents come from doesn't recognize me as a citizen there. As far as they're concerned, I am an American citizen.

Are we saying that I should be a stateless person because of the xenophobia of people whose families immigrated a generation earlier than mine did?

Making the maternity ward outside of the Canadian domain caused it to be unaffiliated with any jurisdiction and technically international territory.

"Legal what?

Legal Immigrants? Have you gone through Immigration? Do you know what it takes to ""legally"" enter the US? Thousands of dollars, sponsors, background checks, police reports, 100+ pages of evidence, months of waiting. The vast majority of people trying to get into the US don't have access to those resources or the money to afford the costs. I know, my wife is a Green Card holder.

It's also a major misconception for a huge section of the US that people ""legally"" immigrated and I specifically mean White folks. So far as I know immigration law didn't exist for the first 100 years of the US' existence. Up until the late 1800's there was no ""illegal"" immigration. You showed up, then through the paces, and could become a citizen. Not until the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 did we place restrictions on immigration and its important to acknowledge that because the establishment of immigration policy was fueled by nativism and racism then just the same as now.

Not to mention that the same folks that rail against ""illegals"" and even the fence sitters fail to understand  the establishment of immigration laws was a racist means by which to keep ""others"" aka the Chinese (because they are non-whites) from being able to leverage any of the social institutions available to our citizens. Capitalists turned US workers against immigrants all the while taking advantage of the immigrants cheap labor. Immigrants became the scapegoat for poor working conditions and wages rather than acknowledging that it was in fact the Capitalist bosses that were responsible and were simply blaming immigrants because it sowed division in the work force and would prevent folks from banding together to take on their bosses.

Immigration Law in the US was established as a tool for White Supremacy so listening to people cry about ""illegal"" immigration is disingenuous and ignorant of our history, or maybe they are just truly hateful people that like to blame others for their own ability to rise to the occasion. My money is on the later of the two.

IMO those that rail against immigrants and tout immigration law as some tool for good also tend to be the same people that cant accept responsibility for the way their lives have gone. More often than not I find it to be White Men in particular that are extremely hostile toward immigrants, which is interesting seeing as how being a White Man in the US is basically playing life on easy mode. So what happens when the super entitled person doesnt get everything they think they deserve or are ""owed""...they blame immigrants, they blame poor people, they blame black and brown folks.

"> Immigration Law in the US was established as a tool for White Supremacy

Not a straw-man, but good to know you are aware of logical fallacies.

> How about you try and prove that?  

I don't need to ""prove it"" it is in our history. How can you in good conscious look at Immigration Law (which started with & continued to use race as a means of determining admittance) isn't steeped and established in racism. The definition of White was such a shitty and false notion that the SCOTUS was forced to acknowledge that a dark skinned I think Indian man is in fact White under the definition provided because his ancestry came from the Caucasus Mountains however they rejected his claim because they were using the ""common sense"" definition. See [US Vs Bhagat Singh Thind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Bhagat_Singh_Thind).


The creation of a legal definition of ""White"" came to be about the same time as immigration laws came into being. There was also a massive nativist population exerting political pressure on the US Congress to restrict immigration based on race which came to fruition cause like I said, see US vs Bhagat Singh Thind. There's several other cases, a few of them older than US vs Bhagat Singh Thind but his case is the 1st that comes to mind.

I can understand that the vast majority of US citizens don't receive a well rounded education when it comes to our history. Too much exceptionalism and glossing over of some of the most vile things our nation has ever done because well it looks bad. Sadly that means folks end up mis-educated and unaware of how much they don't know.

Here's a UC Berkeley Study examining racism in past and current immigration law published in [2016.] (https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&context=blrlj)

[Ozawa vs the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozawa_v._United_States) is another example of racism in immigration.

Anecdotes aren't dismissed outright, they are just a weaker form of evidence. That anecdote is also the summation of 30+ years living as a Straight, White, Man in the US and seeing as how I am committing on Straight, White, Men, being one myself...well maybe men in this nation ought to do some reflection because our demographic has been and still is the most dangerous and destructive in the US. Violent Crime, Rape, Race Crimes, etc by and large are committed by straight, white, men. There's a reason that so many women say ""men are trash"" because our culture has major issues with toxicity, violence, and racism.

The root cause of these issues is that Immigration Law was established as a racist means of controlling who came to the nation and that it continues to do so. The root cause is the collective shedding of our native cultures for some made up bullshit called ""White"", something so poorly thought out and unscientific that PoC challenged it and eventually the laws had to change. The fact that there have been powerful and strong anti-immigration waves aimed at specific peoples is more evidence that it is about race and power and not about protecting the nation or doing what is best.

From anti-miscegenation laws prohibiting the marrying of different races, to the creation of the White Imaginary, to the formation of groups like the Asiatic Exclusion League, all the way on up to modern anti-Latino attitudes this has always been about race and power, to suggest otherwise is dishonest.

Even *IF* the racist results of these decisions were not intended, they still remain racist. Intent seldom matters.

> How many of these illegal immigrants do you ACTUALLY think are escaping imminent death, or a war zone, or cartels?

Tens of thousands. We admit about 20,000 of them. I also know there are at least 5000 of them headed here now, displaced due to the rape of Latin American nations by the US and other capitalists.

>  There are refugee processes for them, no? It's not quite ""immigration"" in that case. 

Sure, there are however getting refugee status is not simply a matter of saying you are fleeing violence. You have to prove it. Prove who you are, who your family is, where you were born, and why you were forced to leave. So basically you better have all your paperwork ready BEFORE you need the status because you can and many are turned away. You don't just apply and you are in. You must have a referral from the UN called a USRAP. Your fear of returning must be ""well founded"". Until they are processed as a refugee they remain an asylee and as such are not eligible for any government assistance. So if you don't have someone to take you in, your'e in a bad spot. And here's the best part...if a mistake is made, if the application is declined, there is no appeal. You get sent back end of story.

Finally, even if we wanted to ignore the Chinese Exclusion act, the history of laws related to immigration and naturalization going back to the late 18th century...is about race. In order for a person to apply for citizenship they have to live in the country for 2 years, maintain their current residence for a year, and...this is the real meat of it they had to be ""free white persons"" of ""good moral character"" in order to received naturalization rights.

That is to say that the very 1st law passed in the US specifically restricted citizenship by race and it just kept going from there.",ThisPlaceIsToxic,e8t9k8b,SandersForPresident

"It's difficult to address all of your points as well as the UC Berkeley study to which I am taking greatly with a grain of salt -- given the political climate at UC Berkeley. Not only that, but the content of the study makes certain inferences and uses loaded words which display the intent of the authors. 

To suggest that those immigration laws were used as a tool for white supremacy, that's just not the case. The Naturalization Act of 1906 included those of African descent, but was apparently intended to address the inconsistencies at the state level -- states would selectively enforce naturalization laws for their own electoral benefit. 

If I'm not mistaken, the cases you brought up revolved around the naturalization of foreign born citizens, not necessarily their ability to immigrate to the US. Those of African descent were eligible for naturalization, which I assume had something to do with the creation of the term ""African American"". In the 1940 Immigration Act which replaced the 1906 one, a much more diverse group was eligible for naturalization, although certain provisions within the act meant the loss of citizenship for some English residents which leads me to believe there's not necessarily a white supremacy element to those immigration laws. The 1990 act that came after that seemed to level the playing field for naturalization of all citizens. I also don't believe there was much German immigration after the 1940 act was implemented, and the Nazi Party were pretty well white supremacists. 
I honestly cannot address your personal identification of being a ""straight white male"" as I strongly, strongly disagree with your opinions on that issue. But the group most responsible for the crimes you listed.. You're simply not correct on that one. If the US population of white people (excluding latinos) is about 79%, then cumulative crimes may belong to them. Per capita, that's extremely far from being the case. 
Immigration laws were instituted for much more than anything relating to white supremacy -- politics and war were incredibly different in the early 20th century and earlier, even in the 1940s. The AEL was founded very early in the 1900s, and after a challenge of Japanese Americans for the right to attend SF public schools - they ended up winning and earned that right. But this wasn't a government organization anyway. 

Again, I can't address all the points, but to even suggest that we admit thousands illegal immigrants due to ""the rape of Latin American nations by the US and other capitalists"" is almost wholly incorrect. For example, if MS13 is a motivation for Mexicans to immigrate to achieve citizenship or refugee status, I don't see them being a product of American raping other countries or capitalism that's not domestic. 

But the process for admittance of refugees is partly due to the fact that those applying for refugee status actually *require* it instead of other incentives to move to the US. This process definitely isn't 100% perfect, but with me being Canadian and seeing the opposite end of the illegal immigration/refugee claims, examples of refugee claimants from Africa overstaying visas in the US shows how effectively the system can be abused. Almost 90% of those claimants (I could be getting the numbers wrong by a little bit) were predicted to be rejected. 

So to conclude, and again I can't address everything, immigration law is inclusive of updated and modern laws to which factually have nothing to do with white supremacy and were repealed and updated to reflect that. ",Anticitizen-Zero,e8tcrw9,SandersForPresident

Your inability to see and comprehend the destruction and theft the US has committed repeatedly in Latino nations just further illustrates how little you know about US involvement in those nations. The fact you can't see how capitalists exploited and still exploit nations in the Americas and huge swaths of Africa (and other ""poor"" nations) just tells me that you haven't looked or don't care because it hasn't negatively affected you.

I've addressed your points. I've provided cited materials. I'm done, this is Reddit and I've already gone above and beyond what most would do. It's not my job to teach you and I certainly don't owe you a thesis or dissertation on the presence and uses of racism in the current and past iterations of US Immigration Law. The racism is right there in the history, refusing to acknowledge that is just an emotional commitment to ignorance.

Canada is a racist society as well. Sure, not quite as extreme as the US but your own government has done (and recently too I might add) some pretty horrible things to non-Whites. Y'all like people to think its a nice little nation but the PoC I know and the history I know shows Canada has major issues with racism and xenophobia as well...why you might ask? Well because the European nations that created and shaped your and my nations...were racist as fuck and built that racism into the very fabric of our nations.

Also, Fact doesn't mean *YOU* think it is correct. A fact is a verifiable statement found to be true. 

Lets do a brain exercise. Racism deals with the exclusion of peoples from civic life (and other things) based on race. And 'White' is legally considered a race (although scientifically race is not real). So if the US created an immigration and citizenship policy, one that said something like ""You have to be White to be a citizen""...that would be an exclusion from civic life based on race, therefore racist. So yes, US Immigration & citizenship laws WERE founded as racist laws. Saying otherwise is untruthful and racist because it downplays the severity of the issue, and by downplaying it it receives less attention, which perpetuates the issues rather than addressing them.

The US' Immigration and Citizenship laws have since their inception been steeped in race. IMO You need to study more history because I ain't buying the BS you are pushing. Adios.

PS. Seriously...MS13 is your example? Could you have picked anything nearer and dearer to Trump's racist depictions of Latinos as your example?

Honestly, let's pretend that in an alternate universe that refusing to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple is against the law. The bigot has to make the cake. Is he still gonna be a bigot? Probably more so, but with no consequences because he can't lawfully refuse unless he's ready to willingly go to jail or get a fine, or whatever. 

Now, it is my opinion in this case that the consequences for expressing a negative and bigoted belief due to religion are much worse than muzzling bigots because it went public and got a LOT of attention. I neither agree with religion or Jack Phillips' stance on marriage and his refusal to make the cake, but do you not believe that receiving death threats, public vilification, and a court case are pretty dire consequences? 
Now, let's say I agree that the law should compel private businesses not to discriminate. What do you propose people like Rand Paul do to address racism? 
Honestly, these decisions have little to do with trying to oppress others. These things are what allow you to call others who aren't racist, racist. You can choose to create a business, and decide not to offer your services to people like me and Rand Paul. Do you really want those freedoms to be revoked? 

Edit: Also for clarity's sake, I voted for Trudeau and his values and promises really seemed to align with Bernie. I would have rather had Bernie become the president than Donald Trump and Rand Paul, my example of Rand was used because I felt he would've been a much better candidate than Trump (in terms of policy and values) although I think in the event he somehow became the nominee Hillary or even Bernie would have destroyed him in the election.

The correlation between my comment and working for a capital project does not make any sense.  My labor is not a right, I have to be employed at a competitive wage, and if I don‚Äôt want to do it I don‚Äôt have to.  If my profession were a right then that means that government and people had a right to my labor.  And if enough labor cannot be found the role of the government is to force the labor, because it is a right.  IE it is tyranny.

Very soon public schools will have this delima.  Education is deemed a right (wrongly so) and more and more skilled educators are willingly opting out as the pay is shit and little squirt mistakes have preferential treatment over the educator.  Every year school systems have a harder time retaining teachers and hiring new ones.

"The general season for candidates to declare their candidacy is early 2019. Bernie announced on April 28th, 2015.

Personally, I like Nina Turner or Barbara Lee as progressive firebrands who could take up the mantle of a rare, hard-won progressive administration.

Tulsi Gabbard also makes sense and adds some valuable foreign policy experience. 

Often times, deals are made between candidates to step out of each other's way in the primaries, in exchange for positions in the administration. Such a deal with Elizabeth Warren could potentially occur.",WhiskeyInferno,e8rv9il,SandersForPresident
"I think Bernie should announce early so he can dominate the race from the start. As for the VP I think Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren or Nina Turner are most likely.",TomBurcher,e8s0xbh,SandersForPresident
"I think when he announces will depend on what happens in the midterms.  If the Dems do very well seems to me he should announce soon after the midterms.  If things go badly, like they fail to take back the House somehow,  I think he might take some time to regroup.  You could also argue the opposite, that a disastrous midterm result would leave progressives and liberals desperate for some hope and leadership, and a good result might mean spending some time to build with the incoming progressives in Congress and see how things are shaping up.  All in all, I'd still say sooner is better than later and his hand may be forced by others‚ÄîI'll bet on not too long after the midterms.  

For VP:  though he's in great shape for his age, Bernie may well be limited by age/health to a single term.  Even if not, he has to be thinking about it as a possibility.  I think he would need to consider someone who can run and win the presidency after him, that will advance his agenda and take a major leadership level for progressives at a global level.  I don't see him picking a VP candidate just to shore up some weaknesses politically.  I'm sure he's conscious of a pent up desire for female leadership, though, so I can hardly see him not picking a woman as VP.  For that reason, I see some other Senate allies like Jeff Merkley and Sherrod Brown as most likely out.

While Elizabeth Warren is more market-oriented in her politics, and not a Democratic Socialist, she is his closest ally and collaborator in the Senate.  She's also a little old to serve as VP plus one or more terms as President, and she's another white New Englander (though with OK roots),  but I think he would trust her to carry forward after him and is his most likely and arguably best pick.   Plus he may need her supporters to get behind him to finish first.

Also, I think Warren's going to run but underwhelm in the early states, consistently falling just below 15% viability, and I see her dropping out after Super Tuesday without a whole lot of delegates (she'll do OK in caucus states, NH, and MA).  I'm guessing it's gonna be Bernie and Biden top 2, with Harris at about 20% to round out the last three standing, and could very likely end with no candidate earning a majority of delegates.  It could come down to some horse-trading for votes on a second ballot, so we'd see how that plays out.   I can't see Bernie picking Kamala Harris (too centrist) unless he's forced to in order to garner votes in a second round situation.

&#x200B;

Some others:

Nina Turner:  Obviously close ally but maybe not enough experience at a national or international level

Rep Tulsi Gabbard:  I don't see it.  Problematic support for Hindu nationalists in India and at least appearing to defend Syria's Assad

Rep Barbara Lee:  Fantastic progressive, potentially problematic backstory with Black Panther Party, less international experience, I think

Rep Pramila Jayapal:  not US born citizen, can't become president, out

Rep Raul Grijalva:  male, old, maybe not in great health so less likely though a strong progressive

Rep Ro Khanna: young, progressive, close ally in Congress.  Maybe, but male, also just a soon-to-be-second term Rep.  

I could also see Bernie picking an indigenous running mate like:

Winona LaDuke:  Indigenous/environmental activist.  Ran for VP in 1996 and 2000 on Green Party ticket with Ralph Nader, actually earned 1 Electoral College vote for VP in 2016 election.    I could just see Bernie making a pick like this.

Paulette Jordan: Idaho state rep and gov candidate.  Would be a ""dark horse"" pick, no national experience yet, but she's charismatic, progressive (I think more than she shows in red-state Idaho), and from rural America

Or like something similar to [the Rainbow Warrior Prophecy](https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/warriors-rainbow-prophecy-001577)...

> One day... there would come a time, when the earth being ravaged and polluted, the forests being destroyed, the birds would fall from the air, the waters would be blackened, the fish being poisoned in the streams, and the trees would no longer be, mankind as we would know it would all but cease to exist   
>  
>**There will come a day when people of all races, colors, and creeds will put aside their differences. They will come together in love, joining hands in unification, to heal the Earth and all Her children.** They will move over the Earth like a great Whirling Rainbow, bringing peace, understanding and healing everywhere they go. Many creatures thought to be extinct or mythical will resurface at this time; the great trees that perished will return almost overnight. All living things will flourish, drawing sustenance from the breast of our Mother, the Earth.  

As an aside, there's an awesome Jungian book I recommend called The Vision Thing. 

Near the beginning of the book, it discussed the age-old tension between ""the one"" and ""the many"", which I think parallels a lot of what is being recognized by the Rainbow Warrior prophecy. 

The most ideal outcome is a synthesis of the positive aspects of the ""many"" (diversity) and the ""one"" (integration) - where indigenous, separate, and unique cultures can coexist in some sort of differentiated whole.

However, there are shadow sides to each of those. The darker side of the ""many"" is disintegration (like ""Balkanization"" - a breakdown of civil society on a planetary scale; fragmentation of families, breakdown of nations, rise of tribalism, fundamentalism, and factionalism at every level of social organization; and the darker side for ""the one"" is mass homogenization dominated by a global market mentality that reduces all human differences to a ""bottom line"" formula (the bleak vision of a global ""franchise"") and severe political correctness.

These recurrent tensions between diversity/disintegration and integration/homogenization are about to be inspected in the coming years, in part due to this ""new international leftist movement"" being formed, as well as the counter movement and these fascist leaders/dictators being elected.

Another thing discussed in the book is a prediction that religious chauvinism and ethnic hatred will replaced by the desire to become rich. However, IMO there doesn't need to be any replacement; religious chauvinism, ethnic hatred, and greed can all fuel each other.

"From how it was explained to me by a bartender near Souda Bay the corruption ran from the top of the government all the way down to low level government workers and the people who utilized the corruption to their advantage.

It was so bad ""that's just the way things worked"". This was quite a time back though when there were Neo Nazis trying to weasel their way into the government if that helps for a time line. I believe it was around the time their economic issues were just coming to the world stage in a big way, 2012 or 13. And it was just a barside discussion with one man.",Shift84,e8p5lrt,SandersForPresident
"Economist¬†Paul Krugman¬†wrote, ""What we‚Äôre basically looking at¬†... is a balance of payments problem, in which capital flooded south after the creation of the euro, leading to overvaluation in southern Europe"" and ""In truth, this has never been a fiscal crisis at its root; it has always been a balance of payments crisis that manifests itself in part in budget problems, which have then been pushed onto the center of the stage by ideology.""

The introduction of the euro reduced trade costs among Euro countries, increasing overall trade volume. Labor costs increased more (from a lower base) in peripheral countries such as Greece relative to core countries such as Germany, eroding Greece's competitive edge. As a result, Greece's¬†trade defecit rose significantly.

Both the Greek¬†trade and budget defecits increased from below 5% of¬†GDP¬†in 1999 to peak around 15% of GDP during the crisis.¬†A major driver of the investment inflow was Greece's membership in the EU and the Eurozone. Greece was perceived as a higher¬†credit risk alone than it was as a member of the Eurozone, which implied investors felt the EU would bring discipline to its finances and support Greece in the event of problems.

As the American Great Recession¬†spread to Europe, the amount of funds lent from the European core countries to the peripheral countries such as Greece began to decline. Simultaneously, reports in 2009 of Greek fiscal mismanagement and deception increased¬†borrowing costs; the combination meant Greece could no longer borrow to finance its¬†trade and budget defecits affordably.

A country facing a ""sudden stop"" in private investment and a high (local currency)¬†debt load typically allows its currency to¬†depreciate to encourage investment and to pay back the debt in cheaper currency. This was not possible while Greece remained on the Euro. Instead, to become more competitive, Greek wages fell nearly 20% from mid-2010 to 2014. This significantly reduced income and GDP, resulting in a severe¬†recession, decline in tax receipts and a significant rise in the¬†debt-to-gdp ratio. Unemployment reached nearly 25%, from below 10% in 2003. Significant government spending cuts helped the Greek government return to a primary¬†budget surplus by 2014.",Stubborn_Outlier,e8uip3e,SandersForPresident

* Eliminate tax breaks for big oil, gas, and coal companies.  
* Prevent American companies from avoiding U.S. taxes by corporate inversions.  
* Close loopholes that allow U.S. corporations to artificially inflate or accelerate foreign tax credits.


**Reforming the Estate Tax**

* Exempt the first $3.5 million of an individual‚Äôs estate from the estate tax.
* A 45% tax that would only impact the wealthiest 0.3% of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million. 50% for $10-$50 million of value, 55% for $50+ million, and an additional billionaire‚Äôs surtax of 10%.  

* End tax breaks for dynasty trusts.
 1. Strengthen the ‚Äúgeneration-skipping tax‚Äù by applying it with no exclusion to any trust set up to last more than 50 years.
 2. Bar donors from taking assets back from GRATs just a couple of years after establishing them 
 3. Ensure walthy families pay income taxes on earnings generated by assets in ‚Äúgrantor trusts.‚Äù
 4. Sharply limit the annual exclusion from the gift tax for gifts made to trusts.

* Close other loopholes in the estate and gift tax, including valuation discounts.
* Protect farm land and conservation easements, 
 1. Allow family farmers to lower the value of their farmland by up to $3 million for estate tax purposes.
 2. Increase the maximum exclusion for conservation easements to $2 million.


**Tax Wall Street Speculators**

* Create a tax on Wall Street to significantly reduce speculation and high frequency trading. 
 1. This plan would provide a tax credit to individuals making under $50,000 and couples making under $75,000 to ensure that they would not be impacted.
 2. Trades would be taxed at a rate of 0.5% for stocks, 0.1% for bonds, and 0.005% for derivatives.


**Lift the cap on taxable income that goes into the Social Security Trust Fund**

* Tax on all income above $250,000 to expand Social Security benefits and to ensure that Social Security remains solvent for the next 58 years. 98.5% of wage earners would not see their taxes go up.  


**Reforming the Personal Income Tax**

* End Tax Breaks for Capital Gains and Dividends for the Wealthy: Repeal the special, low income tax rates on capital gains and stock dividends for married couples with incomes greater than $250,000.  

* Higher Income Tax Rates for the Wealthiest 2.1% percent of households.  
 1.  37% on income $250,000-$500,000.
  2.  43% on income $500,000-$2 million.
  3.  48% on income $2 million-$10 million.
  4.  52% on income $10 million and above. 

* Limit tax deductions for the rich: Replace the Alternative Minimum Tax, PEP, and the limit on itemized deductions with a $0.28 dollar limit on tax savings for each dollar of deductions for households with incomes above $250,000.

######INEQUALITY

Good governance ensures an equitable society because of the [benefits that limiting harm fosters.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ)  

The government is mandated to regulate commerce and is already doing do. A government of the people, by the people, and for the people means a system that works for all of us, not just a few.    

Trump's TCJA costs [$9.5 trillion](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53884-apb2019.pdf) over 10 years.  83% of which [goes to benefit the 1%](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/18/16791174/republican-tax-bill-congress-conference-tax-policy-center). 


Divided by the [97,600,000](https://www.fool.com/taxes/2017/03/14/how-much-does-the-average-american-pay-in-taxes.aspx) taxpaying members of the 99% (minus the $1,671/y that helps fund accessible programs), that results in an average $6,373/y per person being transferred to the 1%. A tithe of **$17.46 being paid every day** of the year by workers to those making [$719,000](https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2017) or more. All the while:  

&nbsp;  

>44% of adults could not cover an emergency expense costing $400. 

>The policies pursued over the past year seem deliberately designed to remove basic protections from the poorest, punish those who are not in employment, and make even basic health care into a privilege to be earned rather than a right of citizenship. This bodes ill for for society as a whole.

>The persistence of extreme poverty is a political choice made by those in power. 

---

>* Stop irrationally demonizing taxation and begin exploring how reasonable taxes can dramatically increase the social well-being of Americans and the country's economic competitiveness. 

>* Provide universal healthcare, as every other developed and many developing countries already do. This would rescue millions from misery, save money on emergency care, increase employment, and generate a healthier and more productive workforce.

And worldwide it's even worse:  

[148,200 individuals have personal assets of over $50 million.](https://i.imgur.com/PDpDwLp.png) In total they own ~$31 trillion, 11% of global wealth is owned by a group that could fit inside a stadium.

######FEDERAL JOB PROGRAM

>The program pays a uniform wage of $15/h, for both part-time & full-time work... It also offers basic healthcare through and expansion of Medicare, as well as other basic benefits such as childcare‚Äîeffectively establishing a minimum benefits pack.  

>The PSE program is designed to ensure that all employers pay fair (living) wages, but without competing for employees or displacing private sector undertakings.  

>The design targets job creation for workers with lower skills and education‚Äîsince they have high unemployment & underemployment. PSE participation for workers with greater education and skills will be transitional until conditions improve... when labor markets are tight, employers will recruit workers out of the PSE program.  

>By design, employment in the PSE program will move in a countercyclical pattern‚Äîgrowing in downturns and shrinking in recoveries as workers are pulled into the private sector. This helps to stabilize economic activity and household incomes. Economists call this an automatic stabilizer. The government‚Äôs budget will also move in a countercyclical manner as spending on the program cycles with the economy. This too helps to smooth cyclical fluctuations.  


>We also see the advantages of decentralizing administration to the community level. Since the goal is to create jobs in every community, and to create projects that are beneficial to every community, it makes sense to involve the local communities in the projects from the proposal stage through to implementation, administration, & evaluation. We would allow state and local governments as well as registered nongovernmental, not-for-profits to put forth proposals.  


>Proposals can be solicited for apprenticeship programs that would train PSE workers for skilled employment outside the program after a term.  


>Scaling up to a national program that might employ 15 million workers will take time. The program will probably be phased in over a period of several years, both in terms of the numbers employed and the wages & benefits paid.  

>There are approximately 15 million potential workers who would be likely to join the program.   

>* 1 full-time worker could lift a family of up to 5 out of poverty
>* 1 full-time & 1 part-time worker, a family of 8 could rise out of poverty. 
>* In 2016, nearly 7.5 million people in families with a full-time worker lived in poverty. 
>* 9.5 million children would be lifted out of poverty. 
>* The average income gap of the 8 million families living in poverty in 2016 was $10,505‚Äîwhich is less than what a half-time job in the PSE would pay. 
>* Direct spending on the program is just below 2.5% of GDP per year. (Excluding increases in tax revenue due to economic growth as well as potential savings on a wide range of federal, state, and local programs that are targeted to low-income households. In 2015 for example, the federal government spent  $104  billion  on  food and nutritional service programs.)

Our spending is of course highest in the world, but it is more than the totals of #2 through #10 combined (those other 9 countries, btw, coming to more than 10x our population).

Meanwhile, our population suffers from a reprehensible level of healthcare service, higher education funding, and transportation infrastructure, for example- repeatedly explained as a result of ""not enough funding""

So, yeah, reducing nonsensical defense spending is, in fact, a very reasonable goal in and of itself.  I agree that underfunding what we need to do is a bad idea, and I agree that we need to be involved in fewer conflicts.  But I think, if you look at our spending in context, it's clear that the spending is more than just a downstream impact of the conflicts.

**Concerning the basing of the F-35 program:**

I found this published [here](https://vtdigger.org/2017/03/08/rosanne-greco-5-way-win-solution-airport-noise-problems/) on March 8^th '17:  
  
>Court documents show that Sen. Patrick Leahy phoned the Air Force chief of staff and told him to base the F-35 in Vermont. Sen. Leahy and Sen. Bernie Sanders both stated they supported the F-35 basing because the F-35 was essential for VTANG‚Äôs future. Court documents show this reason was incorrect. The senators, along with many other Vermonters, were misled to believe that VTANG needed the F-35 to continue to have a mission. Federal and legal documents, as well as sworn testimony from the U.S. Air Force, show unequivocally that VTANG will continue to have a flying mission whether or not the F-35 is based here.  

I don't think there was a vote but the Air Force announced their intent to seek basing locations [here](http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/111369/air-force-officials-release-draft-eis-for-f-35-operational-basing.aspx), and [here](http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/111369/air-force-officials-release-draft-eis-for-f-35-operational-basing.aspx) announced:  

>The current active Air Force and Air National Guard alternatives under consideration are: Burlington Air Guard Station, Vt.; Hill Air Force Base, Utah; Jacksonville Air Guard Station, Fla.; Mountain Home AFB, Idaho; and Shaw AFB/McEntire Joint National Guard Base, S.C.

a lot of Americans should start comparing the cost of health care in the states to other first world country's and pointing the finger at the health racket you guys have set up which has led to you guys paying enormous prices. You live in a society. Stop spending so much on defense and start spending more on social aspects in your country.,midved,e8myq55,SandersForPresident
"I think you‚Äôre missing a lot of tertiary benefits to providing health care to everyone, and totally ignoring any of the research that shows it would actually cost you less money to cover everyone.  

A healthier population uses less care, especially later in life.  That alone would offset costs dramatically for everyone paying into a Medicare for all system.  

Almost as important as a healthier population, cost controls over profiteering pharmaceutical companies, price gouging medical clinics and hospitals, and unnecessary testing and procedures is a huge part of the problem.  Having state and federal power to contain those costs and set sensible pricing for medical care is a must, and it is not going to happen unless we legislate it.  Medicare for all would provide that opportunity.  

In the end you do end up paying for the people who don‚Äôt have health care.  You pay for it when your insurance premiums go up as hospitals have to charge more for uninsured patients that can‚Äôt pay bills.  You pay for it when society deals with unhealthy people that make unhealthy choices like drugs, or crime because they do not have their basic needs met.  

You pay for it all, and on top of the money that goes to paying for patient care you are paying the obscene amounts of money that go to line the pockets of the executives and shareholders of insurance, pharmaceutical, and patient care corporations.  

Medicare for all would dramatically lessen the cost of administering insurance, primarily because the profit motive would no longer siphon off premiums for profit, and because we have way too many small insurance markets with duplicated efforts.  This is a huge reason we can actually save money and cover everyone at the same time. 

Medicare for all is not only the right step from a moral and human perspective, it‚Äôs also the most conservative approach to containing the cost of administering health care.  The market approach to health insurance and pricing of care is by all accounts a massive failure, as many privatized forms of delivering basic needs eventually become.

[@BernieSanders:](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1056670125909250053)

* Today, I would like to endorse some of the ballot measures in states across the country. 

 California: Proposition 10  
 Florida: Amendment 4  
 Colorado: YES on Amendment 73 and Proposition 112 and NO on Amendment 74  
 Massachusetts: Question 1  
 Washington: Initiative 1631  

  Thread üëá

* Currently California cities and towns aren't permitted to pass rent control measures to address the affordable housing crisis. That should change. Municipalities should have the freedom to deal with the decline in affordable housing and rising rents. Let's pass Prop 10.

* How is it possible that in Colorado a majority of school districts can only afford to keep their schools open 4 days a week? How are teachers paid wages so low that some have to work two jobs to survive? Our kids deserve a high-quality education. Amendment 73 is a no-brainer.

* Colorado Amendment 74, pushed by the fossil fuel industry, seems to be one of the most dangerous propositions in the country. It could open the flood gates for oil, gas and other corporate interests to bankrupt the state. This extremely dangerous amendment must be defeated.

* Given the crisis we face with climate change, in my view we should move toward a total ban on fracking. At a minimum, it seems obvious that we must protect communities from the environmental damage that fracking causes. In my view Colorado voters should support 112.

* Florida has the opportunity to re-enfranchise 1.4 million formerly incarcerated people to fully participate as citizens. Passing Amendment 4 is an important step for both voting rights and criminal justice reform.

* Question 1 in Massachusetts would set a safe maximum on the number of patients nurses can treat, so that patients can receive the quality care they deserve. Nurses are behind this initiative, and I trust them when it comes to knowing what is best for their patients.

* With the recent report from the IPCC noting the drastic action required to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, Initiative 1631 is an important step forward for the people of Washington State.

* I want to thank the many activists I met with who informed me about these important ballot measures nationwide which can help us create a fairer and just society. We must rise to the historic occasion and make sure we have record voter turnout so we can transform this nation.

"According to that logic literally any government spending is a social program. It's just about the most cynical justification imaginable for enabling large-scale attacks against civilian targets, to argue that bombing civilians is in any way justified because it puts food on bomb-makers' tables.

Because the bomb-maker could be doing literally anything else and it would still hold. Instead of paying for a bloated military-industrial complex that employs a bunch of people, we could pay for *anything* else and observe the same effect. Any government spending at this scale will provide jobs, education, housing and training in service of whatever the spending is for. So let's get all of those benefits in pursuit of superior education, healthcare, and infrastructure rather than acts of terrorism.

I'd like to offer an important point in this regard, as well: just because American exceptionalism is an ongoing atrocity (which it is) doesn't mean that America isn't, or at least that we *can't be*, a net force for good.

This is important precisely because there is no such thing as ending empire. There is only the change of the guard. If we step aside on purpose, who takes the reins? Russia and China.

So American exceptionalism needs to die, but we still need to give careful thought to American Better-Than-The-Alternativism, and focus as much on applying our might *correctly* rather than on whether it should exist.

Work place protections have mostly been pushed passed and maintained through the Democrats. 

Civil rights legislation was spearheaded by the Democrats, who knew they‚Äôd lose what was until then a major part of their coalition (southern democrats). 

I‚Äôll give you the antiwar movement, but I‚Äôd like to hear any arguments that the dems aren‚Äôt significantly less in favor of unnecessary wars. 

Nixon may have created the EPA, but supporting legislation was spearheaded by Democrats. 

In recent years, where Republican legislators aren‚Äôt acting, SCOTUS decisions have reduced those work place protections, and truncated civil rights legislation. This is why the Supreme Court is important. 

For and the environment the president and congress are doing much in that area. 

The fact of the matter is, Democrats are currently the only vehicle for effecting progressive policy at the national level. ",Gen_Ripper,e8mtujb,SandersForPresident

"Ah, but you see, putting down a space force is not about militarizing space.  Think of it more like a Coast Guard for Satellites, tracking debris, harmful radiation, solar flares, that kind of stuff.  Honestly, that should be separate from the Air Force.  

A separate agency will have a stronger voice in Congress, greater leverage for international efforts, and generally more independence to pursue its goals.  

For your last thing tho.  Countries around the world are retreating from the traditional world order in diplomacy.  That‚Äôs my other fear; its a spiral of downward armament that ends with someone shooting.  And it‚Äôs not just us.  

If we decrease our budget, we face a Europe fearful of Russia and a Pacific fearful of China.  The result is that those countries will pounce on our perceived weakness, and expand their influence to bully and coerce other countries.  

If we arm, then other countries will see us as a worse threat.  So I‚Äôm not sure what you speak of when you say diplomatic efforts.  It‚Äôs the hope of every incoming president and the failure of each outgoing one.  

So I don‚Äôt know.  I don‚Äôt have an answer for cutting the military budget.

>We are seeing movements led by demagogues who exploit people‚Äôs fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power.

>Just this past weekend, in Brazil‚Äôs presidential election, right-wing leader Jair Bolsonaro, who has been called ‚ÄúThe Donald Trump of Brazil,‚Äù made a very strong showing in the first round of voting, coming up just short of an outright victory. Bolsonaro has a long record of attacks against immigrants, against minorities, against women, against LGBT people.   

>Bolsonaro, who has said he loves Donald Trump, has praised Brazil‚Äôs former military dictatorship, and has said, among other things, that in order to deal with crime, police should simply be allowed to shoot more criminals. This is the person who may soon lead the world‚Äôs fifth most populous country, and its ninth largest economy.

>Meanwhile, Brazil‚Äôs most popular politician, the former president Lula da Silva, is imprisoned on highly questionable charges, and prevented from running again.

>Bolsonaro in Brazil is one example, there are others which I will discuss. But I think it is important that we understand that what we are seeing now in the world is the rise of a new authoritarian axis.

>While the leaders who make up this axis may differ in some respects, they share key attributes: intolerance toward ethnic and religious minorities, hostility toward democratic norms, antagonism toward a free press, constant paranoia about foreign plots, and a belief that the leaders of government should be able use their positions of power to serve their own selfish financial interests.

>Interestingly, many of these leaders are also deeply connected to a network of multi-billionaire oligarchs who see the world as their economic plaything.

>Those of us who believe in democracy, who believe that a government must be accountable to its people and not the other way around, must understand the scope of this challenge if we are to confront it effectively. We need to counter oligarchic authoritarianism with a strong global progressive movement that speaks to the needs of working people, that recognizes that many of the problems we are faced with are the product of a failed status quo. We need a movement that unites people all over the world who don‚Äôt just seek to return to a romanticized past, a past that did not work for so many, but who strive for something better.

>While this authoritarian trend certainly did not begin with Donald Trump, there‚Äôs no question that other authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the president of the world‚Äôs oldest and most powerful democracy is shattering democratic norms, is viciously attack an independent media and an independent judiciary, and is scapegoating the weakest and most vulnerable members of our society.",Chartis,e8p3joy,SandersForPresident

The left wants to do all we can to stop Climate Change. The Republicans pull us out of international climate agreements and try to destroy the EPA. Democrats think the solution to gun violence is to have fewer guns. The Republicans have decided to follow their NRA donors and claim that having more guns would somehow reduce gun violence. Democrats want to improve public schools and allow all students to attend college without going into massive debt. Republicans want to move funding from public school and move it to private religious schools while opposing all effort to make college more affordable. Progressives think the solution to our awful healthcare system is to follow the lead of every industrialized country and institute a publicly funded health insurance system. The Republicans think that removing regulations and reversing the small improvements made by the Obama administration will somehow fix things.

"Many people are pretty extreme in their views. You can be ""conservative"" on one policy and ""liberal"" on another. People essentially turn it into a red vs. blue. Don't do this. It's unhealthy and counter productive to the entire process. 

Most liberal policys are rooted in science and social benefit. Most conservative policys are rooted in tradition and currently often lean towards business benefits, under the logic that that will help socially.

Don't treat taxes like a platform. Taxes are a tool.

So much of everything is both a he said she said and two sides pissing match, you're in the perfect position to sit in the middle.

Observe. Watch what each side does. Watch what your local reps do. Apply logic through your experiences to determine whether those decisions were good or bad.

Money is made by the treasury when an issuing government authorizes a budget. [That enables production of the currency by underutilized workers, resources, & production capacity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/9papuq/stephanie_kelton_but_how_will_we_pay_for_it/e80lj35/) If there is less production and more purchasers the supply becomes limited and inflation occurs. This program is an excellent way to produce wealth and avoid inflation:  



>The program pays a uniform wage of $15/h, for both part-time & full-time work... It also offers basic healthcare through and expansion of Medicare, as well as other basic benefits such as childcare‚Äîeffectively establishing a minimum benefits pack.  


>The PSE program is designed to ensure that all employers pay fair (living) wages, but without competing for employees or displacing private sector undertakings.  


>The design targets job creation for workers with lower skills and education‚Äîsince they have high unemployment & underemployment. PSE participation for workers with greater education and skills will be transitional until conditions improve... when labor markets are tight, employers will recruit workers out of the PSE program.  


>By design, employment in the PSE program will move in a countercyclical pattern‚Äîgrowing in downturns and shrinking in recoveries as workers are pulled into the private sector. This helps to stabilize economic activity and household incomes. Economists call this an automatic stabilizer. The government‚Äôs budget will also move in a countercyclical manner as spending on the program cycles with the economy. This too helps to smooth cyclical fluctuations.  


>We also see the advantages of decentralizing administration to the community level. Since the goal is to create jobs in every community, and to create projects that are beneficial to every community, it makes sense to involve the local communities in the projects from the proposal stage through to implementation, administration, & evaluation. We would allow state and local governments as well as registered nongovernmental, not-for-profits to putforth proposals.  


>We expect that most of the jobs created will provide public services in nonprofit community organizations, public schools, and state & local governments. PSE workers could be used for very small public works projects (installing  playground equipment), simple maintenance  of  infrastructure  (planting vegetation as screening), and environmental retrofitting (adding insulation to housing in low-income neighborhoods or to community  buildings). A number of proposals for creation of workers‚Äô cooperatives could be solicited. 


>Proposals can be solicited for apprenticeship programs that would train PSE workers for skilled employment outside the program after a term.  


>Scaling up to a national program that might employ 15 million workers will take time. The program will probably be phased in over a period of several years, both in terms of the numbers employed and the wages & benefits paid.  

>There are approximately 15 million potential workers who would be likely to join the program.   

>* 1 full-time worker could lift a family of up to 5 out of poverty
>* 1 full-time & 1 part-time worker, a family of 8 could rise out of poverty. 
>* In 2016, nearly 7.5 million people in families with a full-time worker lived in poverty. 
>* 9.5 million children would be lifted out of poverty. 
>* The average income gap of the 8 million families living in poverty in 2016 was $10,505‚Äîwhich is less than what a half-time job in the PSE would pay. 
>* Direct spending on the program is just below 2.5% of GDP per year. (Excluding increases in tax revenue due to economic growth as well as potential savings on a wide range of federal, state, and local programs that are targeted to low-income households. In 2015 for example, the federal government spent  $104  billion  on  food and nutritional service programs.)  

---

TL;DR:  

* It's decentralized to ensure that it serves workers as well as the communities in which they live.  
* The program pays $15/h plus benefits, establishing a nationwide effective minimum compensation level.  
* It does not compete with private employers, beyond setting minimum labor standards.  
* Employment in the program moves countercyclically, against business cycle swings, helping to stabilize consumption, output, income, and employment.  
* In cyclical upswings, private employers recruit workers out of the program; in downturns, the program absorbs workers shed by private employers.  
* Access to paid work eliminates most poverty, making it easier to deal with the poverty that remains.

"Interesting.

Varoufakis's position during the Greek financial crisis was that the (mostly Germain-led) bailouts of Greece really weren't about bailing out Greece, they were about bailing out German banks that made bad investments in Greece (in part because Greece was, with the assistance of Goldman Sachs, able to conceal the magnitude of their debt).  In effect, it was a financial transaction that shifted money from German taxpayers to German banks.  The ""bailouts"" would have imposed extreme financial austerity on Greece (i.e. turned it into a libertarian utopia with little funding for social services, education, and so on).

Greece eventually hired Varoufakis as finance minister, and in that position he advocated that it would be better for Greece to declare bankruptcy than accept the terms of the bailout they were offered.  There was a referendum on accepting bailout terms, which was rejected by voters.  Varoufakis resigned (because Greece's creditors hated him and wanted him gone).  Shortly thereafter, the Greek government accepted bailout terms harsher than the ones rejected by voters in the referendum.

Sometimes I wonder if Greece isn't a preview of the United States...  One generation doesn't want to pay the taxes to support all the various government programs they benefit from, thereby selling the future generations into financial slavery.  Then, when the money/credit runs out, all those social programs get killed or drastically reduced.

The answers to these questions went through a correlation coefficient with who they voted for; finding a high correlation between sexism scores and voting for trump (particularly with those who had liberal scores on the ideology test). 

Okay, so there has to have been more criteria than that. Were they located in the same area? What age groups were these folks in and was there a difference between respondents in different age groups? 

For this questionnaire how are they mapping people onto a left/right spectrum? Medicare for all for example is supported by majorities of Democrats, independents and republicans. Would support for that policy or other broadly popular policies that are shunned by conservative Democrats label them as 'left' in this paper?

It isn't clear to me what meaningful conversation you are trying to provoke here. Throughout the last presidential campaign conservative Democrats tried to argue that sexism was responsible for Bernie's popularity and ignored the fact that he was far more progressive and supported more progressive policies than Clinton. 

Sexism no doubt was a factor here but the title of a study based on self reporting and hidden behind a paywall reeks of scapegoating to avoid coming to terms with the other issues with that particular candidate. ",Forestthetree,e8oapod,SandersForPresident
It wasn't a rejection. It was highlighting the ideas that can be utilized to combat sexist influence.,Chartis,e8o3wkk,SandersForPresident
">And in doing so he's reminded us that this election is certainly not about the gender of the candidate.

This seems to suggest the exact opposite of what the research demonstrated. Sexism was a strong predictor of how someone would vote, and i'd argue that people who scored high on sexism wouldn't outright call themselves sexist.",Thegg11,e8o492u,SandersForPresident
What do you suggest as remedy?,Chartis,e8o4u7b,SandersForPresident
"This is a difficult question to answer to be honest. I would suggest recognizing the role sexism has had is the first step needed to fix this problem. We can't just ignore sexism and say ""ignore gender"" because one's implicit biases will impede such a strategy. As i mention, people seldom call themselves a sexist and will assume they choose to dislike someone for other reasons; even if sexism really is controlling their behavior.

I'd argue this was evident in the Sander/Clinton primary aftermath considering Clintons views/voting history were similar to Sanders, the only difference being how she wanted to get there. Yet, the primary was much more toxic than it should have been and I would argue this was due primarily to implicit sexism. Even if Clinton wasnt a perfect choice, I would argue that it is objectively wrong to say she was bad if you liked Sanders for his views; especially compared to trump.",Thegg11,e8o5fji,SandersForPresident
After that recognition what's the path forward?,Chartis,e8o5yy7,SandersForPresident
"This is getting outside of my area of expertise, but I would say creating a behavioral plan to combat sexism. One misinterpretation of sexism is assuming that it is an entity inside of someone as opposed to a list of different types of behavior (speaking is behavior as well). If we assume that it is an entity inside of someone, we cannot make a concrete plan to address it as we can only assume it ""goes away"" as opposed to fully demonstrating it actually has.

This is why a behavioral plan is more important; one would need to define what sexism is using behavioral examples (the assessment used in the study does this to some extent). A simple example would be how often one uses the words ""bitch/cunt"" towards a woman in power. Creating a plan such as: if you do not say ""bitch/cunt"" to women, you get X. 

Now, you would have to do this for a wide variety of behavior; but this demonstrates why recognizing sexism is so important; you can't just say ""he is sexist,"" and assume people know what that means; you have to say ""he is sexist because he says that Clinton is a cunt who should go to jail."" Furthermore, you can't actually address sexist behavior without successfully identifying it.",Thegg11,e8o6hmq,SandersForPresident
"Is your suggestion of a behavior plan for individuals to develop? 

What other suggestions may it include besides giving ??? to people who do not use those terms?

",Chartis,e8o7s5y,SandersForPresident
"There really isnt a great group solution that I am aware of (mostly because trying to change individual behavior without looking at the individual contingencies involved can be difficult). A behavioral plan simply means using a procedure established by behavioral psychology; the example I gave involves a DRO procedure (getting something after not engaging in a certain behavior for a set amount of time), but there are a lot of other possibilities. I mentioned individual plans because we realistically do not have the means to produce societal wide behavioral change all at once (even if we could create an effective group wide plan), instead we could only do so with individuals willing to engage in the plan.

Although you could attempt to discourage sexist behavior of others by calling it out; this may not always be the most effective solution considering the back fire effect (also something that happened a lot during the 2016 primaries).",Thegg11,e8o87sd,SandersForPresident
"What do you recommend giving people who do not use those terms?  

What other great possibilities are there?",Chartis,e8o8ky4,SandersForPresident
"I'd argue that experts would have to play the largest role in such a change (considering most people don't realize that one can be sexist even if they dont call themselves one). Something you and others can do is simply inform people of the difference between ""claiming to be a sexist"" and ""doing sexist things."" It probably won't abolish sexism, but it might help reduce it.",Thegg11,e8o8tr8,SandersForPresident

You're asking what's wrong with the current US healthcare system? 

",MissMeWThatScreenSht,e8i1svn,SandersForPresident
"We pay twice as much for healthcare as any other developed nation and we have worse health outcomes. Consider that an MRI in the USA cost 2500-3000 USD, and in Germany or Canada, it costs 400-700 USD. Germany has a multi-payer system and Canada has a single-payer system similar to what Bernie is proposing. 

The German system happens to be structured similarly to how the US system is now. The major difference is that 70% of the German health insurance industry is non-profit, whereas in the US it is almost entirely commercialized (for profit). Germany also has laws in place to guarantee coverage for a variety of conditions that in the states is left to the discretion of the insurance company, meaning if they don't want to cover your treatment costs, they don't have to. 

America for whatever reason pays substantially less than any other nation on civil services like housing, retirement, and welfare which has long been proven to be one of the best methods of preventative care.

On the other hand, if there is legitimate party unity at stake -- if the process of primaries and debates sees other Democratic candidates quick to bow out and endorse Senator Sanders -- then a confrontational slogan could do more harm than good.

"Gotta start first off by saying I've wanted Sanders to be president since 2007.  I voted for him in the primaries.  I helped GOTV.  I'm a Sanders man.  That being said, a lot of what you said here is just plain wrong or at least very misguided.

Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders are not compatible save for a couple of issues.  That will go nowhere.  Given Rand Paul's previous statements and actions (not just with Russia but general voting), his leadership is not wanted or needed.  Rand Paul is a trumpublican.

Trump never wanted to debate anyone. Hell it's questionable that he even wanted to actually win. This was plainly obvious as we got to the general.  He only said those things about Bernie because he, like many others, had the gut feeling that Hillary was going to win the primary anyway.  He was stoking division and fear in the Democratic primary process.  Besides, even if it was someone with whom he'd truly want to debate, he'd only want it because he would think it ""easy"".  And by ""easy"", we know that means he'd attempt to bully him and bend every rule because Sanders is rather honest for a politician.  There were no warm feelings, no ""secret connection"".   Trump isn't a populist - he's a nationalist.  He said so himself in front of tons of cameras just a few days ago.  There are big differences between a true populist and a nationalist.  You know who else were nationalists?  Hitler and Mussolini.  Trump will say whatever garbage gets him applause from some of the worst of humanity, and those who don't fall in line 100% are the ""enemy"".

So ""in lieu"" of all the facts - that is since the start of his presidency where he has done everything to stoke divisions within our people and our international allies, calling his political opponents ""enemies of the people"", continued wars, accepting hundreds of billions of dollars in arms deals from countries that murder journalists simply because ""it's a good deal"" - you still think Hillary is more ""evil""?  Regardless of how you interpret what Hillary said in the campaign, there are clear actions by which we can judge them.  And by that, Trump has demonstrated an almost vitriolic hatred for anyone who doesn't get on board his bullshit 100%.  And now with the longstanding nuclear arms deal about to be thrown out the window, who is actually the evil one wanting nuclear war?  Who has kept our troops in Syria?  Who encourages violence against fellow Americans?  Why I do believe that would be our CURRENT so-called president.  Trump has shown no real compassion, no real desire to lead - only rule, no desire to unify - only divide.  He would have Canada and Mexico be our enemies while thuggish, BULLYING rulers like Putin, Xi and Duterte are his role models.  

Was Hillary great?  Probably not.  She said some dumb things.  That usually happens in a relatively normal campaign process.  I'm not saying Hillary was a saint or not a warhawk - it's one of the reasons I couldn't vote for her in the primary.  But if you think I voted for Trump over Hillary in the general you're mad.  Trump showed us his true colors early on. He is no populist.

I'm going to jump over the conspiracy nut stuff and go right to this ""new world"" business. While it's a commendable goal to want to be a shining example to the world, it's harder to do in practice when the place is being run by a flaming turd who brings out the worst we have to offer.  ""Western World"" or ""New World"", all of that is over now.  Business and trade are global, culture is global, communication is global, humanity is global.  

We can all agree denuclearization is a great goal, but it's harder to do in practice when we have demonstrably horrid leaders who would like nothing more than to acquire and/or use such weapons to exercise power.  Denuclearization is a process that requires all sides cooperating in a joint effort.

In the he-said she-said between the Netherlands and Russia, my goodwill favors the Dutch and we await the outcome of the independent investigation that may find this and other evidence constitutes further proof:  

>In April 2016, Fancy Bear accessed the Washington servers of the Democrats; Cozy Bear had done so as early as the summer of 2015. Once more, the group was caught red-handed by the Dutch... The information shared by The Netherlands about the hacks at the DNC ended up on the desk of Robert Mueller, the Special Prosecutor leading the FBI investigation into possible Russian interference in the American elections. As early as December, the New York Times reported that information from, among others, Australia, the United Kingdom and The Netherlands had propelled the FBI investigation.

The reason Bernie is vocal about Russia is clear: To move to protect American democracy by enacting sanctions, preventing interference with the independent investigation, rally public support, and to help protect democracy worldwide.  

Bernie has been supportive of social media companies ensuring appropriate regulation of their platforms in this general regard.

What was said was that your hyperbolic absolutes such as ""entirely"" ""only"" ""nothing more"" & ""all"" *are* baseless. 

Like I said, part of the reason I want to see Bernie in office is that I have warranted confidence in his decision making. As evidenced by his general patterns his judgement has proven to be trustworthy. These groups on the other hand have been acting in a manner that's reasonable for a business to take action against in the current climate.  

>Nearly all the page owners contacted by the Guardian say they use ‚Äúbackup‚Äù or fake accounts  

And speaking of the climate, Bernie's been on a national tour with an election right around the corner. No reporter I've seen has put the question to him to date.  

The substance of Bob's assertion is that we should help rally voter engagement. And I think that's a stellar idea worthy of support.

>One that‚Äôs well-funded. Not by some control-freak billionaire who can petulantly renege on his big promises after he loses interest or gets corrupted, but by generous ongoing crowdsourcing that guarantees editorial independence to an uncompromisingly left-wing team of editors with big budgets to hire kickass investigative reporters, back out-of-the-box journalists, humorists and editorialists. 

.....................................................

>One that‚Äôs entertaining. The way FoxNews and Rush Limbaugh are entertaining but MSNBC and Air America aren‚Äôt/weren‚Äôt. Because humor and entertainment are what attract new readers/listeners/watchers and keep loyalists coming back.

>I only heard about the Women‚Äôs March on the Pentagon one day before. It was by happenstance. (I live in New York, six hours from DC, but like most people I can‚Äôt just drop everything and skip town with a night‚Äôs notice.)

>That‚Äôs ridiculous.

>I‚Äôve been a leftie cartoonist and columnist for nearly three decades. Yet I have hardly ever received an email from a left-leaning organization inviting me to publicize or attend or cover a protest demonstration, or a press release explaining that one was about to occur. I‚Äôve asked other pundits; they never hear from the Left either.

>Meanwhile I‚Äôm constantly getting talking point lists, action memos, press releases and all sorts of sundry propaganda from right-wing organizations as well as the mainline Republican and Democratic party apparatuses. Which is all redundant because all that crap gets ample coverage on cable news, network news, talk radio, NPR, newspapers and news websites, not to mention social media.

>I don‚Äôt need more junk email. Point is, my leftism-free inbox is a barometer of the state of the Left: disorganized and disconnected and incapable of broadcasting its message. If a protest march falls in the woods‚Äîor on the Washington Mall‚Äîdoes it make a sound? Not if the word doesn‚Äôt get out. Not if no one reports it after the fact.

>**First, we need a big-ass left-wing media group to educate people about what‚Äôs going on.** You can‚Äôt expect people to get riled up about what the U.S. is doing in Yemen if they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on there. Mainstream corporate media doesn‚Äôt cover the U.S. role in the proxy civil war.

>Second, to redefine what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù In the current media landscape, opposing war is abnormal. That message is subliminal: when‚Äôs the last time, during a foreign policy crisis, that a mainstream pundit suggested the U.S. simply stay out of it? A smart, well-funded, entertaining-as-hell media organization would provide an alternative to the establishment narrative. You can‚Äôt dream of peace if it‚Äôs not in your brain as a possibility in the first place.

............................................................

>**In the 1960s the corporate mainstream media allowed antiwar, pro-civil rights and other antiestablishment journalists and pundits to disseminate their views on TV (Cronkite criticizing the Vietnam War), on the opinion pages of major newspapers and in bestselling books. And they covered protests.**

>**No more. The Left has been ruthlessly purged.**

>**Not one single opinion writer or staff columnist or cartoonist employed by an American newspaper is a real, bonafide leftist‚Äînot a single one even supported Bernie Sanders (whose politics are basically McGovern in 1972 and was supported by half of Democrats) during the 2016 primaries.**

Why doesn't anyone bring it up outside mass shootings? Because it's a political non-starter. The only action both sides take is pandering to their base. 

Why does everyone want to ban semi-automatic rifles, even though they account for only ~3% of firearm homicides? Because it's an easy target since you will never be able to ban handguns, which account for a whopping ~70%.

4. Referring to #4, I assume you mean rifles, which I ask once again, it's 3% of firearm homicides, why are you not calling for a total handgun ban?

To answer the question you only asked this time: This is a winning slate of common sense gun legislation that may bring the US to rates of gun deaths approximate to the rest of the world while respecting the 2^nd amendment. But I'm not personally against a handgun ban. If you think it's wise, rally the public, & press for public policy I'm willing to not use mine in the US anymore.

"In another thread someone commented about how progressives didn't win a ton of federal seats during this election year and so that had them feeling down a bit.  But it seemed like concern trolling because they pretended like all the state level victories we've had didn't much matter.  So I'll leave my comment below from that thread because I think it addresses some or many of your concerns:

We first have to remember that this is a marathon not a sprint and that change takes place from the bottom up. It may take 10 years or more to fully implement the most important progressive agenda policies.

It may not seem like it from a federal election point of view but from a policy point of view we've already seen massive progressive victories in a very short amount of time. 70% of Americans now support medicare for all, 66% support legalizing marijuana, and 60% support publicly funded college. Many cities and now Amazon have raised their minimum wage to $15/hr. Most of these positions were considered radical or extreme by the corporate mainstream media just two short years ago.

I think it is a mistake to exclude lower state races as important as those victories significantly increase the progressive bench of candidates that can go on to federal office in the near future. Also, that a democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders was competitive for POTUS in 2016 and now is consistently at the top of the polls for 2020 is a massive victory for the progressive movement.

It's also important to remember that the establishment has way more money, they have the media, they have the name recognition and they have a pre-existing network of corporate supporting hacks, so in other words it will be extremely difficult to dislodge them at the federal level and yet we are seeing some of these victories take place. I can't recall the exact statistic but incumbent politicians have a large advantage from just being the incumbent alone, so it's already an uphill battle just taking on the current seated politician in any race.

Recall that Bernie did extremely well with the younger people of our country. As time goes by we lose more of the conservative voters and gain more progressive voters.

Also, midterm elections typically don't see the turnout that presidential elections do, yet we still had some federal election victories and tons of state level victories. Many are thinking that 2018 was just the appetizer for how progressives will do in 2020.

Remember too that change in politics was by design suppose to be tedious and agonizingly slow to behold. We're more impatient than ever with the pace of tech upgrades these days but on the other hand that tech is also helping to fuel change faster than ever before.

The progressive movement has made great progress in a very short amount of time and as long as we keep pushing and don't become disengaged we will see more and more progressive victories in the future, count on it.

The way things are currently, were playing a numbers game with trying to retake congress in the midterms, and i'd rather a blue dog democrat than any republican get those seats to place an appropriate check on the administration.

Currently as a party, we're not in a position to hold purity tests as the Trump admin is in control of all 3 branches, and i would hope most progressives can recognize this. For the time being, run progressives in the primary, and vote for whatever dem comes out on top, as a conservative will most likely vote much more for the Trump policies than a dem would, even if its a neoliberal dem. We need to unify as a party to regain some control and have some checks put into place. IMO, our highest priority should be reigning in the current admin, and only then should we focus on filling every seat with progressives. We can't afford another ""X progressive or bust"" movement, cause look where that's gotten us.

>But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.

If anything?  *That's* what is killing America.  I mean, people are going to have competing interests.  But the government is failing to property regulate *between* those competing interests.

It's devolved to factionalism:  ""We're only going to do things that benefit *us;* even if it comes at the expense of *them.*  The common good be damned.""

>It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole.

>The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its EFFECTS.

>If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.

>By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression. 

Which basically seems to translate to ""don't let the majority get powerful enough to be able to oppress the minority.""  But, well, *that's really hard to do.*

It basically amounts to ""don't let the majority get fired up and organize on a national scale.""  Which is exactly what the politician's playbook *is* these days!  *Trump goes to Montana.*  Or wherever.

Class war wasn't invented in the 60s.  Or, by a 19th century German philosopher.  It's as old as the concept of property.

Seeing as revolutions where the rich get eaten by the poor (after copious bloodletting) don't tend to work out very well, but a system where the rich just get to eat the poor isn't great, either, the solution would be to *try to find a way to regulate between the factions.*

Find a middle ground that seems pretty fair to all parties involved. 

""Win-win"" as opposed to zero-sum.

Because a zero-sum representative democracy *does not function.*  It can't, really.

I dunno, people seem to forget the point of liberalism.  It's to keep a society with all different groups, with their varied interests, from killing each other.  It was never meant to be the best for any one group.

In fact, the more it favors any one group (the rich, white people, whatever...), the more it fails as system. ",ting_bu_dong,e8im427,SandersForPresident

">There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.

>It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.

>The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves.

It's not advisable to try to abolish groups.  You'd need to either convince everyone to agree to the same (your) point of view, or forcefully prevent them from being able to have a different one. 

And even if you magage to do this?

>The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts.

People will just divide themselves based on other reasons. The inner versus outer party, for instance.

Class is a faction, but it isn't the only one. Even if you get rid of it, you aren't getting rid of the reason behind it:  People are tribalistic, and thus prone to forming groups, coalitions, parties, classes, nations, empires... 

And then beating other groups over the head.

So, I mean, I get why you want to make things better for lower classes by destroying the distinction, essentially destroying the upper class.  

It stands to reason that that you support your *chosen group,* as much as it stands to reason that the rich would try to screw you.

I'm saying that the only real solution for a workable democratic, representative government is to tell both sides in the class war to go screw themselves.

The bourgeoisie have a clear motive for the oppression of the workers; it‚Äôs profitable. Worker groups don‚Äôt really have as clear a motive to oppress other workers. Generally cooperative work is more productive. 

The fourth point contradicts the first two. If we assume the first two points are true, then how will any government possibly accomplish the fourth without themselves becoming representatives of a clear group? And in a capitalist economy where wealth and ownership offer substantial power and authority, why would it not follow that political power would seek to attach itself to that economic power? Liberal capital democracy will inevitably become a democracy of the bourgeoisie, where what choices the masses are allowed to vote for are only those things which don‚Äôt threaten the economic hierarchy.

"Progressives have made in roads within the DNC and at the local party level, which will help contain some of the issues we saw in 2016, where local party leaders ran stuff through without any opposition, well there will be opposition this time around.

We need mixed economy. As of now, US is more like socialism for the big money, and capitalism for the small people. So when bank failed, we bailed them out and lots of advantageous tax cuts and benefits to the big company; on the other hand, the middle class people are really screezed, no job security, no affordable health care. (if you are sick, you get bankruptcy). no cheap education, not enough money to live on when you retire.

You can see a full chart [right here](https://taxfoundation.org/details-and-analysis-senator-bernie-sanders-s-tax-plan/) that lays out Bernie's proposed tax plan and how it affects all income levels. Under Sanders' plan, your rate would have been 17.2%.

Currently, the tax rate for individuals in your position is 15%. You can see that [here](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-brackets.aspx). So yes, your taxes would have gone up 2%. I'm not going to dismiss that‚Äîit is indeed an increase. But.

As someone who makes under 20K, you would have absolutely been eligible and benefited from covered health insurance. All the money you would have had to spend on it from your savings would have stayed in your bank account.

""Certainly the most aggressive aspect of Bernienomics is the senator‚Äôs plan to collect an additional $1.6 trillion a year in taxes ‚Äî the equivalent of 7 percent of GDP. Although all households would pay higher taxes, 40 percent of the extra taxes would come from households in the top 1 percent ‚Äî those with annual incomes above $500,000, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. Those households would see their overall federal tax bite rise from 34 percent to 55 percent.

Sanders argues that it is misleading to look at the tax increase he proposes without also considering the money households would not have to spend on health insurance premiums and co-payments as a result of his plan. A study by the liberal-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice found that 95 percent of American households ‚Äî those with incomes below $225,000 ‚Äî would have more money to spend on everything other than taxes and health care.""",Sir_Hapstance,e8gclrb,SandersForPresident

If you think high taxes for the rich is straight-up theft‚Äîand yet still supported Bernie Sanders at one point(?)‚Äî then I'm not sure there's much of anything I can say to change your mind.

>‚ÄúI hear all this, you know, ‚ÄòWell, this is class warfare,  this is whatever.' No. There is nobody in this country who  got rich on his own. Nobody.  
You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear:  you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for;  you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your  factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us  paid for. You didn‚Äôt have to worry that marauding bands would come and  seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against  this, because of the work the rest of us did.  
Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific,  or a great idea? God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the  underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward  for the next kid who comes along.‚Äù

P.S. - Do you happen to make $15 per hour or more, by the way? Forgive me if I'm wrong, but based off your annual income it suggests to me that you do not.

"I'll take your points in order:

1)  Commendable.  But just because you are so 'elightened' doesn't give you any right or responsibility to disregard the points of others based on your interpretation of your privilege.  For those of us who actually worked to get where they are, the idea of privilege as a means to gatekeep is insulting, exclusionary and emblematic of the out of touch nature of the typical sewer dwelling neo-liberal.

2) The DNC doesn't put forth good candidates anymore.  They haven't in a while.  These days we have virtue-signalers (Harris), hypocrites (Booker) and identity politicians (Warren).  The only hope the party had was Bernie... and we see how well they treated him.  An argument can be made for Merekely and Insley, but I doubt much will happen there.  Those two are far too good to be taken seriously by the establishment DNC.  

Subpoint:  voting for my interests does not in any way require me to 'check my privilege'.  Retire this pathetic trope, would you?

3) You are a thoughtless loyalist and tribalist.  Your fury that a Bernie supporter could ever vote GOP is illustrative of this.  Your derision toward someone who doesn't believe exactly as you do further defines your lackluster, benal, and craven attempts to secure your own identity as a leftist.  What's funny to me is that you fail to realize that with every purity test you apply to others, you secure a win for the right. Keep excluding people who could be an ally and you'll do exactly what the DNC did... lose support.

4) You were done talking to me quote a while ago, actually.  A talk implies that information is exchanged.  All you've been doing is grandstanding on a morality soapbox built out of self-importance and delusion.  Perhaps basking in the glory of acknowledging your privilege precludes you from understanding the limitations of your hardcore stance....

I don't think people working at McDonald's should be paid $15/hour to start. Nor those that work for small/large businesses that don't require skill or risking their health/lives. Our economy would be destroyed if the minimum wage were $15. There would be no incentive to better yourself and a majority of small businesses would not be able to pay those wages while profiting.

"Disclaimer: not American, so maybe things are different, but...

The whole things seems stupid to be honest. They're comparing apples and oranges.

I'm pretty sure my ""wait times"" were lower when I was uninsured simply because I only sought doctors if I thought I was going to die. Otherwise I avoided health care as much as I could.

Now, I go to doctors way more often. Of course, sometimes I have to wait a few weeks to get an appointment with the doctor I prefer. But that's because I can look them up ahead and pick one that's an expert in whatever I think is wrong with me. If I was calling every doctor in town asking ""please help me I thing I'm going to die"" I could probably get one to see me asap, or just go to a hospital.

In a system where everyone is insured, maybe wait times will be a bit longer, but in a private system everyone who's not rich is waiting for a miracle before going to a doctor... And that doesn't count as ""wait time"".",LiarsEverywhere,e8dkhzi,SandersForPresident

"Thinking about how fucking screwed america is with health care makes me so sad. It's so scary. I have health insurance through work. I never got the card in the mail. I don't even know how to look up my info. I had to do it once this year for a health assessment thing required to keep my (shitty) rates. I couldn't figure it out. I couldn't find it on the website. The pharmacist had to call in and get the company to confirm my insurance for me. I don't go to the doctor for anything because it costs too much and anything they tell me I might need done or prescriptions or whatever will just cost more. I suspect I have anxiety issues and/or depression but do I know? lmao no, it costs too much to know. I run now and every time i feel even a slight pain I start to panic. is this it? is this where my legs stop working and I don't know why and I can't get help? My left knee has some slight pain going up the steps after a run lately. Is something wrong? Is it serious? Do I keep going? Do I need to stop for a while? Hell if I know, I can't afford to go find out from a professional, so I'll just wing it, like a couple months ago when I had consistent pain in my right calf that I ""healed"" by trying out 3 different kinds of compression garments and a massage ball because it was cheaper than actually seeing a doctor. Took two months to totally go away. My right knee has had off-and-on weirdness since I was 15 years old, 13 years ago. Never saw a doctor about it. it's just a thing. It doesn't impact my range of movement and it's just annoying, not painful, so I don't even think about it anymore. My teeth are slightly more sensitive to cold lately and now I have to worry about the dentist. I'm not even going to try and figure out when the last time I went to the dentist was, because people get really insulting about that statistic no matter what it is if it's more than ""within the last year"", but hey- another thing that's just too expensive.

"If every other first world country can afford some form of government healthcare I don't see why the richest country in the world can't. Government healthcare is overwhelmingly popular in every country that has it, and the US healthcare system is one of the most unpopular. It's not a secret as to why. Out of every major democratic country, there's only one that allows people to go bankrupt because they were born with a genetic disorder. There's only one that forces people to get two or even three full-time jobs just to pay for their cancer treatments because they can't get good insurance. There's only one that allows corporations to overcharge several hundred dollars for life-saving drugs that only cost $10 to make. There's only one where you pay hundreds for insurance every month and never miss a payment, get cancer, and then have your insurance deny you because you had chicken pox or acne as a kid decades ago.

The complete disaster of a healthcare system we have is not only insanely immoral, but also destroys worker productivity, and costs us a lot of money. This, combined with a myriad of other things, makes medicare-for-all the obvious choice, and the only ones who are opposed are insurance CEOs, the people payed off by them, the poor souls who have bought into the propaganda, and the rich oligarchs who don't want the peasants getting life-saving checkups and surgery before their sprained ankle is dealt with.",Venteran,e8epljd,SandersForPresident
Wait times are already infinitely longer for those who can‚Äôt afford to go. To those people even ‚Äúlonger‚Äù wait times are better than no wait times. ,Zexks,e8dvlpo,SandersForPresident
"Healthcare is rationed in every country. In the US healthcare is rationed according to how much you can pay. The cost of our lower wait times in this chart is that 20,000 people die every year because they cannot afford healthcare. Even more go bankrupt because of the costs. 

In practical every other advanced country, healthcare is rationed by need. If you have a heart attack? You go to the front of the line. If you have a stroke? Front of the line. If your doctor suspects you have cancer? You're not waiting to see a specialist. The cost of this is that non life-threatening treatments get pushed back. If you need a hip replacement, you may have to wait a bit. It will be inconvenient - it will probably suck, but you will ultimately get the treatment you need. Additionally in many of these countries you can elect to purchase supplemental insurance, where you can buy lower wait times if you can afford it.

I also thing that the chart this whole discussion is around it very misleading. The chart shows a percentage of seniors who had to wait more than 4 weeks for a specialist appointment. 

What it does not show:

-It doesn't show what percentage of those people who had those wait times and life threatening vs non nonthreatening conditions. 

-It specifically mentions that it does not include respondents who never tried to get an appointment. So this chart doesn't include people who avoided seeking medical care due to cost. 

-A range of wait times. It could be that Canada's wait times are commonly more than 4 weeks, but rarely more than that and that America's wait times are consistently at 3 and a half weeks, and rarely less than that. Maybe it's the opposite and seniors in Canada are waiting years for hip replacements. I don't know. The graph doesn't show that information. 

-Also, why 4 weeks? Why that specific marker? Why not 3? 2? Why not 6? or 8? I would suspect that's because they think that is that data that make their data look the best. it would be easy to show the standard deviations for specialist wait times between different countries. I want to see that graph.

It is also funny that this applies to seniors *who are under a single payer system* in the United States.",JuxtaTerrestrial,e8e0vi8,SandersForPresident
"If there is only one payer you would be expanding both the patient pool and the provider pool. Not sure if anyone has done analysis on wait times, but I think the ultimate goal of one payer is to also promote more providers to perform primary care instead of specializing, as increased access to primary care will decrease the need for specialist care as chronic problems are diagnosed sooner and followed much more closely. Obviously, this would take some time for the changes to work through, but is truly the only sustainable model for large-scale healthcare.

"This is exactly the problem.   Seniors and others on medicare/medicaid do OK right now, but only because most doctors severely limit the number of medicare/medicaid patients they will see.  They do this because they lose money on them.   Most take on a few, either out of altruism or perhaps they are required to do so, I don't know.  But basically, they are being subsidized by everyone paying the full rate.  

If everyone was on Medicare, then there would be a massive reduction in doctor income.  This will cause a lot of doctors to get out of the business.

In fact, this is basically how single payer works - you drive prices down until you start having provider scarcity problems.  That's how you know you've squeezed the optimum amount of blood out of the turnip, so to speak.

Personally, I don't have a problem with wait times.

>Bernie is the strongest candidate, for this reason: [He has an incredible appeal among young people](https://i.redd.it/zqtkx2garvt11.jpg) who may or may not vote... Another thing is Bernie Sanders' incredible strength with independent voters...  

>What candidate can put together the coalition that is[ most likely to beat Trump](https://www.commondreams.org/sites/default/files/users/user20551/180821_2020_matchup_sidebar.png), and kick out a bunch of other Republicans as well? That's the calculus that he's going over in his mind.

Doing a little pre-tour around the country](https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/10/18/our-revolution-president-nina-turner-join-sen-bernie-sanders-rally-progressive), where he was well received. So it became clear that he was thinking about running for President.
