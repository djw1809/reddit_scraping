Husted is young, high energy, has a young family and is good looking. No homo but that does not hurt a politician at all to be young and good looking. He’s a spitting image of the actor Aaron Eckhart (Thank You For Smoking) except actually better looking. He was the starting QB for either the University of Ohio or U Dayton can’t remember which. Guy is literally Chad but also a nice guy. Has a good background story (very anti-abortion pro adoption because he was adopted as a baby).

"I voted before work this morning, and even though there was no line or wait, they had a steady stream of people coming in - a shade busier than the same place and time 2 years ago, which is a bit of a surprise given it's rainy and windy out. I work across the street from a ghetto neighborhood school that's a polling place that always has buses and vans coming and going non stop all day bringing in almost exclusively minority voters every election, and so far today, it's been absolutely dead - no buses, no vans, no activists on the corner with dem party signs, and nothing but older white women and some older white men trickling in and out of the place. I am in NJ, and my gut told me that regardless of what the polls said, left leaning people just would not feel obligated to make time and spend effort to come out on a crappy rainy day to support corrupt pos Menendez, and they'd just stay home mostly. That seems to be what's happening, at least from this one polling place I have observed every election for many many years now.",edxzxz,e960yr2,The_Donald

"Three words: The American Dream.

My parents immigrated here. LEGALLY. They came to pursue the American dream. I've been very lucky so far in my life and career. I believe in equal opportunity for all. I believe that the Republican party is the best for liberty and for fiscal responsibility. Today, I voted to preserve a country that has a LADDER. Sure, you have to work to climb the ladder, but at least it's there. 

I don't want a socialist state --- that would literally destroy ANY hope for anyone to accomplish the American Dream.

My family works in medicine. I've seen first hand how Obummercare has further destroyed our deteriorating healthcare system. I also see some people turning safety nets into hammocks. I'm also aware enough to realize that democrats only try to appeal to certain voters to get their votes, but don't actually give a damn about their actual lives.

"You know what I am doing today? I'm not voting for Republicans. **I am** **punishing Democrats.**

In 2016, Democrats lost because they disillusioned their believers by cheating their candidate of the primary vote.

In 2018, Democrats will lose because they tarred-and-feathered an innocent man moderates can identify with. Who am I talking about? Trump? Kavanaugh? Someone else? Note that it's hard to pin down.

Deeply entrenched in American culture is a belief in the rules. As much as I hate the man, I agree with Dick Cheney when he said ""America is the best place in the world to do business.""

"I had to listen to an entire class (some of them from europe, and even worked for the EU), including the professor, defend Soros last week, in a political science class at a top college in a graduate school. I just sat there in awe, as they spoke, baffled, about why the right has demonized him, and made him the ""boogeyman."" I listened to ridiculous explanations, and finally decided to speak up when a student said ""I think it's just antisemitism fueling the hate towards Soros."" So I chimed in: ""Israel is antisemitic?'' I said, as I held up my laptop displaying a news article about Netanyahu, and Israel's, disdain for the man. They got riled up, and started talking about ""fake news,"" and propaganda. I then went on to explain how he's hardly jewish: he's described himself as an atheist, and described his time as a nazi collaborator as ""the best time of his life,"" ---a time in which he feels no guilt for his actions. I was then told I didn't understand the holocaust. At which point I reminded them: I have a history degree with a specialization in holocaust studies -- actual, genuine, good Jewish people who ""collaborated,"" to save their families life were tried and convicted for lesser collaborative efforts during the Nuremberg Trials. That wasn't received well, and I was reminded how the sentiment I'm sharing is antisemitic in and of itself. At which point, I had to then inform them: My family and I are Jewish, many of them Holocaust survivors who moved to America after the war - I'm fairly certain I'm not antisemitic, I think your criticism of me, being jewish and all, is antisemitic - based on your logic of what drives criticism for Soros - and you're defending and worshipping a man who's funded some of the most dangerous NGOs, has influenced politics to an unhealthy level (something the left tends to hate - billionaires influencing politics with their money -- but now it's ok, even when it's influencing pro-palestinian and antizionist ideology that begets actual antisemitism), and is one of the biggest enemies in the world not just to the Jewish people, but to the entire global population.

"Unpopular opinion- I'm not justifying anything George Soros does by any means, but IMO he downplays his experience escaping the Nazis. 

He was a terrified Hungarian Jewish teen who yes, collaborated with Nazis to seize Jewish property but he had absolutely no choice or he'd have been killed. From my point of view, that old 60 minutes footage is him deflecting and also slyly manipulating and faking out his enemies. Saying he wasn't bothered by the experience of seizing property seems very unrealistic and I don't buy it. 

Many folks who have been through horrifying experiences set up walls in their mind to block it out. No one here can comprehend what it's like escaping literal Nazis.  He admitted in that same interview that the experience defined the rest of his life. He perceives President Trump and most white Christians/Catholics as his enemy. In the United States the largest ethnic minority is German. Think about that. I am ethnic German (Athiest not Christian) and I understand why Soros likely perceives me as a threat even in 2018 long after WW2. 

Soros is my enemy because he is trying to destroy  democracy and Western Civilization. I hold zero animosity toward him as a Hungrian Jewish man because that's who he was born as. And I'm not virtue signalizing or concern trolling I've simply read a lot about him and this is the conclusion I've come to. And yes I'm aware he made a career as a speculator of manipulating economies, crashing them, then cashing in on their assets.

From a July 2018 New York Times article-

""One morning in Paris, I had coffee with Alex Soros, who is 32 and the second-youngest of George’s five children. Bespectacled, wiry and careful with his words, he had recently earned a doctorate in history from the University of California, Berkeley, and was now running his own philanthropy while also working with the O.S.F. 

He was a little groggy, having been up late the night before writing an op-ed for The Daily News rebutting Roseanne Barr’s Nazi tweet. (His father’s lawyers also filed a cease-and-desist order against Barr; she issued an apology two weeks later.) When the caffeine finally kicked in, Alex told me that for many years, his father had not been eager to advertise his Judaism because “this was something he was almost killed for.” 

But he had always “identified firstly as a Jew,” and his philanthropy was ultimately an expression of his Jewish identity, in that he felt a solidarity with other minority groups and also because he recognized that a Jew could only truly be safe in a world in which all minorities were protected. Explaining his father’s motives, he said, “The reason you fight for an open society is because that’s the only society that you can live in, as a Jew — unless you become a nationalist and only fight for your own rights in your own state.”""",GLOMPFFH_IS_FINISHED,e95kx74,The_Donald

"I don't disagree that he was a nazi collaborator to save his own skin. But, as a historian who specializes in Holocaust studies, his experience and recollection is very different from those Jewish collaborators who were ""let off the hook,"" so to speak, as it was determined they had no choice and did it to save themselves. There's an abundance of oral history on the matter, and most genuine Jews, when recollecting, sound very different than Soros, who has described himself as an atheist (and definitely did not identify, first, as a Jew, as you say - unless it was politicly expedient for him to do so. This was a cover-up effort of something already publicly known, and his Jewish identity was never all that important to him. In fact, the Soros family, \[aka the ""schwartz,"" family before changing their name\] much like the Sulzbergers, was extremely uncomfortable with their roots and Jewish heritage. He's even described his household, growing up, as a ""jewish antisemitic home.""), and showed no remorse for his actions. Most Jews express incredible amounts of guilt over their collaborative efforts - but not Soros. Many Jews killed themselves because they couldn't live with themselves. Many non-jewish collaborators even had a hard time coming to terms with their actions. Soros, to me, is a very unique case, and I don't think the self-defense theory holds up, given what he has expressed himself. Many Jewish collaborators were tried and convicted for lesser collaborative efforts than Soros, and most of them expressed guilt over it.

I'd also be hesitant to give any credence to the NYT on this matter. Not because of ""fake news,"" etc etc, but because of the NYT known bias, and how they covered these events, even at the time of the Holocaust. Sulzberger refused to acknowledge ""jewishness,"" as an identity, or anything more than a religion, and as a result, downplayed the extent of antisemitism and the holocaust. I did my dissertation on the Times, and the media's coverage of the holocaust in America. Based largely on Laurel Leff's buried by the times, it's easy to see that the NYT was reporting very differently than media in Europe, as well as Jewish publications in America, who knew exactly what was going on. But the times refused to link these events to the Jewish population, and effectively helped push a narrative that there was no persecution, or very little persecution, of Jews in Europe at the time. It's important to understand who Sulzberger was, how he thought of his own ""Jewishness,"" and the approach he took towards covering events at this time, when analyzing any coverage they have on such events.

"Well, anyone who essentially helped the Nazi cause is essentially a Nazi collaborator. There's a fine, often indistinguishable, line between collaborators and morality, and determining if their motives were justified. Many truly had no other option, while others were more nefarious. Determining this is controversial, but at least in my opinion, Soros leans towards the nefarious end, drawing this conclusion largely from his own words speaking out it. At the time, a collaborator could even be someone, as seen in Lengyel's account ""five chimneys,"" as someone who simply gained special privileges for something as basic as working with a Nazi doctor in a concentration camp. She described a situation where she was able to obtain... advil (i think.. some basic medication) as a direct result of her relationship with the camps doctor, and the bitter resentment that her fellow jews held toward her. So even basic things like this would often get you placed in the ""collaborator,"" camp by other Jews. Soros went well beyond that, working with his ""god father,"" to inventory the possessions of Jews and confiscate their property. This link is why he is classified as a collaborator. This is where the ""fine line,"" must be determined in arguing whether or not it was something he felled forced into doing in order to save his own life. It's feasible, but when he talks about being atheist, anti-semitic, how his home was antisemitic and ashamed of their jewish origins, hardly identifying as a jew, changing their name from schwartz, and then showing absolutely no guilt or remorse over his participation, it becomes harder and harder to justify the morality and even necessity of his actions ",MelvisProctacardt,e95rbw1,The_Donald

*Born in Hungary in 1930, he lived through the Nazi occupation of 1944–5, which resulted in the murder of over 500,000 Hungarian Jews. His own Jewish family survived by securing false identity papers, concealing their backgrounds, and helping others do the same. Soros later recalled that “instead of submitting to our fate, we resisted an evil force that was much stronger than we were—yet we prevailed. Not only did we survive, but we managed to help others.”*

I believe the ""diabolical confusion"" was an effort to destroy Mysticism, of actually seeking and knowing God for your self.

 From early on, the Popish hierarchy, stepped between the people and God, they wanted control no less then the Democrats do today.  Who wants it worse, we daren't find out.  They held up their little wafer and said ""you have to come to me to get God"".  

And so we forgot.

A long time ago I read that if we ever came face to face with God, first, we would fall in the ground before the majesty, then we would become aware that we are known completely and loved completely.

&#x200B;

So I wondered who was the first.  Who was first, as s/he walked across a savanna, up a mountain or sheltered in the desert, met up with God.

"Welcome!   


And please take a minute to examine the facts.  


For years the left has told us that more government spending would help more people. That any tax cuts would only favor 'the rich' and leave the middle class in the dust.  


The right argued that lower taxes and regulations and making better trade deals would help everybody. They were called evil and mean for it.  


Over the last two years the right has PROVEN that our economic theory WORKS. Unemployment is down - for EVERYONE. More people - regardless of race, religion, and sexual orientation - are able to start small businesses. WAGES ARE FINALLY GOING UP! We have fewer people on food stamps because we have fewer people who qualify.  


Our economic ideas actually make LESS POOR PEOPLE.  


People don't need a hand UP. They need the government to stop ripping them off and get out of their way. Then they can thrive.  


Please consider this when you vote in the future. When our nation's economy does well, we ALL do better. We don't need to fight over a tiny little pot for the government's table scraps.   


Socialism does NOT work. Even in a capitalist society, socialism on a small scale screws everything up. Less socialism = happier, richer people over all.

Appreciate the honesty, sir soy.

Will you kindly condemn the drone strikes our previous president ordered for years? 

Perhaps the millions of Americans who fell into poverty during the same administration? 

I heard that Obama's administration did not project the economy ever turning around, but now it seems that, retroactively and against all facts, Obama did fix the economy. 

The facts just don't corroborate your testimony, Dr. Ford, and that is why you are wrong.

Hey there, I *think* I understand where you're coming from, and I *think* you have good intentions. 

**Spez: So we can say: ""I told you so""???? Come on, that is the old way of thinking! That's what POLITICIANS love, because they can pit us against each other, 50% vs. 50%, choosing the lesser of two evils. That's what we've had for so freaking long! 2016 was the first time in MY LIFE that I didn't have to compromise. I'm not going back to the old SYSTEM!**

But let me just say, I believe you are judging this based on the past. Politics and the economy (especially the FED) have been corrupted for a long time.

The United States of America IS the best country in the world, in many, many ways. The economy is the best, biggest and most robust in the world.

Honestly, we don't exactly know how our economy would perform if the FED stopped screwing with interest rates... we can only go off of the past, before the FED, when America's economy was hot! 

We might always have ups and downs, but that's not a reason to want a FED to smooth things out. They always say that's what they're for, but the FED can't stop recessions or depressions. 2007-2008? What did the FED say? They wanted MORE power over the economy, because they failed to stop the great recession.. they said they didn't have enough authority to stop it!

B.S.!!!

It's been about 2 years of a GREAT economy... are we supposed to just say: ""Well, it's been nice, but I think we need the FED to put the fire out.""

Even in cases where a ""protestor"" disrupts a GEOTUS rally, note how the crowd maintains its composure (apart from some ""USA USA USA"" and/or ""LOCK HER UP"" while the ""protestor"" is escorted out.) The speech picks up where it left off, and the event carries on as planned. 



[**Member the times when Worst 0bama couldn't maintain control of his own crowd?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udjukpCRs5M) I member that. I also member all the times the minions of the Leftist Agenda encouraged their followers to disrespect authority, tradition, and decorum. 




After indoctrinating their people to show hostility to Police and government officials, it is no surprise that Leftist/Democrat/illegal alien mobs are showing leaders of The Left the same disrespect they have been taught to inflict on anyone who offends them. They have been conditioned to resist authority, so when Leftist leaders attempt to display authority, their followers predictably *reeeee*sist in the way they have been taught.

I did, as a long time atheist myself, and I realized that I was wrong in both the purpose and meaning of religion and that it is really the duty and moral responsibility of those who do not believe, to not destroy what is really the OS of society and culture for which atheism is not in any way, manner, or shape an even remotely suitable replacement for. 

It takes far more courage to put your faith in other people to collectively carry forward a common identity and cause over all the other options that are available to the blank slate and meaninglessness of the cold and callous reality of the empty universe that is atheism. 

I have found that even if the west's religion, Christianity and other pagan values and customs and traditions that created what we have was destroyed in good equal measure of catholicism not adapting and becoming rotten corrupt once again, and the protestants losing their direction and selling out our societies to self-interests to fill the endless void of guilt that was imposed and they were infected with by communist propaganda that our ""leaders"" foolishly allowed our societies to be overrun with defenselessly; reality simply is that you would be a savage just like the rest of the world without Christianity and the west and white culture and values, so maybe reconsider the point in throwing it out upon behest of those who aim to sabotage and frack and divide and conquer you and me and all of us. 

Because let's look at this objectively, it's not that religion is going away, what atheism and liberalism and communism only achieved was the destruction of the western world and to make liberals insane to the point that they destroy christianity while throwing open the gates to islam.

They aren't playing a subtle game. Project Veritas is really, really tough for them to deny as well. They are all excellent videos, but this one is pertinent to your question. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuJGHuIkzY",thefuzzyfox,e95aa32,The_Donald
"Short answer: some of this stuff is verified (see below), and other things are so beyond the pale (Judge Kavanaugh's hearing) that the dots connect themselves. 

With that said, skepticism is healthy, and you are right to ask this question. 


The revelations over the last two years (FBI Agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, FISA warrants and the wiretaps at Trump Tower, etc) verified several of the conspiracy theories-- they are no longer just ""theories."" Other things, like cheesy-flat-bread-gate are not verified, but don't pass the ""smell test"" either (mostly sourced directly from John Podesta's emails-- so we have proof he and others said/did weird stuff, but we don't know 100% all the details of what they were talking about). 

As for George Soros, here's a Politico article, which talks about how George Soros and other wealthy donors met with the Democrat leadership for a 3-day conference in Washington DC, to organize resistance against the Trump Administration immediately after the 2016 election:

https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/democrats-soros-trump-23131

Notice the part where Soros and friends are deliberately funding think tanks in order to push Democrat positions and policies further to the left. Now, we know for certain there's big money pushing the Democrat party to do some extreme stuff. We've all seen the pre-made protest signs against every candidate for every Presidential nomination, and this cliches all of the previous circumstantial evidence.

So to answer your question.... There is enough verification of ""deep state"" (unelected bureaucrats run amok) shenanigans, and big Democrat money involved in the most prominent cases, that similar stunts follow logically for everything else where the democrats behave similarly.

Welcome to the Twilight Zone.

"I think people need to understand that the Democrats have a three part system, Like points on a triangle.

At the bottom right is the ""Gibs me dats"" who support anything the party does in the belief, though consistently wrong, that the Democrats will provide them with more unearned wealth. They consider financial success as luck or the result of an unfair system, their hope is the Democrats will punish the successful outside of the party.

The bottom left is the irrational reactionary self absorbed ""Snowflakes"", the support anything the Democrats do with the misplaced faith the party will give them the ""special"" rights, protections, and privileges they think the so rightly deserve. Both corners of the bottom completely disregard anything but their personal crusades and defend the party at all cost to keep their agenda moving. 

The Final corner, the TOP of their triangle is the morally superior, self important, aristocrats who believe they have right to tell the peasants what to do, how to think, and what freedoms they deserve.  This group, though completely selfish in their motives, understands that to gain political power you need the peasants to support you. They makes promises to the bottom two points and even on a few occasions throw them some scraps but always with the hook of granting more control to the elites. Their televised performance is to keep the two supporting sides feeling obligated. This is why most things done for the subservient classes of Democrats are only temporary and require they be kept in power or it will be lost. But behind the scenes are where the ruling class Democrats actually make the deals and rules to help themselves and the elites.

"Make sure to vote NO on proposals 2 and 3. 

**Proposal 2 Gerrymandering**

RECOMMENDATION: Vote NO

Traditionally when one party is in power the other complains and vows to work harder next election. These days the party that loses protests and seeks to change the ground rules for the rest of time. We should be very wary of votes that change Michigan's Constitution like this Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 do. This Proposal calls for an  ""Independent"" Commission. There is no such thing as an ""Independent"" commission. Power on this is centralized under the Secretary of State who selects commission members. The only state with a Districting 'commission' like called for in this gerrymandering proposal is California. Not good!

**Proposal 3 Same Day Voter Registration**

RECOMMENDATION: Vote NO

This opens the door wide for significant voter fraud because absolutely anyone can come to or be brought to the polls. This proposal is illogical and changes the Michigan Constitution so if problems arise it will be extremely hard to fix them. Like Proposal 2, this would not be on the ballot without petitions paid for by out of state interests. ",Detroit_Telkepnaya,e95vc5t,The_Donald

"9:30 - ""I think success will do that"" \[bring unity\].

I agree with his sentiment. At least this is what happened to me. 

&#x200B;

I'm a vet and I've been a conservative/libertarian for most of my adult life. But I was never really a fan of Trump because he has a big mouth. (I mean, objectively he does) I mean, don't get me wrong, I could not imagine the Criminal Clinton Cartel being in office. That would have been pretty much game over. But I always felt like he was putting on a show and saying things just to get people engaged. It always rang false to me.

All that said, he has won me over through what he has **done** in spite of the opposition he faces. It took me the better part of his first year in office before I started to get past the way he talks and see what he was actually **doing**. I found myself saying things like, ""I don't really like him, but I like a few of the things he's done."" I wasn't happy about the Omnibus he signed, but most of what he did I liked. I also realized that he was using his oft-maligned ""rhetoric"" to troll the establishment media and get them all in a lather, which to be honest, I really love that. They're terrible and they are the enemy of the state, especially in how they suppress 'real journalists' in the new media.

But what finally did it for me was when I was talking to small business owner friends of mine talking about the labor market and I realized Trump had made changes that he promised to make. And all this while battling uphill against the partisan globalist corporate media and their hollyweird henchmen, the corrupt Republican rats in congress like McStain, a corrupt FBI, the Dems who have decided to pander to their fringe and the marxist left who have gone full retard and decided that the time for the next communist revolution is now. 

TL;DR I'm really more of a centrist, but people like me have been driven to the RIGHT by the insanity of the LEFT. They have to be stopped. To his credit, Trump is following through on his promises and I've come around on him. He is my GEOTUS.",BlackAdderLXX,e95ikrs,The_Donald

"A strong correlation has been found between weather and Republican turnout:

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00565.x

*The relationship between bad weather and lower levels of voter turnout is widely espoused by media, political practitioners, and, perhaps, even political scientists. Yet, there is virtually no solid empirical evidence linking weather to voter participation. This paper provides an extensive test of the claim. We examine the effect of weather on voter turnout in 14 U.S. presidential elections. Using GIS interpolations, we employ meteorological data drawn from over 22,000 U.S. weather stations to provide election day estimates of rain and snow for each U.S. county. We find that, when compared to normal conditions, rain significantly reduces voter participation by a rate of just less than 1% per inch, while an inch of snowfall decreases turnout by almost .5%. Poor weather is also shown to benefit the Republican party's vote share. Indeed, the weather may have contributed to two Electoral College outcomes, the 1960 and 2000 presidential elections.*

You have to pay $10 for the full article, but here's the money quote:

"Summary in no particular order:

1. Voter ID
2. Strips our Dem governor of his ability to appoint a 9 member election board, and puts gives it to the general assembly to 8 total, with no more than 4 per political party.
3. Cap income tax at 7%
4. Strips our Dem gov of his ability to appoint judges during vacancies (gives it to the GA)
5. ""Victims Rights"". Basically provisions of rights to victims of crimes
6. ""Right to Hunt and Fish"". Basically puts those rights in our constitution

I chose yes on all. I don't hunt or fish (and honestly they probably put that one on the ballot to increase R turnout). Definitely vote for Voter ID.

The changes to the way election board and vacant judge appointments clearly strips the Governor, which would swing back when we get another R in the Gov mansion, but then again, it keeps the power in the hands of the general assembly and makes it a bit more fair (max 4 per party).",BernillaryClanders,e96212b,The_Donald

There's even grocery stores where nothing is labeled in english. If you look up the stats, nothing about Illinois aligns with the national average.  Huge debt, minorities are majorities, illegals galore. That state has been effectively annexed by Mexico.

"I saw my first billboard that was all in Spanish in Chicago about 20 years ago. It was so weird to see for me at the time. Now about half the signs and billboards on the major road near where I live in my hometown are exclusively Spanish. It can happen quickly. I don't understand how people's memories are so short or are just so unaware of whats around them that they don't see the transformation happening before their eyes.

Sidenote: I have a child around 1 and all of the interactive learning toys that talk speak more Spanish that English. It infuriates me. Even one with a language setting says ""Hola!"" when set to English.

"Nevermind the fact that white people don’t all vote the same way, they’re admitting the only way the left supports voter ID is to keep people they disagree with from voting. 

...the next step is to get them to admit the only reason they don’t support it to begin with is to allow otherwise non-eligible people to vote to nullify the votes of people they disagree with. It’s the exact same concept, just a different method. One single illegal vote (whether by fraud or by non-citizens voting) nullifies the legal vote of an American who has a right to cast their vote. 

“BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE.”

The whole “muh poor and minorities” excuse is ridiculous. If you think poor or non-white people are too stupid to know how to find their voting location or obtain an ID, maybe you’re the elitist racist piece of shit you pretend to be fighting against.

In all seriousness, imagine how pathetic your life must be if these are legitimate thoughts you have, let alone things you decide to express publicly.

">Joint Statement on Election Day Preparations


>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)—in coordination with federal, state, local, and private sector partners nationwide—are continuing efforts to protect our elections. Today, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, DNI Dan Coats, and FBI Director Christopher Wray released the following joint statement:

>Our agencies have been working in unprecedented ways to combat influence efforts and to support state and local officials in securing our elections, including efforts to harden election infrastructure against interference. Our goal is clear: ensure every vote is counted and counted correctly. At this time we have no indication of compromise of our nation’s election infrastructure that would prevent voting, change vote counts, or disrupt the ability to tally votes.

>But Americans should be aware that foreign actors—and Russia in particular—continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions through actions intended to sow discord. They can do this by spreading false information about political processes and candidates, lying about their own interference activities, disseminating propaganda on social media, and through other tactics. The American public can mitigate these efforts by remaining informed, reporting suspicious activity, and being vigilant consumers of information, as discussed below.

>The United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from Russia, China, Iran, or other nations. As noted in a joint statement on October 19, 2018, such actions are a threat to our democracy, and identifying and preventing this interference is one of our highest priorities. On September 12, President Trump signed an executive order that makes clear the U.S. government will not hesitate to defend our electoral processes or punish those who attempt to undermine them.

>Our agencies have been making preparations for nearly two years in advance of these elections and are closely engaged with officials on the ground to help them ensure the voting process is secure. Americans can rest assured that we will continue to stay focused on this mission long after polls have closed.

>To learn more about efforts to protect America’s elections please visit: https://www.dhs.gov/topic/election-security.

>Voters can take a few simple steps to help secure our elections, including:

>* Get election information straight from the source—your state or local election office. Call them or check their website. They will have accurate information you can trust on the status of your voter registration, polling hours and location, identification requirements, and election results.
>* Be smart when consuming or sharing election-related information: Know your source—and think before you link. Compare reporting from multiple sources to determine reliable information. Before sharing, ask yourself, “Who wrote it? Who posted it? What are their sources?”",Manafort,e95xyf1,The_Donald

"“Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.” The Book of Romans, 13:1

If she’s calling for revolution, she should state her grievances and revolt! Good luck. 1 out of 10 times, 25 times, 100 times... it might work! Takes a lot of We the People in order to form a more perfect Union...

If she does accept God’s authority, then she should shut up, use the ballot box, petition, and vote. Rinse, dry, repeat.

If she does not accept God’s authority, then she’s in violation of the Judeo-Christian mandate to do so, and therefore practices a religion/ideology incompatible w/ Western law and practice, laws based upon English Common Law, laws based on Biblical presuppositions.

"Dont let these idiots fool you. Jihad was the annual raid on the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzyantine). It was literally about attacking Romans, taking sheep, women and other goods. The jihad was introduced because it was a way for the caliphates at the time to avoid paying their soldiers. 

Normally they would be commissioned and paid gold for their services, and this was the case early on when the prophet Muhammed (also known as the King in the Desert, by Christians) and his general Muawi led their armies to defeat the Persian empire (The once eternal enemy of the Romans) and pushed back the Romans all the way back to Constantinople. 

When the Caliphate grew to large, it split into many different sections. And each of these independant kingdoms could not afford to do annual raids as they once could have. Hence the Jihad, they sell a holy purpose to the poor. And from the poor came those who will give their life to Allah.

The annual Jihad had the biggest, and lowest SCUM of the world at that time. These were beggards who had nothing in life.

No central authority to clarify dogma and/or interpret religious texts for the modern era. Teaches to lie, cheat, and steal to further the oppression of others and their own selfish hedonistic desires. Now I learn they made up shit to avoid paying their own soldiers.    
    
For once I'd like to hear of something redeeming about Islam, but there's literally fucking nothing. Even the so-called ""Golden Age"" was a lie. People really think there was a time in history these people weren't animals, and actually contributed to society? Nope, not buying it, and when people really dig into the history of the Golden Age they'll see it was mostly non-Muslims who actually made all the discoveries. They just so happened to be living under caliphate rule at the time, so guess who ultimately took credit for the discoveries?    
    
There is absolutely ZERO reason to let Islam have even the slightest influence in western culture. Freedom of religion doesn't mean they automatically get a say in our law. It just means we can't exclude them from consideration. As far as I know, our government looked at Islam and went, ""Nope, these other religions are way better foundations to base our laws on.""

"I understand where you’re coming from. Believe me, I do.

I was there. What you’re saying sounds perfectly reasonable. I get it. 

The problem is that what you’re saying is not just wrong, it’s unreasonable. You think that the right to bear arms is about rising against the government? It’s about something far deeper than that: freedom. 

Guns are a symbol. They make all men and women truly equal in society, because criminals can’t gang up on them, and bullies can’t beat them. They are a dangerous weapon and can only cause destruction to an irresponsible, morally bankrupt society. 

You would never give a gun to a child. A nation that has guns is forced to be responsible or to destroy itself with violence from within. Trusting your neighbours with guns, and your government trusting you with them, can only happen in a free society. 

Do they help or hurt? I don’t know. I’m not a gun advocate. But I recognize the symbol and it’s power. 

As for universal healthcare, that’s tied closely to strong and legitimate views on economics that have been totally forgotten by socialists and even most liberals. 

Republicans are not worried about health care being universal, because they believe in building a country where anyone who needs health care can access it cheaply. It was cheap, but regulations and socialist policies inflate the price. And who knows, maybe time does. We don’t know what the best form of health care is because people refuse to have an honest conversation about it. 

The problem with your post is that you’re in disbelief because you think everyone is an idiot who doesn’t see what you see. 

Many of us used to see what you see. Then we were confronted with new ideas that we hadn’t thought of before, and realized it’s not black and white. 

There’s a reason America has the best health care in the world. There’s a reason most pharmaceuticals are American. There’s a reason the upper middle class with serious health problems ditch free hospitals in their country to pay for American ones. 

And if you really wanted better education, you wouldn’t want public education, but that’s a whole argument that we won’t get anywhere with. Thomas Sowell and Milton Friedman list that battle, despite having compelling alternatives.

"Okay... If let's say the entire American Military and Government was lost in a coup... That means all those fancy drones + ~2 million american soldiers. This is versus ~250 million adult americans, and enough guns for everyone to have one. If we were to take off say anyone over 65 (even though many of them would be willing to fight as well) that would be around 200 million. It would probably be less because of people who either don't have guns, or don't want to fight/can't fight for various reasons. If you were to even bring that number down to sayyy 150 or 100 million that's still 2 million soldiers versus 100 million americans... This also assumes that every soldier would be willing to fight against their own nation they are probably very patriotic for. It's not impossible the army would win, they are more organized and have the whole airforce and navy, but it would be an incredibly tough and bloody battle not in their favor.

"The Lord warned us that He would split families over His doctrine, because some would accept it and some wouldn't.

&#x200B;

God wants us to be free to choose good, the adversary wants to compel us to perform evil.  We had need of a savior only because we are free.  I believe that a free government that maximizes the power and responsibility of the individual is the most God-like government we can attain, and when discussion turns to what we should or shouldn't be allowed to do with **other people's** money, it's only a step away from the doctrines of the Gospel itself.  It is sad, but it is no surprise when friends and family members pull away from you because of your resolve to study and live correct principles.  I've lost friends and family both to the deceitful lies of prosperity in socialism and the greed of subsisting on someone else's labor to make up for their own bad decisions.

"None taken. Having slept a very peaceful night after going to bed with that warm blanket of ""fuzzy love"" wrapped around me (best way I could describe it), reflecting on it this morning I can at least now empathize or understand what people mean when they say things like ""I felt the presence of God"".  I imagine those who go to church and actively practice religion have moments like that more often, which certainly explain the allure because it really did feel profound and peaceful.  It was a moment I don't think ANYONE would object to experiencing again, and therein lies the deeper question.

I'll certainly say this -- whereas before I kinda snubbed my nose at religious people as somehow ""emotionally weak"" or requiring some kind of crutch just to get through life, I have a much deeper respect for anyone of faith.  That sense of belonging, of community, of potential love and compassion from complete strangers can manifest itself in powerful ways, particularly in a pretty cold and cruel world which at most times is just trying to chew you up and spit out your bones.  I also better recognize the power and value in faith of keeping communities together; if it were a room full of blue-haired virtue signalers rather than those of deep faith, I don't see how anything as profound could have come out of that moment.

As for opening up to the possibility ""God is real"", in the dogmatic sense that the earth is 6,000 years old and Moses parted the sea and all those parts, I wouldn't hold out any hope for that.  But one thing Jordan Peterson said when asked ""Do you believe in God?"" now strikes me as a lot more reflective now; he responds with ""I act as if God exists, which to me is what believing in God means"".  That's a piece of wisdom I don't think I'll ever lose and after yesterday's rally I'm certainly taking that to heart even more.

Sorry to be so ambiguous but I have a feeling it will take some time to process everything.  I do feel sorry for the leftists filled with so much hate, however, because if that 'warm fuzzy blanket of love' felt so peaceful and wonderful for the time I had it wrapped around me, I can't imagine how horrible and empty it must feel to instead be rolling around in a tarp made of brambles, poison oak, and thorns.  I also think it explains their virtue signaling to some degree, as they're trying to fabricate some synthetic equivalent of what spontaneously came about in Missouri last night.",free_dom0,e95ulg1,The_Donald

In this piece, he doesn't capture the likeness of either O’Rourke  or Cruz, which I feel is intentional. Cruz is clearly the villian in Carry's eyes, and so he is depicted more as a classic ""fat cat"" mobster from a Warner Bros. cartoon rather than Cruz himself. O'Rourke lacks a lot of similarity to the subject (especially the nose), but is depicted more as the saintly hero in a style reminiscent of Renaissance art.

Anyone running a private little outfit would be out of their mind not to hire me(not bragging, it’s fucking landscaping lol), but unfortunately they don’t even bat an eye my way because why hire me and pay me $15/hr when you can hire Mario at $8/hour to do the same job? It sucks for me but I don’t blame the people hiring them, I’d do the same thing if I owned a business. Actually, these smaller companies probably can’t afford NOT to hire these people, since every outfit does it you probably couldn’t keep up if you didn’t follow suit.",text_memer,e95tl5w,The_Donald

"No, that is there intent. The Radical Leftists. I will give some information I found on YouTube from a commentor. This is their response not mine, but I do agree because it matches almost exactly of what has been happening:

""Here's an interview with Yuri Bezmenov (ex KGB agent) 


ED GRIFFIN: Well, you spoke before about ""ideological subversion"" and that's a phrase that I'm afraid some Americans don't understand. When the Soviets use the phrase ""ideological subversion"" what do they mean by it? 


1. YURI BEZMENOV: Ideological subversion is the process which is legitimate and open. You can see it with your own eyes.... It has nothing to do with espionage.

I know that intelligence gathering looks more romantic.... That's probably why your Hollywood producers are so crazy about James Bond types of films. But in reality, the main emphasis of the KGB is NOT in the area of intelligence at all. According to my opinion, and the opinions of many defectors of my calibre, only about 15% of time, money, and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85% is a slow process which we call either ideological subversion, active measures, or psychological warfare. What it basically means is: to change the perception of reality of every American that despite of the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interest of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.

It's a great brainwashing process which goes very slow and is divided into four basic stages. The first one being ""demoralization"". It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation. Why that many years? Because this is the minimum number of years required to educate one generation of students in the country of your enemy exposed to the ideology of [their] enemy. In other words, Marxism-Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generation of American students without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of Americanism; American patriotism....

The result? The result you can see ... the people who graduated in the 60's, dropouts or half-baked intellectuals, are now occupying the positions of power in the government, civil service, business, mass media, and educational systems. You are stuck with them. You can't get through to them. They are contaminated. They are programmed to think and react to certain stimuli in a certain pattern [alluding to Pavlov]. You cannot change their mind even if you expose them to authentic information. Even if you prove that white is white and black is black, you still can not change the basic perception and the logic of behavior.

In other words [for] these people the process of demoralization is complete and irreversible. To rid society of these people you need another 15 or 20 years to educate a new generation of patriotically minded and common sense people who would be acting in favor and in the interests of United States society.

ED: And yet these people who have been programmed and as you say [are] in place and who are favorable to an opening with the Soviet concept - these are the very people who would be marked for extermination in this country?

YURI: Most of them, yes. Simply because the psychological shock when they will see in [the] future what the beautiful society of EQUALITY and social justice means in practice, obviously they will revolt. They will be very unhappy [and] frustrated people, and Marxist-Leninist regime does not tolerate these people. Obviously, they will join the [ranks] of dissenters; dissidents. Unlike the present United States, there will be no place for dissent in future Marxist-Leninist America. [Now] you can get popular like Daniel Elsburg and filthy rich like Jane Fonda for being a dissident [and] for criticizing your Pentagon. In [the] future these people will simply be [he makes a squishy noise] squashed like cockroaches for criticizing the government. Nobody is going to pay them nothing for their beautiful [and] noble ideas of EQUALITY. This they don't understand and it will be the greatest shock for them, of course.

The demoralization process in the United States is basically completed already for the last 25 years. Actually, it's over fulfilled because demoralization now reaches such areas where not even Comrade Andropov and all his experts would even dream of such tremendous success. Most of it is done by Americans to Americans thanks to lack of moral standards. As I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter anymore. A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information. The facts tell nothing to him, even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents and pictures. ...he will refuse to believe it.... That's the tragedy of the situation of demoralization.

The next stage is destabilization.... It only takes 2 to 5 years to destabilize a nation. This time what matters is essentials; economy, foreign relations, [and] defence systems. And you can see it quite clearly that in some... sensitive areas such as defence and [the] economy, the influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas in the United States is absolutely fantastic. I could never believe it 14 years ago when I landed in this part of the world that the process will go that fast.

Most of the American politicians, media, and educational system train another generation of people who think they are living at the peacetime. False. The United States is in a state of war; undeclared, total war against the basic principles and foundations of this system. And the initiator of this war is not Comrade Andropov of course - it's the system. However, ridiculous it may sound, [it is] the world Communist system, or the world Communist conspiracy. Whether I scare some people or not, I don't give a hoot. If you're not scared by now, nothing can scare you.

ED: Okay, so what do we do? What is your recommendation to the American people?

YURI: Well, the immediate thing that comes to mind is, of course, there must be a very strong national effort to educate people in the spirit of REAL patriotism, number one. Number two, to explain [to] them the real danger of socialist, communist, welfare state, Big Brother government.... The moment at least part of [the] United States population is convinced that the danger is real, they have to FORCE their government... to stop aiding Communism.


I think Yuri's spot on, political correctness, identity politics, and cultural Marxism are ruining our countries. We need to purge all of the Marxist professors and start again. We need to do the same as Hungary and stop teaching gender studies. These Marxists present their beliefs attractively. It's all just a matter of being ""sensitive"" to other people, they say. They use words such as ""tolerance"" and ""diversity"", asking, ""Why can't we all just get along?""

The reality is different. Political Correctness is not at all about ""being nice"", unless one thinks gulags are nice places. Political Correctness is Marxism, with all that implies: loss of freedom of expression, thought control, inversion of the traditional social order, and, ultimately, a totalitarian state. If anything, the cultural Marxism created by the Frankfurt School is more horrifying than the old, economic Marxism that ruined Russia. At least the economic Marxists did not exalt sexual perversion and attempt to create a matriarchy, as the Frankfurt School and its descendants have done.﻿""",Aambrick,e958zfe,The_Donald

"Got ""restructured"" recently myself, by an international bank.  Best part was, as I was being bought out -- the bank was starting to preach more about diversity and kumbay-isma, and that we had to stop forcing the Indian workers, in India to work low quality of life, long overnight shifts, that we were treating them like second class people.  So, the initial ""argument"" for offshoring to India was that they would work the same hours as us (daytime in Canada, night time in India, so that we could actually work ""live"" together, using technology, blah, blah, blah...). and for 40-50% less cost.  The actual end game? They are going to axe your middle class jobs in Canada, so that they can create middle class jobs... IN INDIA!!! completely absurd.  Also, the quality of work generated from offshoring was complete crap.  There was always 1 guy in ten who was a star, very smart, worked his ass off -- the rest?  Went home with the bus when their shift was over.  Also, turnover was running greater than 20% in the Indian work force.  Anyone you had who was good, you would lose, unless you promoted then within 6 months -- but then you still had the same problem, re-training him for the new role and training someone to fill his old role.

Voted 4 amnesty. Called the border wall embarrassing. Mocked the Pres for wanting to have it. Does that represent us? I don't think so. 

Pres Trump lowered your taxes. McC voted no. She's voted to raise your taxes over 200 times. Pres Trump fought to roll back regulations on family farms & businesses like the Waters of the US rule. It's gone. Becuz of him.

"Democrats encouraging millions of illegal aliens break our laws & violate borders & they want to sign them up for free healthcare free education & they want to give them the right to vote! I can't imagine why. Dems immigration policies are extremely dangerous reckless. They support catch & release. Free criminal aliens. No protection for Amer workers & tax payers & totally open borders. Crime will pour into our borders.
Illegal immigration cost more than 100 million each yr & that's more than the budgets of MO, IN, & WI combined. I mention those places becuz we have very important races in those races. We have all those Ac Award cameras.
100 heroins 90 cocaine majority of meth & substantial portion of deadly fentanyl come over southern border. These drugs kill more than 70,000 Americans a yr & destory lives of 100s of 1000s of people. Last yr ICE arrested more than 127,000 illegal aliens & they had criminal records including convicted 48,000 assaults 12,000 sex crimes & 1,800 homicides. Dems want to abolish ICE. Want America sanctuary city for gang members & MS13 killers. GOP wants American sanctuary for law abiding citizens not criminals. ",txladyvoter,e95562v,The_Donald

Reason: Power in the Senate is determined by seniority. Feinstein is currently on committees for judiciary, intellegence/border security, and appropriations. If she is voted out, her replacement will be just as crazy dem, but won't be on powerful committees (due to lack of seniority.) instead a more moderate dem may end up on those committees.  If Cali voters keep flipping their senators, we will get more moderate dems in powerful senate committees, and the craziest ones will always be too junior to get important posts.

"Just looking at the numbers for campaign financing is very disheartening. The Republicans on the ballot have not been supported as nearly as much as the Dems.  


For District 50, Ammar raised over 3 million for his campaign and is backed by 14 elected officials.  
Duncan has only raised 1 million, and I've seen no information on backing.

Its even worse for District 52, Scott Peters has Omar Qudrat beat by about 1.5 million.   


Now, obviously, dumping money into a campaign doesn't always produce results. But when it comes to Californians and the bubble that many of them live in (at least from my observation growing up here my entire life), the first thing they hear is what they're going to believe.

"The funny part is that this was something I thought he'd do as soon as he won. ""I won! I'm changing this, I'm changing that. I'm firing you. I'm hiring you."" Every time he speaks, it's about we the people, our group, the republicans, and Americans. Was way surprised by him showing class like this, and I love it! He's done more in this first term alone than several other presidents combined together. If any president deserves the right to talk about himself doing stuff, it's him, and he won't do it unless he's asked specifically about something he did. And even then, he usually tries to word it to make a lot of them having to do with the country as a whole, and not just himself. This is truly a golden age in our country's time, and it's awesome that we have a president who recognizes and talks more about the people than himself! We need to make sure that a single American doesn't take it for granted and goes out to vote tomorrow for the people who are best able to advance his agenda. We owe at the bare minimum that much for all that he's done for us. And hopefully, we can do enough damage to the democrats that they either cease to exist or pull their heads out of their ass and wake up and actually start doing good for our country for once. I doubt either one will happen, but if it is ever going to, it's going to be from this and 2020. And I doubted that Trump would win the 2016 election (I hoped he'd win though. I just didn't think that they'd actually let it happen) so anything is possible. We need to make sure that nobody becomes complacent (except maybe the dems again.

His open borders policy let millions of low wage workers replace people for example in black communities who have seen their unemployment rate reach record lows under Trump.

You don't see how they can effect the economy or are you so boxed in by definitions?

"He was raised in a Muslim school in Indonesia. He grew up praying to Allah five times a day, and he reflects warmly on those times, saying the Islamic call to prayer ""is the most beautiful sound in the world"". He wrote in his book that if the political winds shift, he will stand on the side of Islam. He said that ""the future must not belong to those who would slander the name of the prophet Muhammed"" (a man who took a six-year-old as his fourth wife, but don't talk shit about that!). All of his policies were pro-Islam, and he even changed the mandate of NASA from space exploration to ""Muslim outreach"". His name is Islamic. His father was a Muslim, his step-father was a Muslim, his brothers are Muslim. He referred to ""his (my) Islamic faith"" in an interview with George Stephanopolous, and only retracted that statement when George pressed him to do so. 

I believe he is an atheist (possible Moloch worshipper) with strong Islamic cultural ties and values. If you look at all the data, this explanation seems to fit best.

But the funny thing about names is that the more they're repeated, the more we think of them as just that particular sound and ignore the historical and cultural connotations.

Then in 2008 there was that half-hour commercial Obama aired on every TV network which presented him as this all-American boy who grew up on the streets of middle America. Total propaganda and it was aired simultaneously everywhere for a half hour. But no one talks about it anymore, no one seems to remember it, and I've never been able to find it archived on the Internet. At the time I didn't know much about Obama, other than he was a politician and I don't trust politicians, but that video was really ominous.

"From a fact-checking website: 

Misleading quote: From Audacity of Hope: ""I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction."" 

Actual quote from ""The Audacity of Hope"" [pg. 261]: Of course, not all my conversations in immigrant communities follow this easy pattern. In the wake of 9/11, my meetings with Arab and Pakistani Americans, for example, have a more urgent quality, for the stories of detentions and FBI questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging. They have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly; they need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II, and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction. 

Clearly ""them"" refers to ""Arab and Pakistani Americans"" who are statistically likely to be Muslim, and of course, the entire context of the quote is about Muslims being persecuted if another Islamic terrorist attack on America happens like 9/11. I agree that the full quote in context seems more moderate, but that's sort of Obama's game too. He knows how much he can say and how much he can't so you always have to read between the lines. Same way ""If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor"" had an ellipsis at the end: ""...until the new policy goes into effect."" That's the part Obama didn't say, and removing that part is what makes the statement a lie (a lie of omission), but because he believed we should have assumed he only meant right then, as he was speaking, and not once the policy was implemented, he side-stepped his ownership of the lie and protected his own self-image. 

I think in many ways ISIS was the thing that made the political winds shift in an ""ugly"" direction, and true to form, Obama stood alongside radical Islam in Iran and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, refusing to wipe them out. Refusing to take them seriously. Blowing off the concerns of the people with a joke. Sending them pallets of cash. Releasing their top generals. Trying to give them nukes. Eating a hot dog at a baseball game in his sunglasses with a big smile just hours after an Islamic airport bombing. Etcetera. If it was only this quote, I could give him the benefit of the doubt, but in full context of his performance as President, and everything else he did and said, it explains a lot about who Obama is and where he's coming from. 

I also don't quite understand why the left is so unwilling to concede Obama's ties to Islam. Don't they also say Islam is the most beautiful, most feminist, most peaceful religion ever invented? Don't they say Christianity is bigoted, evil, and violent? So why do they get so upset when someone suggest Obama is Muslim, not Christian? ",sun_wolf,e94yzj8,The_Donald

Dems did this in 2016, which was why a landslide was required and is STILL required. I can't believe we still have to worry whether Deep State has the connections?? to 'tweak' the tabulation figures....


Just as with 2016--if the Dems have any 'surprise' wins we know the vote has been nobbled. There is no momentum or a legit voting force for the demon rats. Just a phony ""its close"" planted  by Fake MSM, who have actors (agents???) posing as journalists paid with quiet Globalist cash.

MY POINT IS....Don't be surprised if he wins like Bernie beat Clinton last year or like Trump beat her on election day. Without the black vote energized, a Republican always has a shot. James being black kind of offsets the fervor to vote Democrat, plus the A-A unemployment us at all time lows.

I remember Reagan. Did you know he got everything he did fighting Democrat majority in the house and the Senate. The amnesty deal was a return for the Democrats voting to secure the border. They just did not hold up their end of the bargain. It was really hard for him to fight anything on the Second Amendment after being shot. And once again having to deal with an opposing majority in both houses. And the bush Dynasty started during JFK. Reagan was the original Maga. He took down the Soviet Union without firing a shot. If he had his way we would have had the Star Wars program in place. Or at least under way during his terms. I did like everything Reagan did. I was in the radio business and he deregulated media in 88 so that we could have the shitshow that we have now. But I know that he was running or knew about project Mockingbird to see how easy it would be for the communist to infiltrate our media. Obviously somebody knew something or we wouldn't be in the boat where in now. Go back and see if you can find anything by David Limbaugh on ronaldus Magnus.,PapaBobJ,e957r3m,The_Donald

Same shit happened to Reagan when he compromised with dems on immigration and then the dems didn't uphold their end of the deal by passing stricter laws on immigration. Reagan later remarked that deal was one of the biggest regrets of his life because he knew he was had, and actually thought he had become real friends with the dems.

The thing is, Democrats were winning in early voting in 2014 and then ended up losing.

"The contrast between coverage of them demonstrates the media’s bias extremely well 

Both are seen by their parties as young, charismatic voices running surprisingly tight races with “momentum” against established figures in the Senate (this is especially true of James with as much as he’s cut his opponent’s lead in the polls over the last months) 

There are some stark differences though. O’Rourke has a criminal record as a result of his drunk driving (and attempt to flee the scene of the crime). In contrast, James— while he has not held office like O’Rourke —is a combat veteran and successful business man. 

And yet despite James service, and business record, it’s O’Rourke who has had the media (outside of Fox News) plastering him everywhere calling him a rockstar

"Liberals are [hypocrites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZXbG5gvoC0).

(**1**) Liberals promote abortion to poor mothers who can't afford diapers, but at the same time liberals are encouraging poor countries to have [anchor babies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9imilqanQ&t=21) in sanctuary cities where all [healthcare and education](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/27/illegal-immigration-costing-record-135-billion-year-study-shows.html) costs are paid for.

(**2**) Liberals want healthy [school lunches](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/11/high-school-students-start-social-media-protest-against-michelle-obamas-lunch-program) and a soda tax to prevent obesity, but then they'll turn around and say, ""Don't fat shame anyone. We need to accept [plus sizes](http://magaimg.net/img/6m2m.png).""

(**3**) Liberals say it's ""cultural appropriation"" for a teenager to wear a [Chinese dress](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a20123163/keziah-daum-prom-dress-cultural-appropriation-cheongsam-qipao), but then they'll [wear a hijab](https://clarionproject.org/feminism-hijabs-and-hypocrisy) to support Muslims.

(**4**) A man has a mental illness if he chops off his own leg ([Body Integrity Identity Disorder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x55IuSyIyQ8)). But liberals insist that an 11-year-old boy who wants to chop off his penis should be encouraged with  ""[hormone blockers](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/17/controversial-therapy-for-young-transgender-patients-raises-questions.html).""

(**5**) DACA kids shouldn't be blamed for the actions of their parents, but liberals say whites have privilege because of their ancestors.

(**6**) Liberals want background checks for gun buyers, but they don't want [voter IDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBxZGWCdgs&t=17) to prevent fraud.

(**7**) Liberals want to ""save the earth"" by reducing pollution, but chain migration will mean more cars, chimneys, and plastic bottles along with the [American lifestyle of consumption](https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2017/05/31/Carbon%20PP.PNG).

(**9**) Giving someone [HIV](https://aidsetc.org/blog/bug-chasers-gay-men-and-intentional-pursuit-hiv-narrative-analysis) is no longer a felony in California.

(**10**) Liberals want to protect the ecosystem by removing [invasive species](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/red-grey-squirrels-cornwall), but they don't care if a foreign culture displaces [native citizens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzZ6--p01KM&t=10).

(**11**) Liberals lock the front door, wear a seatbelt, put a leash on a dog, or use a firewall for the internet. It's normal to think of security, but liberals want to open the border which allows in drug dealers, [sex traffickers](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Human-Trafficking-Soaring-in-Mexico-Rights-Groups-Warn--20171227-0025.html), MS-13 gang members, or Muslim extremists.

If Bernie wants a tax cut, then liberals will endorse it. But if Trump wants a tax cut, then liberals will [reject it in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctz_dHfYfb8&t=24).

(**15**) Liberals say illegals will do all the dirty work, but then they say we'll need a universal basic income because of [AI robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-JR2KDRnEY). So which is it? Import more workers or prepare for [mass unemployment](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6354105)?

(**16**) ""Over 37 percent of House Democrats have practiced school choice, but [96 percent of Democrats](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/congressmen_love_private_school_for_their_kids_) who practiced school choice voted against the voucher program.""

(**17**) Pelosi didn't want to read a [few thousand pages of Obamacare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-05TLiiLU), but Democrats wanted to read a [million documents](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/20/democrat-demand-documents-kavanaugh-obstruction) before Kavanaugh was voted in.

(**18**) Liberals in the #MeToo movement are against sexual harassment, but Hollywood liberals were [cheering for Roman Polanski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXnNOBj26lk&t=49) who raped a 13-year-old girl.

(**19**) Liberals want [girls to join](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/02/boy-scouts-scouts-bsa-girls-joining-cub-scouts/572036002) the Boy Scouts and get [free condoms](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2603273.stm). But liberal feminists wanted [only women](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4546284) at a Wonder Woman screening.

(**20**) [Liberal feminists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZHuFah0uds&t=38) want to break the ""glass ceiling,"" but they become silent when [Muslims oppress women](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3844392). Democrats won't even talk with a reformist who said, ""They completely [ignored us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi8tV9J7Vgo&t=10).""

(**21**) Liberals say that Facebook is a private company that can ban anyone, but then they say a private bakery should be forced to write on a cake for a gay couple.

(**22**) Zuckerberg built a [6-foot-tall wall](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3665223) and picks up [dog poop](http://metro.co.uk/2018/04/03/pictures-mark-zuckerberg-didnt-want-see-7436124).

(**24**) Michael Moore praised [communist Cuba](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article1928212.html), but during his divorce it was revealed that he owned [9 homes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2705149).

(**25**) Obama said, ""There's only [so big a house](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/barack-obama-on-wealth-inequality-only-so-much-you-can-eat.html) you can have."" But the Obamas bought an [$8.1 million mansion](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/news/g2535/obama-new-house-photos) and may own [5 homes](https://dailycaller.com/2016/11/20/the-obamas-just-bought-a-fifth-house-and-this-one-is-really-far-from-home).

(**26**) Democrat Julia Salazar portrayed her family background as poor, but her brother said they grew up in a ""[beautiful neighborhood](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/julia-salazar-brother-mother-question-claims.html).""

(**27**) Liberals are against the [gentrification](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5106811) of urban areas. They don't want old buildings to get renovated with new shops because it would be ""unfair"" to push residents out. The reality is that **rich liberals** have been pushing away **poor liberals** for years by increasing the cost of rent. Democrats block the building of [low-income housing in California](https://sf.curbed.com/2018/1/8/16863362). Democrat Bill de Blasio wouldn't talk with a [homeless woman in New York](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6246457).

(**28**) Liberals want illegals to flow in and vote Democrat, but liberals won't talk about solutions to stabilize the 3rd World. Birth rates decline naturally the richer a nation gets, but liberals don't want to industrialize other countries because of climate change. [Obama said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlgMwxcsOOE) poor Africans can't have cars or air conditioners. Meanwhile rich liberals like [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9xFFyUOpXo&t=7) use a sports car, [private jet](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3044176), or yacht.

"The thing is communism is a form of socialism.  Fascism is also a form of socialism.  In communism the government controls everything, the economy and the means of production.  In fascism the government controls the economy, but they allow private ownership of stuff, including factories and farms.  Of course, you don't really own anything except what the government allows you to own, naturally, with the government picking the economic winners and losers.  It would be more correct if the sign said ""fascism leads to communism"" although the opposite seems to be true.",AthanofAlex,e95tr3x,The_Donald

"But they are openly running as fascists.  Democratic Socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are obvious fascists.

I saw that there was a “die-in” protest on market and 5th and market and 6th that basically had us surrounded, and that’s why so few patrons were in our establishment.  I told my coworkers about it and they started complaining about the protestors and how annoying it was that they were blocking our way to work and affecting our business and profit margins.  Then one of my coworkers said “did you see that abortion protestor who roundhouse kicked that pro-life lady?  What a psycho!”  And the entire group agreed that these liberal protestors were nut jobs.  Everyone said that they needed to “get a job” and “get a life”.

"God I hate this issue. It’s a classic no win situation. 

We aren’t racist but we are culteralist (meaning some cultures suck while America’s and Western Europe’s rock when not yoked by communism). 

But you can’t explain that without sounding racist cause all the 3rd world tribal shitholes are where brown people live. So we end up undermining part of our value system (MLKs dream of looking at character not race) by going all “Nuh uh, I’ve got black friends. Here I’ll show you pictures!!!!”

Which marginalizes them as tokens and makes us look like desperate idiots in the process by taking the accusations seriously in the first place. 

Seriously, YOU CAN NOT WIN THIS GAME. STOP PLAYING. 

God help you if you try, for example if this subject came up at work tomorrow and i said out loud in response to somebody saying “What makes America great is we’re a melting pot!!” This simple historical fact:

Until the late 1980s America was over 80% non-Hispanic white. Very little of note has been provided from foundation through maturity of our country by anyone not black or European white.

We focused on admitting a controlled number of immigrants on a yearly basis based in part on their national origin in proportion to the existing American population. The goal was to avoid allowing in so many people so fast that it altered our national character. Hart-Celler was put in place in '65 based in part on what were later admitted lies - that altering immigration policy to the mess we have now wouldn't alter the population. America was about 88% white in 1965. It was about 89% white in 1910. In 2010, it was 72% white. So the US was essentially a white nation with a black minority (always making up around 10-13% of the population) and then after 1965's disastrous changes to immigration law, we've begun to lose that character at a dangerously rapid pace.

"Well let me be completely clear on something here. 

The argument, as such, was whether IQ or culture was ultimately responsible for making places shitholes. Nobody was arguing that there’s not severe maybe even unfixable problems with certain places. 

But the answer to “what created this culture?” 

Is tribalism is the natural state of humanity. Europe was engaged in tribalism for a long time as well. France and Russia are named for respectively the Frankish and Rus people (Frankish and Rus tribes in other words). This is an alien concept to most people today as the roots of what made Europe powerful aren’t considered important to teach anymore. And white people are just white people, right?

I mean how many times in your life have you heard a white person describe themselves by their tribe? Probably never right? They’d say their country right? German or Scottish, they wouldn’t say Vandals or Celts. If you’re older you might remember WASP - white Anglo-Saxon Protestant used, it means direct descendants of English origin. As opposed to inferior whites like the Irish or Welsh or Cornish (all tribes of the British Isles). 

It’s a relatively recent phenomenon, that country comes first over tribe. And it was a unique confluence of philosophy, law, and religion that made that happen. America being singularly unique in taking all different European tribes and successfully melding them together under these principles. How that was accomplished is too lengthy to list, but a lot of it was by force. 

Anyways, that’s what I was getting at. What we have is different and we’re not going to force anyone who comes here to assimilate, which makes the whole thing impossible. And point of fact, bringing in tribal peoples in mass numbers would be disastrous to our culture. The same way bringing in neo-socialist descendants of Spain is disastrous. Latin countries (I mean original ones like Spain/Italy) have a different historical culture and rule of law than North / North Western Europeans do. Simply put English/Germanic common law was superior to French/Spanish/Italian or Roman collectively common law. 

If we say IQ is directly responsible for the failure to move past tribalism, then it doesn’t inherently change the argument. Simply elucidates it. 

I have no idea if the above is a coherent logical start-finish explanation or random jumble of thoughts but I typed it all up so fuck it I’m hitting send. 

Spez: mostly coherent. What I failed to explain was how that’s different. In America we celebrate St Patties day and Octoberfest to honor the culture and people of Germany/Ireland who make up part of this country. The rest of the days we go back to not giving a shit where your ancestors are from. In Rawanda, the Hutus and Tutsi’s fuck each other in the ass at every possible opportunity when one has power over the other. That’s nationalism vs tribalism.

What is your proof that the successful ones vote Democrat? And what exactly are you classifying as successful?

&#x200B;

\>Even without Trump's stance on China they vote heavily Democrat. 

&#x200B;

What are you talking about. From the picture you showed before their was a clear effect of them voting for Hillary more than most Asians, Ah never mind your not actually making a argument here you just switch to a different subject in the next sentence.

&#x200B;

\>Because they want more Chinese and Indians to pour into US and change our demographics forever. 

&#x200B;

To think like this one must have no morals. Which is not the majority of people. Even then someone with no morals shouldn't give a shit about socialization. So the actual number of people that believe this is... Quite small to say the least.

&#x200B;

\>There are over a billion Chinese in China, do we want a billion based Chinese democrats in America too?

It's very interesting you say this actually. Since your implying that most Chinese people are smart enough to get in with merit based immigration.

* And, I believe their violence be well worse than we have seen in the last 2 years

Mark my words...the crushing defeat that the Dems properly deserve will be a prelude to a civil war that the Democratic party, their accomplices in media/social media, and their foot soldiers (i.e., Antifa) have been sowing the seeds for over the last 2 years.

Remember, whether the Left wins or loses, their political foes must be punished or eliminated.

"I grew up just outside Gary, IN.  Back before the 1960's, Gary was a thriving, beautiful city with a downtown business district, theaters, good schools and of course, the steel plants and associated manufacturing.  Much like Detroit, there have been decades of corruption, mismanagement and neglect.  The good people of Gary have either left the area or remain only because they have no other options.  It's a sad story, but not unlike that of many other forsaken/forgotten cities.  I hope that one day it can return to some form of its prior glory.",JoeyCora28,e94ojyj,The_Donald

"C-SPAN has been a cable network for decades, I'm sure they a paying the proper royalties for music. Youtube has an automated system that identifies copyrighted music and video. It works using similar technology that apps like Shazam use. This system was first set up years ago in response to the Viacom vs YouTube lawsuit. Depending on the copyright holder's demands, Youtube will either remove your content entirely, disable ad revenue or mute the audio.  The system is far from perfect, there are many false positives or times when the copyrighted content would fall under fair use. But with the amount of content on the site it would be impossible for them to evaluate things individually. Cable networks that have YouTube channels have their channels set up in a way that their licensed content will not be removed.  
  
There are plenty of reasons to hate Youtube, demonetization and banning of conservatives. But you should direct your hate at the music industry for why RSBN can't play copyrighted music on their streams even though it probably falls under fair use.",bigleaguetrump,e94kjpz,The_Donald

"And, I think in 2016, Todd Young ran against Evan Bayh for senate. Bayh got out after he said it was too much D vs R, and abandoned the people. Then he tried to get back into it, only to lose to Young, by a pretty decent margin. Donnelly doesn't stand a chance. Only reason he won in 2012 was cause he came off as a moderate, and didn't have much of a voter record. Now that he does have a voting record, we can see that he isn't the moderate he says he is. 

&#x200B;

Only chance Donnelly has is if people vote for Brenton instead of Braun. I like and agree with a lot of the stances Brenton has, but I won't ever vote for a 3rd party. Don't listen to the ads, if you're a conservative, vote Braun, because Braun will stick up for you and will MAGA, Donnelly will continue to be a puppet for Pelosi and Schumer.

"Democrats care about the environment as much as they care about black people and other minorities: not at all. It's all about virtue signalling in public and accumulating political power in private. Actually improving the environment isn't really on their list of things to do, which is why the environment tanks under them in the same way the lives of black people tank under them. 

All this pandering and manipulation is actually worse than doing nothing because they keep creating the illusion that they are helping. It makes people look the other way and assume ""oh, the Democrats are taking care of it"". *But they aren't*. 

""Vote for me if you want to save the planet."" I mean it's ridiculous. It's all a sham. They say what they need to say to get power and then they piss off for four years. All talk, no action. ",sun_wolf,e94qhvl,The_Donald
"All this talk about the planet and not enough about the world.

""Planet"" only refers to the literal rock we are standing on. It means ""wanderer"" in Greek, referring the fact that the planets move through space. In the context of Earth, it's a cold, sterile word with no acknowledgement of the presence of thinking life.

""World"" refers to the home of humans. In Anglo-Saxon, it means ""the place where men (*wer-)* grow old *(-eald)""*. A really much more humane term that acknowledges the important relationship between humans and their home.

Talk about ""de-humanizing language."" Those other ones up there are planets; ours is a world. Without us, Earth would still be a planet, but it would not be a world.",GodSaveEmperorTrump,e94wj4t,The_Donald

"Name-calling worked so well, for so long. It was the crucifix that paralyzed and terrified the evil Republican vampires every time. Democrats did not even have to use the names sometimes. Just fingering the cross made the monsters jump away and hiss. Then there came a time that the priests stood up against the head vampire, Count Trumpula. They smirked and hauled out their crosses, sprayed holy water, hollered out passages from the Book Of Alinsky. And he laughed. Grabbed a crucifix and crumpled it. The other vampires muttered among themselves. Lindsey, the most shy of vampires, said “Can we do that?” The Count smiled. “Of course; you always could!” The clergy was agape. They wailed, “Now he’ll drink our blood!” Trumpula straightened his vest a bit. “Actually it was you that always did that, not us. And worse! We’ll be looking into your conduct soon.” The flock scattered. And to the vampires he said,”You were always the heroes of your own story. Write it yourselves.” And Lindsey led the way out into the daylight. A banshee wailed its most wretched curse. It sounded to him like gay music. He thought of all the times he had hid from the sun.

No reason to discriminate against the language barrier. Language is not the same as knowledge or legality. Would it not be better to have people actually know what they are voting for to make a knowledgeable decision, as opposed to filling in random circles and voting what the idiot dems on the TV tell them to do?

Only citizens should be allowed to vote. But not all citizens are fluent in English. The whole ""you live here, speak English or go back to where you came from"" thing is kind of mean.

On the other hand.... And this is what I HATE: When people are actually fluent in English but use another language when there are other people around in a situation where non-English speakers can't participate in the conversation intentionally. Its fucking rude.",AzrielK,e95d6w6,The_Donald

"That's how many they let in. According to my friend who's a Captain with the  Macon Bibb Fire department they estimated a hundred thousand people showed up. No riots, no looting  no unusual accidents. Folks outside were just as happy as the ones inside. It was a sea of red maga hats in every restuarant from Macon to Warner Robins all day long. 

The Macon Bibb city council, all black Democrats, held a news conference literally spewing out the same lines the national party does. Trump is hate, Trump is racist. No one showed up to support them. The walk away movement is strong here. The black community is waking up to the reality that their investment in the Democrats leads to nothing, literally nothing,  no jobs, no way out of poverty, no way to clean up the corruption in their neighborhoods or get a fair shake in the courts. Meanwhile since Trump was elected jobs are returning,  wages are going up, and opportunities are rising. If Trump can do this with all the hate hes faced what can he do with fewer Democrats around is what these people are asking now.

70 years. Its been 70 years and the lives of black folks haven't improved with Democrats. The improvements all came from the other side. Black folks see what the dems are doing trying to import thousands of poor Latino illegals to take their place. Meanwhile their men all go to prison, their families are split up, and despite higher birth rates they still have no net gain in their percentage of the US population. 

Do you know who's really responsible for the walk away movement? Barak Hussein Obama. He proved that we really do want black Americans to feel and be involved in this nations leadership and direction. He also proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that getting black people to the top in the DNC does absolutely nothing for poor black people except make their lives harder. He broke the illusion that once ""someone like me"" gets there things will be different for all of us. Things only got worse. He opened the eyes and ears and once that red pill is taken it can't be untaken. Better ideas and the truth finally got past the narrative.  Thanks Obama.

Gotta wonder about the crowds you prowl if you're getting pussy hat types, though.

Never saw one myself, weren't crazies I could see at and I wonder about the ability to be a DC-type (just came up with this, probably not original, hopefully offensive: ""'Active Cock' versus 'Dildo Cock'"" - let the crazies go nuts figuring that out while everyone else screws whoever *they want.*

It’s actual a matter of debate. Under title VII and other anti discrimination laws the protected class that would apply is “sex.” Whether “sex” includes “sexual orientation” or just means gender is up to the regulatory agencies and those are subject to the executive branch in office. I haven’t checked what the Trump administration has said but Bush explicitly said sex just means gender and the Obama administration explicitly said it includes sexual orientation. ,RetainedByLucifer,e94dkqs,The_Donald
"> I’m open to having my mind changed but I figure you could sue over any type of discrimination, especially for sexual orientation. Because it’s illegal.

Nope.  The way the law works is that anything not explicitly made illegal is legal.  In most states, it's still perfectly legal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.  Generally, when people push for it, Republicans oppose it on the basis of religious freedom, or try to get carveouts.

They don't have to make it legal, simply not make it illegal.  Legally, that puts it in the same category as freckles or red hair, both of which it's entirely legal to discriminate against someone for.  Family status (married/unmarried) are illegal, as is age (for old people), as is sex.  Sexual orientation is not illegal.

Obama tried to make existing sex discrimination laws about sexual orientation, but that's one of the policies President Trump is rescinding.  That's not what the law says.",Acceptable_Volume,e953wcw,The_Donald

There actually is a fair amount of precedent on the issue but the cases often if not always fall to EEOC guidance to form the decision. This is the regulatory body that puts out most of the federal guidance on the issue (every state may have their own).

Sherrif Arpaio got him a second time but he was using Guitierez alias. Arpaio released him to ICE who due to broken immigration system released him to the streets. Then in 2014 after years of deportations and arrests since 1996 he killed two cops while on meth. Basically Trump is blaming broken immigration system I.e Democrats for Luis remaining in the states.

"Yeah, Chrysler broke off RAM from Dodge as its own brand 8 years ago after the Fiat merger, so Dodge can focus on cars/SUV and Ram on trucks/heavy duty...  but Dodge used the RAM logo on it's fleet of cars before the spin off so plenty still associate Dodge with RAM ... the split has worked out great though, sales for both sides increased dramatically, RAM market share which was stagnent/falling doubled in the first 5 years and now threatens Chevy, and has actually outsold Chevy in some periods...

I tell you what though, I love this fucking truck. It's got the 5.7 Hemi sounds and drives awesome. Gets virtually the same gas mileage as a smaller V6 Tacoma too, when cruising at a sustained speed it shuts down 4 cylinders and runs on 4 to sip on gas, and you don't even notice the switching is flawless as soon as you touch the gas, plus the 8 speed transmission is a saver too and gives better acceleration than a 5 -- improving fuel economy without sacrificing power and increasing acceleration????

Avenatti fell prey to the SLAPP trap, ergo it was thrown out under Texas Anti-SLAPP statute. 

(SLAPP: Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation)

From the order:

>Plaintiff has capitalized on her dispute with Mr. Trump, embarking on a nationwide tour of adult live entertainment venues for which she admittedly is being paid at least four times her normal appearance fee, an extensive publicity campaign against Mr. Trump, which has included appearances on 60 Minutes, The View and Saturday Night Live, and the publication of a book. [ECF No. 28-1, Exs. B-E, J, P-Q; ECF No. 87-1 (Dec. Relief Action), Ex. H.]
>
>The conduct of Plaintiff and her counsel suggest they will continue to bring similar claims and meritless lawsuits against Mr. Trump, if sufficient sanctions do not deter them from doing so….
>
>Accordingly, Mr. Trump requests that the Court consider the conduct and statements of Plaintiff and her counsel, and the benefits they have received from maintaining a dispute against Mr. Trump, and enter a sanctions award of an amount equal to or greater than the fee award, to deter Plaintiff from bring similar meritless actions in the future.

(**3**) Liberals say it's ""cultural appropriation"" for a teenager to wear a [Chinese dress](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a20123163/keziah-daum-prom-dress-cultural-appropriation-cheongsam-qipao), but then they'll [wear a hijab](https://clarionproject.org/feminism-hijabs-and-hypocrisy) to support Muslims.

(**4**) A man has a mental illness if he chops off his own leg ([Body Integrity Identity Disorder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x55IuSyIyQ8)). But liberals insist that an 11-year-old boy who wants to chop off his penis should be encouraged with  ""[hormone blockers](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/17/controversial-therapy-for-young-transgender-patients-raises-questions.html).""

(**5**) DACA kids shouldn't be blamed for the actions of their parents, but liberals say whites have privilege because of their ancestors.

(**6**) Liberals want background checks for gun buyers, but they don't want [voter IDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBxZGWCdgs&t=17) to prevent fraud.

(**7**) Liberals want to ""save the earth"" by reducing pollution, but chain migration will mean more cars, chimneys, and plastic bottles along with the [American lifestyle of consumption](https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2017/05/31/Carbon%20PP.PNG). Poor refugees in mud huts will want a TV, iphone, and microwave oven. This will increase [carbon emissions](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-india-2012-vs-india-2016-the-comparison-between-these-pics-from-nasa-shows-modi-s-india-is-truly-shining-2400572).

(**8**) Liberals want vaccinations for everyone's health, but the illegals are bringing diseases. ""People from Central and South America, ground zero for [Zika and other infectious diseases](http://canadafreepress.com/article/obamas-refugees-and-surging-deadly-diseases-in-america) including tuberculosis, dengue, Chagas, Chikungunya and schistosomiasis, make up nearly 15 percent of the illegal-immigrant population"".

(**9**) Giving someone [HIV](https://aidsetc.org/blog/bug-chasers-gay-men-and-intentional-pursuit-hiv-narrative-analysis) is no longer a felony in California. Sexual diseases are now spreading faster there, but liberals think it's because of ""[racism and stigma](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-std-stigma-20180507-htmlstory.html).""

(**10**) Liberals want to protect the ecosystem by removing [invasive species](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/red-grey-squirrels-cornwall), but they don't care if a foreign culture displaces [native citizens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzZ6--p01KM&t=10).

(**11**) Liberals lock the front door, wear a seatbelt, put a leash on a dog, or use a firewall for the internet. It's normal to think of security, but liberals want to open the border which allows in drug dealers, [sex traffickers](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Human-Trafficking-Soaring-in-Mexico-Rights-Groups-Warn--20171227-0025.html), MS-13 gang members, or Muslim extremists.

(**12**) Liberals want a minimum wage of $15 per hour, but illegals are taking jobs for ""[$5 to $6 an hour](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-06/californias-undocumented-workers-help-grow-economy-theres-cost)"" without paying [tax](https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/james-agresti/about-61-million-illegals-filed-taxes-us-many-didnt-pay-received-refunds).

(**13**) [Nancy Pelosi](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/15/pelosi-slams-company-bonuses-as-crumbs-despite-once-praising-40-tax-cut.html) wrote that Obama's $40 tax cut per paycheck was a ""victory"" that ""will make a difference."" But now she says $2,000 from Trump's tax cut would be ""crumbs"" that are ""pathetic"" and ""insignificant.""

(**14**) Bernie Sanders owns [3 houses](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2016/08/08/bernie-sanders-buys-a-summer-home-in-north-hero), made over [$2 million](https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-makes-one-million-dollars-second-straight-year-book-deals-992845) in 2 years, and paid only [4% to charity](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/15/sanders-gave-4-percent-income-to-charity-in-2014-tax-returns-show.html) in 2014. If Bernie wants a tax cut, then liberals will endorse it. But if Trump wants a tax cut, then liberals will [reject it in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctz_dHfYfb8&t=24).

(**15**) Liberals say illegals will do all the dirty work, but then they say we'll need a universal basic income because of [AI robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-JR2KDRnEY). So which is it? Import more workers or prepare for [mass unemployment](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6354105)?

(**16**) ""Over 37 percent of House Democrats have practiced school choice, but [96 percent of Democrats](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/congressmen_love_private_school_for_their_kids_) who practiced school choice voted against the voucher program.""

(**17**) Pelosi didn't want to read a [few thousand pages of Obamacare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-05TLiiLU), but Democrats wanted to read a [million documents](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/20/democrat-demand-documents-kavanaugh-obstruction) before Kavanaugh was voted in.

(**18**) Liberals in the #MeToo movement are against sexual harassment, but Hollywood liberals were [cheering for Roman Polanski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXnNOBj26lk&t=49) who raped a 13-year-old girl.

(**19**) Liberals want [girls to join](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/02/boy-scouts-scouts-bsa-girls-joining-cub-scouts/572036002) the Boy Scouts and get [free condoms](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2603273.stm). But liberal feminists wanted [only women](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4546284) at a Wonder Woman screening.

(**20**) [Liberal feminists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZHuFah0uds&t=38) want to break the ""glass ceiling,"" but they become silent when [Muslims oppress women](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3844392). Democrats won't even talk with a reformist who said, ""They completely [ignored us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi8tV9J7Vgo&t=10).""

(**21**) Liberals say that Facebook is a private company that can ban anyone, but then they say a private bakery should be forced to write on a cake for a gay couple.

(**22**) Zuckerberg built a [6-foot-tall wall](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3665223) and picks up [dog poop](http://metro.co.uk/2018/04/03/pictures-mark-zuckerberg-didnt-want-see-7436124). He cares about his own privacy but [ignores user privacy](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/10/mark-zuckerberg-walls-off-his-house-but-ignores-users-privacy-apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says.html).

(**23**) Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey protests the [redistribution of his wealth](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6298961).

(**24**) Michael Moore praised [communist Cuba](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article1928212.html), but during his divorce it was revealed that he owned [9 homes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2705149).

(**25**) Obama said, ""There's only [so big a house](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/barack-obama-on-wealth-inequality-only-so-much-you-can-eat.html) you can have."" But the Obamas bought an [$8.1 million mansion](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/news/g2535/obama-new-house-photos) and may own [5 homes](https://dailycaller.com/2016/11/20/the-obamas-just-bought-a-fifth-house-and-this-one-is-really-far-from-home).

(**26**) Democrat Julia Salazar portrayed her family background as poor, but her brother said they grew up in a ""[beautiful neighborhood](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/julia-salazar-brother-mother-question-claims.html).""

(**27**) Liberals are against the [gentrification](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5106811) of urban areas. They don't want old buildings to get renovated with new shops because it would be ""unfair"" to push residents out. The reality is that **rich liberals** have been pushing away **poor liberals** for years by increasing the cost of rent. Democrats block the building of [low-income housing in California](https://sf.curbed.com/2018/1/8/16863362). Democrat Bill de Blasio wouldn't talk with a [homeless woman in New York](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6246457).

(**28**) Liberals want illegals to flow in and vote Democrat, but liberals won't talk about solutions to stabilize the 3rd World. Birth rates decline naturally the richer a nation gets, but liberals don't want to industrialize other countries because of climate change. [Obama said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlgMwxcsOOE) poor Africans can't have cars or air conditioners. Meanwhile rich liberals like [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9xFFyUOpXo&t=7) use a sports car, [private jet](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3044176), or yacht.

And they are actually never looking for something to actually fix, since nothing is really broken except patriarchy.

Conversely, Republicans are always looking for something to fix, and fixing it. We're NOT looking for the silver lining, we're realists that know this world will never be or achieve Utopia, so let's work within the real world and make things better, and not some leftist vision of what could be; if only we elected the right candidate, or passed the right law, all will be Wonderful.",Deplorabus,e94o8rq,The_Donald

"Illegal immigration has multiple issues to it.  First is security.  Do you want to live next to a MS-13 gang member?  Do you want someone to come in who doesn't believe in freedom of religion or speech, and will kill you if you insult their god?  Do you want someone coming in who wants gays to be killed?  Do you want someone smuggling in prostitutes and sex slaves from 3rd world counties?  Legal immigration has a vetting process.  Illegal immigration lets anyone in without any vetting and criminal background checks.  

Second is wage exploitation.  Companies pay illegals 40% less than market rate.  This causes higher unemployment in these industries and you have American lives destroyed.  It also causes low wage growth because companies don't need to pay more for workers because new illegals are coming in everyday.

Third is taxpayer support.  Illegals consume government resources but don't pay any income, SS, medicare taxes.  This eats up government funds.

"Liberals are [hypocrites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZXbG5gvoC0).

(**1**) Liberals promote abortion to poor mothers who can't afford diapers, but at the same time liberals are encouraging poor countries to have [anchor babies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9imilqanQ&t=21) in sanctuary cities where all [healthcare and education](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/27/illegal-immigration-costing-record-135-billion-year-study-shows.html) costs are paid for.

(**2**) Liberals want healthy [school lunches](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/11/high-school-students-start-social-media-protest-against-michelle-obamas-lunch-program) and a soda tax to prevent obesity, but then they'll turn around and say, ""Don't fat shame anyone. We need to accept [plus sizes](http://magaimg.net/img/6m2m.png).""

(**3**) Liberals say it's ""cultural appropriation"" for a teenager to wear a [Chinese dress](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a20123163/keziah-daum-prom-dress-cultural-appropriation-cheongsam-qipao), but then they'll [wear a hijab](https://clarionproject.org/feminism-hijabs-and-hypocrisy) to support Muslims.

(**4**) A man has a mental illness if he chops off his own leg ([Body Integrity Identity Disorder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x55IuSyIyQ8)). But liberals insist that an 11-year-old boy who wants to chop off his penis should be encouraged with  ""[hormone blockers](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/17/controversial-therapy-for-young-transgender-patients-raises-questions.html).""

(**5**) DACA kids shouldn't be blamed for the actions of their parents, but liberals say whites have privilege because of their ancestors.

(**6**) Liberals want background checks for gun buyers, but they don't want [voter IDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBxZGWCdgs&t=17) to prevent fraud.

(**7**) Liberals want to ""save the earth"" by reducing pollution, but chain migration will mean more cars, chimneys, and plastic bottles along with the [American lifestyle of consumption](https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2017/05/31/Carbon%20PP.PNG). Poor refugees in mud huts will want a TV, iphone, and microwave oven. This will increase [carbon emissions](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-india-2012-vs-india-2016-the-comparison-between-these-pics-from-nasa-shows-modi-s-india-is-truly-shining-2400572).

(**8**) Liberals want vaccinations for everyone's health, but the illegals are bringing diseases. ""People from Central and South America, ground zero for [Zika and other infectious diseases](http://canadafreepress.com/article/obamas-refugees-and-surging-deadly-diseases-in-america) including tuberculosis, dengue, Chagas, Chikungunya and schistosomiasis, make up nearly 15 percent of the illegal-immigrant population"".

(**9**) Giving someone [HIV](https://aidsetc.org/blog/bug-chasers-gay-men-and-intentional-pursuit-hiv-narrative-analysis) is no longer a felony in California. Sexual diseases are now spreading faster there, but liberals think it's because of ""[racism and stigma](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-std-stigma-20180507-htmlstory.html).""

(**10**) Liberals want to protect the ecosystem by removing [invasive species](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/red-grey-squirrels-cornwall), but they don't care if a foreign culture displaces [native citizens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzZ6--p01KM&t=10).

(**11**) Liberals lock the front door, wear a seatbelt, put a leash on a dog, or use a firewall for the internet. It's normal to think of security, but liberals want to open the border which allows in drug dealers, [sex traffickers](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Human-Trafficking-Soaring-in-Mexico-Rights-Groups-Warn--20171227-0025.html), MS-13 gang members, or Muslim extremists.

(**12**) Liberals want a minimum wage of $15 per hour, but illegals are taking jobs for ""[$5 to $6 an hour](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-06/californias-undocumented-workers-help-grow-economy-theres-cost)"" without paying [tax](https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/james-agresti/about-61-million-illegals-filed-taxes-us-many-didnt-pay-received-refunds).

(**13**) [Nancy Pelosi](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/15/pelosi-slams-company-bonuses-as-crumbs-despite-once-praising-40-tax-cut.html) wrote that Obama's $40 tax cut per paycheck was a ""victory"" that ""will make a difference."" But now she says $2,000 from Trump's tax cut would be ""crumbs"" that are ""pathetic"" and ""insignificant.""

(**14**) Bernie Sanders owns [3 houses](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2016/08/08/bernie-sanders-buys-a-summer-home-in-north-hero), made over [$2 million](https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-makes-one-million-dollars-second-straight-year-book-deals-992845) in 2 years, and paid only [4% to charity](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/15/sanders-gave-4-percent-income-to-charity-in-2014-tax-returns-show.html) in 2014. If Bernie wants a tax cut, then liberals will endorse it. But if Trump wants a tax cut, then liberals will [reject it in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctz_dHfYfb8&t=24).

(**15**) Liberals say illegals will do all the dirty work, but then they say we'll need a universal basic income because of [AI robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-JR2KDRnEY). So which is it? Import more workers or prepare for [mass unemployment](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6354105)?

(**16**) ""Over 37 percent of House Democrats have practiced school choice, but [96 percent of Democrats](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/congressmen_love_private_school_for_their_kids_) who practiced school choice voted against the voucher program.""

(**17**) Pelosi didn't want to read a [few thousand pages of Obamacare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-05TLiiLU), but Democrats wanted to read a [million documents](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/20/democrat-demand-documents-kavanaugh-obstruction) before Kavanaugh was voted in.

(**18**) Liberals in the #MeToo movement are against sexual harassment, but Hollywood liberals were [cheering for Roman Polanski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXnNOBj26lk&t=49) who raped a 13-year-old girl.

(**19**) Liberals want [girls to join](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/02/boy-scouts-scouts-bsa-girls-joining-cub-scouts/572036002) the Boy Scouts and get [free condoms](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2603273.stm). But liberal feminists wanted [only women](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4546284) at a Wonder Woman screening.

(**20**) [Liberal feminists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZHuFah0uds&t=38) want to break the ""glass ceiling,"" but they become silent when [Muslims oppress women](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3844392). Democrats won't even talk with a reformist who said, ""They completely [ignored us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi8tV9J7Vgo&t=10).""

(**21**) Liberals say that Facebook is a private company that can ban anyone, but then they say a private bakery should be forced to write on a cake for a gay couple.

(**22**) Zuckerberg built a [6-foot-tall wall](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3665223) and picks up [dog poop](http://metro.co.uk/2018/04/03/pictures-mark-zuckerberg-didnt-want-see-7436124). He cares about his own privacy but [ignores user privacy](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/10/mark-zuckerberg-walls-off-his-house-but-ignores-users-privacy-apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says.html).

(**23**) Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey protests the [redistribution of his wealth](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6298961).

(**24**) Michael Moore praised [communist Cuba](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article1928212.html), but during his divorce it was revealed that he owned [9 homes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2705149).

(**25**) Obama said, ""There's only [so big a house](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/barack-obama-on-wealth-inequality-only-so-much-you-can-eat.html) you can have."" But the Obamas bought an [$8.1 million mansion](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/news/g2535/obama-new-house-photos) and may own [5 homes](https://dailycaller.com/2016/11/20/the-obamas-just-bought-a-fifth-house-and-this-one-is-really-far-from-home).

(**26**) Democrat Julia Salazar portrayed her family background as poor, but her brother said they grew up in a ""[beautiful neighborhood](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/julia-salazar-brother-mother-question-claims.html).""

(**27**) Liberals are against the [gentrification](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5106811) of urban areas. They don't want old buildings to get renovated with new shops because it would be ""unfair"" to push residents out. The reality is that **rich liberals** have been pushing away **poor liberals** for years by increasing the cost of rent. Democrats block the building of [low-income housing in California](https://sf.curbed.com/2018/1/8/16863362). Democrat Bill de Blasio wouldn't talk with a [homeless woman in New York](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6246457).

(**28**) Liberals want illegals to flow in and vote Democrat, but liberals won't talk about solutions to stabilize the 3rd World. Birth rates decline naturally the richer a nation gets, but liberals don't want to industrialize other countries because of climate change. [Obama said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlgMwxcsOOE) poor Africans can't have cars or air conditioners. Meanwhile rich liberals like [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9xFFyUOpXo&t=7) use a sports car, [private jet](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3044176), or yacht.

&nbsp;

Liberals think we can smile, hold hands, and *live happily ever after* in a socialist utopia. The reality is that [naive liberals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u4Vlgr2iHs&t=8) support more taxes, regulations, and identity politics.",bsmith76,e93y6ea,The_Donald

I figure;

2024 - Pence POTUS, Trump VP.

2040 - Either Ivanka or DJT Jr.; whoever didn’t go in 2032.

2048 - Eric Trump.

>Two Anne Arundel County (MD) police officers serving one of the new “red flag” protective orders to remove guns from a house killed a Ferndale man after he refused to give up his gun.

>(A niece) said her uncle “likes to speak his mind,” but she described him as harmless. She said one of her aunts requested the protective order to temporarily remove his guns.
>The new protective orders, which family members, **police or others may seek to temporarily prohibit people’s access to firearms when they show red flags that they are a danger to themselves or others**, went into effect Oct. 1.

There’s another section where right after a section on Islam they criticize the Catholic Church for idolatry in Spain as if to say *wink wink* Islam does it better.

Yep there are multiple trump supporters that have Netflix.  And I canceled for over 6 months when they first started their shit.  But I know Netflix works for our family and we started the service again.  There is something to be said for simply not watching the shows you disagree with and supporting the ones like House of Cards that make an attempt to be fair.  If I don't pay for their service then why would they care for my opinion on their service?  If paying subscribers don't watch their political propaganda eventually they might stop producing it.  You have to have a seat at the table in order for your opinion to matter.  I was respect both approaches because I have taken both myself.  ,4don2016,e94hy3e,The_Donald

"It's the right to vote that they like the best. There's only one way to end this lawless assault on our dignity sovereignty on our borders by voting GOP. Illegal immigration costs more than 100B every single yr more than OH MT & WY all places I've been. 

Dems endanger every Amer community. Heroin thru southern border along with cocaine majority of meth & substantial portion of deadly fentanyl. These drugs kill more than 70,000 Amer a yr, destroy 100's of thousands of lives & OH knows it more than almost any other state in union.

Last yr 127,000 arrest by ICE officers. Even Jim Jordan w/b afraid of some of these ICE people. Naw, he's not a good example. 127,000 aliens with criminal records were thrown out last yr or put in prison by ICE. Who else is gonna do that? Chgd & convicted of 48,000 assaults 12,000 sex crimes & 1,800 homicides. Other than that, they're very fine people. 

You think we're letting that caravan come into this country? You can forget letting those caravans into our country. Dems want giant sanct city for drug dealers & MS13 gangs. GOP want Amer sanct city for law abiding Americans.

For years, these dems have complained that voting was too difficult for many people, so they got their way and special means of voting was made, such as mail-in/absentee/etc. Then, dems complained voting on one single day was too difficult for people, so they got their way and early voting was implemented.

It doesn't happen overnight. It's a slow, gradual, constant process that slowly grinds freedom of speech and freedom of expression into dust. I don't think most people realize just *how bad* things have become. Simply supporting the sitting president (who has above a 50% approval rating) is grounds for social media account suspensions and bans. Hell, simply telling people *they don't have to vote democrat* resulted in said entire movement being nuked from Cuckbook altogether. 




This ad needs to be seen by Americans, and that is precisely why it is being censored so heavily. A wise man once told me ""The only reason to want censorship is because your own ideas suck"". This is exactly what is happening in our country today; globalist democrat sellouts know their ideas don't benefit American voters, so they are doing everything they can to silence their opposition.

So then are CNN and NBC saying that a non-white American citizen can commit some horrific crime here and then try to illegally infiltrate Britain or France or Canada or Germany and then when they say no, the non-white American can be all 'Harrumph, you RACIST'? 

Is that how it works? So does this mean that only Caucasian-looking illegal aliens who are also murderers should be deported? But dark-skinned illegal aliens who murder people should be allowed to stay?

And where does the ad mention race? It's targeting illegal alien criminals. Is the media then saying all non-whites are illegal alien criminals?

So do CNN and NBC believe that US citizens should never have the right to refuse criminals infiltrating the country as long as the criminals are just dark-skinned enough?

"“When a country is evenly divided ideologically, it’s unavoidable that those who split the differences will get outsized power, because they are the ones who will ultimately decide elections. That’s why every general election that begins with ‘securing the base’ ends with the presidential candidates begging for support from centrists, independents, moderates, and the folks who really put the *asses* in masses: the Undecideds. 


Every four years after each presidential debate we are forced to listen to interviews with undecided voters who not only can’t see major differences between the political candidates (which, by that point in the campaign, means they’ve not been paying attention), but who also think the reason we have presidential debates is to give tutorials on policy minutiae: ‘I didn’t hear enough about what they would do about education.’ ‘I wanted more specifics about what [So-and-so] would do for someone like me.’ Meanwhile, back in their election headquarters the anchors nod along as if this reaction is damning of the candidates performances.”

&#x200B;

> ""One of the great things about America's democracy is we have a vigorous, sometimes bitter political contest and when it is done, historically, regardless of party, **the person who loses the election congratulates the winner, reaffirms our democracy and we move forward. That's how democracy survives because we recognize that there's something more important than any individual campaign and that is making sure that the integrity and trust in our institutions sustains itself because democracy by definition works by consent, not by force**. I have never seen in my lifetime or modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It's unprecedented. It happens to be based on no facts. Every expert regardless of political party regardless of ideology conservative or liberal who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found. That, keep in mind elections are run by state and local officials, that there are places like florida where you have a republican governor and republican appointees are going to be running and monitoring these major election sites. The notion that somehow Mr trump loses florida it's because those people you have to watch out for.. that is.. both irresponsible, and by the way, doesn't really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you want in a president. If you start whining before the game is over, **i i if if if if if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose you start blaming someone else then you don't have what it takes to be in this job**, because there are a lot of times that things don't go our way.... **or my way**. That's ok, you fight through it, you work through it. You try to accomplish your goals. But but the larger point I I I I want to emphasize here is that \*\*\***there is no serious person out there that would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections**\*\*\* in part because they are so decentralized, and the number of votes involved. **There is no evidence that that has happened in the past, or that there are instances where that will happen this time**. **And so I'd invite Mr. Trump to stop whinin' (sic) and go try to make his case to get votes. And if he got the most votes then it would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and pledge to work with him in order to make sure that... the american people benefit from an effective government.** And it would be my job to welcome Mr. Trump regardless of what he said about me or my differences with him on my opinions, and escort him over to the capital in which there will be a peaceful transfer of power. That's what Americans do. That's why America is already great. **One way of weakening America and making it less great, is if you start betraying basic American traditions that have been bipartisan.. and... uhhh... have helped to hold together this democracy now for well over two centuries**.""

">Donald Trump refused to say that he’d respect the results of this election.  That’s a direct threat to our democracy.

-Hillary Clinton

It’s legitimate when they win and “horrifying” if anyone questions it yet some of them assume it’s illegitimate when and if Republicans win.

I think a lot of people on the left have trouble believing how many people actually support the president.  To many people it’s a foregone conclusion that he’s completely evil and they have a hard time swallowing the idea that so many people are OK with it.

Maybe that’s just my impression of the types of voices I see on r/redacted and not representative of most Democrats.  Personally I think most people are good and that both Democrats and Republicans want what’s best for this country.  We all just have different ideas about how to get there and that’s OK. 

I consider the push/pull cycle of the two-party system as another layer of checks and balances on government.  Conservatives try to protect society from the unintended consequences and hubris of idealism that can lead to the errors of the future.

Liberals and progressives seemed focused on correcting society from the perceived errors of the past.

I like to think of it like were all riding along in a big bus called America. Liberals are stepping on the gas as hard as they can to keep us moving forward and pushing us over the big inclines.  Conservatives are in charge of the brakes so we don’t get out of control when the twists, turns and steep downhills present themselves.  I don’t really think there’s anyone steering this vehicle though.

I truly think we need each other. We need to listen to each other.

If you think the highest good the Government can perform is the preservation of individual liberty, then the Conservatives are your best bet for the future you want.

&#x200B;

If you want to preserve individual liberty?  No, the progressives want to go backwards.  Socialism, with it's fetish for 'the rule of experts' is a re-branding of feudalism with 'rule of intellectual right' vs 'divine right'.  There are plenty of examples of how socialism will fail and lead to authoritarianism.  Expert also seems to be equated with perfectly moral.  Again no.  Humans are going to be humans, as such, it's best to limit the excesses to which any politician or person given power can go.

Judging by many of the headlines the last two years it’s clear that they’d rather just try to tell us *what to think* over and over and over.  I think a lot of people don’t have any resistance to that type of onslaught in their mind so they become NPC’s.

I think academia works the same way. They just keep repeating the same shit year after year to these college students until they simply submit and accept that this is just *the way it is* because that’s what the authorities told them and give up on the idea of trying to maintain an independent Spartan opinion.  

They’re so afraid to be wrong that they don’t allow themselves to think anymore.",Analbox,e942kgu,The_Donald
"Ok :)  When i was reading I (obviously) had a few issues with where your analogy went.  

Totally agree no the states rights thing!  If progressives were content with just keeping their policies in their states then I'd be happy to let CA, IL, etc have their little socialist labs.  Though I'd also be happier if the people that voted that stuff in didn't flee to other states to escape the results that those policies could be predicted to create and then vote for the same shit in their  new home.

If I didn't have some concerns about what a split would lead to (China basically getting huge chunks of CA because we know when the newly independent country of CA goes to far into the money hole they are going to start selling land and everything else to China), I'd be happier with the idea of a split.  If for nothing else the ability to relax and not dread looking at the news headlines to see what new insanity the Progs are cooking up to inflict on all of us today!

Progressive policies tend to ignore the realities of human nature and the entire discipline of economics.  Also, since they either use science as a club or define actual scientific information as 'racist/sexist' it's again not surprising that their policies would create problems.",TedEGlock,e944vyz,The_Donald

"Hah!  It’s already hard to buy house in my city without cash because Chinese investors are so aggressive and well-funded.  They rent them out and sit back in China collecting checks.

And yeah of course natural law and a fixed mindset about human nature is blasphemy to the people on the left.  Many people are desperate to believe that we are all a blank slate.  They believed that our current society and culture are the central impediment to our ascendancy as a species and that removing all tradition is the only way that we could be equal.  In my opinion that mindset is basically just “Let’s destroy society to fix it.”  The problem is they’re blind to what is working already and think everything needs to be scrapped.

Tradition sometimes gets things wrong but I believe that’s the exception by a large margin.  It takes centuries to develop a tradition and it’s almost always kept around for it’s function.  It’s hard to argue with what has worked in the past to keep a society functioning well but there’s so many hysterical people that think we’re on the edge of a cliff at all times.

However, the change needs to actually make sense and not just because screaming children, with no idea of how the world actually works or have any experience with the rest of the world, want it.  There is a vast degree of experience and learning between 20 and 40+.

Couldn't agree more! Some things become tradition exactly because they worked.  It doesn't mean they shouldn't be re-evaulated from time to time, but throwing the whole thing out?  No.  Telling those people that have done the 'right things' and worked their asses off to get where they are that they need to give it to a bunch of whiny little brats?  Oh hell no!

The 'Curation' that has been going on (At least based on Gab's posts about what they have been removing) have been related to threats. [18 USC 875](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/875) explicitly outlines threats over interstate (i.e. internet) as a federal crime. 

I could be **totally** wrong on this, but I believe that a provider in this case has to remove offending material (if reported), similar to a trademark infringement and/or DMCA request. 

But, I'm having a hard time finding case law to back my words up. The closest I could find was *Delfino v. Agilent Technologies* but that was an upholding of the CDA against a State Tort and not a question of federal law.

It's also possible that it's a question that neither Epik nor Gab want to have answered right now; If there *is* no case law, it would likely be an expensive legal battle that they may not want (or be able to) be drawn into at this time. ",Michipede83,e94i4m9,The_Donald

---------------------
**NEVER, EVER VOTE FOR A MUSLIM CANDIDATE.**

This is how it started in Europe and they are trying to do the same here. 

In the U.S. right now:

* Muslims want to *normalize* themselves as candidates, so it won't seem unusual to see their names on ballots.

* They can be stopped by **outing them for what they are and what they represent.**

* EVERY candidate, Muslim or not, must be PUBLICLY confronted and asked where they stand on Sharia law.

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia, which abolishes the first amendment and freedom of speech?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia, which abolishes equal justice under the law?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia law, which allows wife-beating?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Mohammed's advise to use deception when dealing with non-Muslims? Yes or no?""

* ""What is the highest law in the United States? Is it *your* Sharia or *our* Constitution?""

*Hang Sharia and Mohammed around the neck of EACH and EVERY Muslim candidate.* Make Sharia a constant political issue.


Yes, the Muslims will lie. Doesn't matter because **the goal is to educate every voter who is watching and listening.**

**WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE MUST NEVER HAPPEN HERE.**

"Sharia is not something separate from Islam. Sharia **is** Islam. Sharia is the Koran and the ahadith and the sira compiled and codified. A Muslim can no more reject Sharia than he can the Koran and the sunna:

""And we have sent down upon you, the book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the book and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what allah has sent down and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you we prescribed a law *(shir'atan)* and a method."" Koran 5:48

The word ""sharia"" isn't the Koran AFAIK, it's derived from *shir'ah.*

Muslims often say one thing around non-Muslims and something entirely different when they're around other Muslims. They know this pacifies the *dhimmis.* He got away with telling you he ""rejects Sharia law"" because you didn't know what Sharia was (and most non-Muslims don't).

Elements of the Federal Police and the National Institute of Migration identified two Honduran citizens, members of the migrant caravan, against whom there are arrest warrants for the crimes of homicide and against health, which were returned to their country of origin.

According to the report, the Federal Police identified among the Central American immigrants who applied to enter Mexico two people with an international alert for their insurance.

The Hondurans were identified as Adín Josué ""N"", 21, linked to drug-related crimes, and Juan Carlos ""N"", 47, pointed out for his probable relationship in the murder of three people.

The operation was made possible thanks to coordination with Interpol and the Honduran National Police, under the coordination of the High Level Security Group (Ganseg), derived from intelligence work and regional coordination.

The two immigrants were secured at checkpoints in Chiapas while they were in the Siglo XXI migratory station.

""After being identified, they were transferred in a Federal Police plane under the figure of ""controlled return"", to be handed over to the Honduran authorities, in order to face their legal process in that nation,"" informed the Ministry of the Interior.

"In 2016, I started going to a gym and hired a personal trainer. As part of my new diet, I was told I needed to drastically cut back on salt intake. Since I was a kid, I loved salt; soy sauce was mana to the taste. My family joked I would be preserved like a mummy when I die due to all the salt in my body.

After a few months of training, I passed out at work. Paramedics came and drove me to the hospital. After a few tests, the doctor stated that I passed out due to a salt *deficiency*. I explained I was trying to cut back and how much I cut back. He then said that my craving for salt was my body's way of telling me I needed more salt than the average person.

"I actually voted for this because there have been several cases with high profile crimes where the case comes and goes (get dismissed) without the victims ever hearing about the outcome. This is especially true for Jeffrey Epstein's case and I think would apply to Weinstein's case as well (where Cuomo pulled strings to get it removed).


On the flip side, it clogs up the court system and slows things down. Supposedly Georgia's process will be more efficient that South Dakota's, but its hard to know the outcomes without hearing from Judges about how they think this will impact them.


Edit: These are the ""rights"" given in Georgia (probably different in other states).

 (a) For the purpose of this Paragraph, a victim shall be considered an individual against whom a crime has allegedly been perpetrated, including crimes alleged as delinquent acts. Such victims shall be accorded the utmost
dignity and respect and shall be treated fairly by the criminal justice system of this state and all agencies and departments that serve such system. When the crime is one against or involving the person of the victim or is a
felony property crime, such victim shall be afforded the following specific rights:


(1) The right upon request to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any scheduled court proceedings involving the alleged act or changes to the scheduling of such proceedings; 

(2) The right upon request to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the arrest, release, or escape of the accused; 

(3) The right not to be excluded from any scheduled court proceedings involving the alleged act;


(4) The right upon request to be heard at any scheduled court proceedings involving the release, plea, or sentencing of the accused; and


(5) The right to be informed of his or her rights. 

(b) A victim described in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph shall have the right to assert the rights  numerated in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph. The General Assembly shall provide by general law the process whereby such victim may assert the rights provided by subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph by motion within the same criminal or delinquency proceeding giving rise to such rights. At the hearing on such motion, such victim may be represented by an attorney, but neither the state nor any of its political subdivisions shall be obligated to appoint an attorney to represent him or her. The General Assembly shall provide by general law the process whereby a family member, guardian, or legal custodian of a victim when he or she is a minor, legally incapacitated, or deceased may assert the rights of such victim

(c) This Paragraph shall not:


(1) Create any cause of action against the State of Georgia ; any political subdivision of the State of Georgia; any officer, employee, or agent of the State of Georgia or of any of its political subdivisions; or any officer or employee of the court; 

(2) Confer upon any victim the right to: (A) Appeal any decision made in a criminal or delinquency proceeding; (B) Challenge any verdict or sentence  entered in a criminal or delinquency proceeding; or (C) Standing to participate as a party in a criminal or delinquency proceeding other than to file a
motion as provided in subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph; 

(3) Restrict the authority of the General Assembly, by general law, to further define or
expand upon the rights provided in this Paragraph or to regulate the reasonable exercise thereof; or 

(4) Restrict the inherent authority of the courts to maintain order in the courtroom. ",meteorknife,e9601s0,The_Donald

3. Andrew Gillum is **not** the current Governor of Florida, so Trump's statements as to how Florida would fare under Governor Andrew Gillum have no basis in fact. Rated: Pants-on-Fire!!

4. Trump's tweet implies that Florida is currently crime-free. Rated: Pants-on-Fire!!

5. Trump's tweet suggest that a Governor Gillum has *any* power to raise taxes on Floridians. Although the Governor can sign or veto tax bills passed by the legislature, the Governor *obviously* cannot pass legislation on his or her own. Rated: Pants-on-Super-Fire!!

6. Trump states that Ron DeSantis would be a ""great Governor"" despite the fact that he simply has *no way* of knowing the future. Rated: Pants-on-Super-Duper-Fire!!!!!

7. Trump implies that Andrew Gillum would do the ""same job"" as Florida Governor as Gillum performed as Tallahassee Mayor. This is an obvious lie, as these are two completely different roles, and cannot be held by the same person (under the Constitution).

The Founders knew to give more protections to the defense. But now, criminal defenders are underpaid and overworked to the point that they can't give a proper defense. It's already making it's way to the Supreme Court that criminal public defenders have it so bad that their defense cannot be called to be up to Constitutional standards.

Hmm well : NYT, HuffPost and WP all support the idea of men being silent with women ruling over them. 

Feminist rhetoric has escalated to near murderous ideas. Their slogan is taken from a male genocide essay. 

They published both an edited version of Mein Kampf and the ""Progressive Stack"" essay which detailed chaining white men to the floor because privilege in a feminist journal and said they showed too much care for the privileged people.

That's just a single group from the left.

This was a guy who, before *Roger & Me*, had so little in common with the coastal liberals at *Mother Jones*, he ended up leaving his editorial position there (he was there just long enough to get Ben Hamper a spot on the front cover).

He's always been kind of a blowhard, even back in his *Michigan/Flint Voice* days, but at least back then he championed blue collar causes.

"all the dams that were built from the 1930s to the 1970s that were hoover-dam sized is what led to the bullshit EPA and red tape we have now. during those decades all presidents and congresses supported constructing dams all over the country. ended up flooding a lot of towns and villages and destroying native american artifacts and filling up canyons and threatening 'muh endangered animals'. i still support it due to it providing fresh water to drink and electricity and most importantly FLOOD CONTROL.

would shock all of us to get even a single one of those dams approved in the 1980s-to-now EPA nanny state era.

incredibly in 2016 obama signed off on extending the glen canyon dam (fourth  tallest dam in america) by 20 years. libtards want it to be destroyed because 'muh endangered animals'.

"Just to step in here and explain why we don't have compulsory voting in the USA. Not so much to you, but to anyone in general reading this.

In America, voting is a right that every adult citizen has here in this nation. (There are some exceptions but it's true in general) Rights are not things forced on you, then they would be responsibilities. A person may choose to ignore this right as that is what makes it theirs. 

If you want to participate in the democratic process to select representatives for government you can, but if you want to not do that you can as well. Similarly you can choose to either buy a gun or not buy a gun. Gun ownership is a right but not required. 

Compulsory voting seems like a fine idea at first as you have a much higher % of the population that are interested in politics and governance, at least that's the theory. But then voting is not something you, a citizen, owns. It's a required task forced upon you by the government. 

And if you don't own the right, then it follows that the right is just a loaned privilege and could be taken away later, if the need is great. But here in the US, the right to vote is something the government cannot take away or even think about doing that, because they don't own it. Also our federal government doesn't even run voting, our states do. 

Voting is a local affair and each state can decide how it wants to vote. In theory a given state could require compulsory voting but unless there is a constitutional amendment the federal government never could, because they don't own voting. They are simply told what the results are as power flows from the people through the constitution to the government and not the other way around.

It may sound like a small distinction since, in the end, people vote and government changes in both systems but in the Australian system government engagement is much higher. However, in America, when turnout is high (as I suspect will be the case Tuesday), it will because Americans choose to have their voice heard since they have the freedom to do that.

Also those that choose not to vote are simply saying they trust their neighbors to make the right choice. Be it be fellow citizens of the state, congressional district, county, city, or neighborhood home owners association. A non vote is letting the majority of your neighbors decided which is a perfectly valid choice in my opinion.",still-at-work,e93l12p,The_Donald

EDIT: The above Section 3 definition is accurate with respect to the attempted DC law, but 4 USC §5 essentially says that civilians only need to listen to the §1 and §2 definitions of ""flag,"" which is to say actual, full US flags, instead of items that feature its likeness or are patterned after it.",RMS_Gigantic,e93k95j,The_Donald

>The following codification of existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America is established for the use of such civilians or civilian groups or organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations promulgated by one or more executive departments of the Government of the United States. **The flag of the United States for the purpose of this chapter shall be defined according to sections 1 and 2 of this title and Executive Order 10834 issued pursuant thereto.**

4 USC §1 and §2, and Executive Order 10834 all refer exclusively to the full US flag, not things patterned after it or recognizable as it as with the Section 3 definition I've been posting elsewhere in this tread.

"Thus is the nature of ""facts over feelings"": The accurate answer isn't always going to be the one you like. Justice Gorsuch said something to that effect about judges ruling about laws and the Constitution, but the same holds true for showing the greatest amount of respect for our flag: American flag capes look badass, but under Flag Code it's actually a misuse of the flag in multiple ways.",RMS_Gigantic,e94fgda,The_Donald
"Eh, I could go either way. On the one hand, our strict treatment and definition of what's respectful or not has made a lot of the rest of the world see us as prudish with our flag (for example, writing on or wearing it is seen as disrespectful, and audiences are expected to be silent during the National Anthem, unlike with most European flag codes by the looks of it).

On the other hand, it can be argued that the rest of the world doesn't treat their flags with *enough* respect, and/or that the US has more to lose if it starts down any kind of slippery slope of beginning to loosen up Flag Code. The president apparently has the authority to change Flag Code, but good luck being the president who goes down as making formerly disrespectful acts against the American flag permissible! The flag in US culture is the purely apolitical thing that every American can (theoretically) rally around as a unifying force, regardless of, say, the particular politics of the head of state, and regardless of any individual's background. Hell, it's an *international* rallying cry in a lot of ways!

Our more stringent flag code also lets us get away with things that most nations' flags don't, including refusing to dip the flag to any head of state, or other person or thing, including the president of the flag's own country.

So really, I can understand either argument, though I have to admit our generally strict adherence to a stringent flag code lets us do some fun things when in the presence of foreign flags.",RMS_Gigantic,e9508bq,The_Donald

"I believe you may have an unusual interpretation of this situation. 

Amendments 15, 19, and 26 of the constitution clearly establish voting as a legal right.  Not a “natural right,” but still a right.  You seem to be conflating natural rights with legal rights.  

Like many rights it has limitations.   For example states can constitutionally restrict this right for convicted felons.  

Violent felons and the severely mentally ill often are not allowed to purchase handguns.  We have a right to bear arms but it gets restricted if you harm society.  Some states have interpreted a similar standard to voting rights and restrict felons from voting.  

A drivers license, or a license to practice dentistry are examples of a privileges.  You are not guaranteed it by the constitution and it is left to local states to decide who gets it and make their own rules.

There are 3 amendments to the constitution as wells as laws such as the voting rights act that secure our legal right to vote.

">From what I heard Blizzcon said they had an announcement but it was not BIG

Thats not entirely true.  Before Blizzcon, Blizzard tried to hype sales by indicating they had something big to announce for Diablo fans.  Then like 2 days beforehand (after the Blizzcon tickets were sold) they tried walking it back some.  People weren't exactly expecting D4 at that point, but were expecting something for PC since, to this point, Diablo has been primarily a PC dominated game.  Then, at Blizzcon, the Diablo mobile game was revealed as the opening finale which is usually reserved for really big reveals.  So they revealed a mobile based re-skin developed by a Chinese company to a bunch of thirsty PC gamers as the big reveal.  

Once the disappointment from the initial shock had died down somewhat, a person asked if the game was going to be made available for PC (again, a somewhat normal question given the overwhelmingly PC dominated crowd) and their response was, I shit you not,:

She doesn't have the swagger needed. as an example, matt smith's first episode he has that amazing final scene with the flying-eyeball-snowflake thing with the images of previous doctors flashing as he delivers a monologe that says i'm a bad ass mother fucker, in case you didn't know.

Correct me if I'm wrong, and i'm a Christian so don't take this the wrong way, but this shit reminds me of like the type of religious person that tries to protect their children from EVERYTHING because everything is 'the devil'. Like the mom from the Waterboy with Sandler.

Children should be exposed to controversial things like this WHEN DONE RIGHT.

That word should be brought up, probably. Ya think? Especially if you, I dunno, want your students to know why that word is a problem to so many people.

I'm really curious how the book deal is going to go. (Obviously, it will be ghost-written) but... if she doesn't remember anything, is it going to be a really short book? I can see how she might get some pages out of talking about her experience testifying, and/or the days leading up to it. (Although... there are things she may **not** want to talk about, because her ""story"" about ""fear of flying"" is BS along with pretty much anything else she says.)

After bush jr. Fucked up this country I voted for Obama.  Only to realize that the hope and change Obama promised was a lie.  The bailout of the banks really pissed me off.  I voted for Trump because I believed he would keep his promises and he has.  The economy is doing great and he says he will cut taxes for the middle class.  He wiped out Isis and brought peace to the Korean peninsula. He is tough on crime awhile also offering funding to programs that treat drug addiction.

"Well, with any form of communication, you analyze the audience, and you analyze the way to reach that audience.

When posting on reddit, the vast majority of the time you're not really communicating with the person you click ""reply"" to, you're communicating with those who come afterwards to read it.

With that in mind, if you determine that the person you're responding to is not going to be persuaded under any circumstances, you're free to respond directly to the readers who come after. Of course, this is not the only method - you can try to respond and persuade the parent, but it's time consuming and invariably you end up with an audience of one person.

And playing to the broader audience is a lot more fun - you can use tools like sarcasm and biting wit to draw out the flaws in the parent post by taking their argument to a logical end (or at least to the next step.) This usually angers the audience and prompts them to defend why they believe your response does not follow - but if you've done it correctly, they will realize that the (usually circular) path the parent post has put them on leads back to a flawed premise, and at that point you've given them the tools necessary to see through the lie for themselves. It's always more effective when someone discovers the truth themselves than when they are explicitly shown the truth.

"That's one answer but the reality is that the US can't take all migrants. There are over 7 billion people on the planet and the majority would probably like to move to the US. Do we want the US to have 1 billion in population? 2 billion? I grew up when the US had half the population it does now. It was great. Now, traffic has gotten much worse, the National Parks are overcrowded, housing/medical care/college are extremely high. Social capital has degraded a lot in many places and people are constantly anxious. Read Robert Putnam's study regarding diversity. Having massive population growth is a fool's errand and the Ponzi scheme of Social Security needs to be private accounts like Chile has.

The vast majority of these Latin American migrants are welfare dependent. Due to their cultural traits, they are forming a large underclass in the US. They have high dropout rates, high illegitimacy rates, high welfare use, high crime rates although not as bad as blacks. In California, hispanics commit 50% of homicides and rapes. California used to have the best K-12 school system, now it's at the bottom, not because of money issues, but because of changing demographics. Studies have proven that hispanic immigrants' children do a little better than  their parents but, by the next generation, they use more welfare. We have our own example of hispanic run America, it's called Puerto Rico. A place that, due to its corruption and high crime rate, was called Welfare Island by the Economist.

Excessive welfare use is why the majority of developed countries have a merit based immigration system. You can't have a sustainable welfare system and open borders. Immigrants need to be able to pay for themselves and their dependents. 51% of immigrant headed households in the US use some form of welfare compared to 30% of native born households. This shows we are letting in too many takers. 

So the short answer of they should get in line, too, is wrong. The answer is that we have enough unskilled 3rd world welfare parasites and we don't need more. There is NO line for them. It's also far cheaper to help them in their own countries. The countries they come from have plenty of wealthy kleptocrats that should be ""persuaded"" to share the wealth and invest in education and infrastructure. Why the elites in the West ignore this and promote 3rd world immigration is treasonous.",Acid_Howl,e93onvg,The_Donald

"Here's what Muslims *really* think of Jews: 

**""Allah's curse be on the Jews and the Christians.""** (Sahih Bukhari 59:727) 

Mohammed said this on his death bed. It was one of the last things that he ever said. Imagine being so consumed by your hated of Jews and Christians that it's the one thing your mind obsesses about when your own death is imminent.

**TL;DR:** Mohammed tried to get the Jews of Medina to join his cult, they refused, so he robbed, murdered, and/or enslaved them. *Muslims are told today to do whatever Mohammed did.*

---------------------------------
Mohammed had a problem with Jews from the start. He was exiled from Mecca and wound up in Medina in the year 622. He and his cult -- still small and in a position of relative weakness -- were then dependent on the good graces of the three Jewish tribes who already lived there. 

At first Mohammed tried to tell the Jews he was their messiah/Christ. The Jews didn't fall for that, especially since Mohammed got the Torah totally wrong. He presented it as a series of fairy tales with the same redundant moral: believe Mohammed's claims about himself or be annihilated. 

The Jews then challenged him to perform some miracles as past prophets had. Mohammed couldn't. So he instead declared the Jews to be heretics and accused them of ""hiding"" the Torah verses that declared Mohammed was their messiah. 

During this time Mohammed had been raiding merchant caravans. He stole goods and murdered anyone who dared to defend them (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 424-425). As soon as his cult had sufficient wealth and power to do so, Mohammed sent an army against the Jewish communities which had welcomed him just two years earlier. 

The first Jewish tribe he went after, the Qaynuqa, surrendered without a fight. Mohammed intended to slaughter the entire tribe but was talked out of it by his one of his men who was horrified by this plan. Instead, Mohammed ran them out and stole all of their wealth and their land. 

He ran out the second Jewish tribe, the Banu Nadir, less than a year later. The demon-god allah then ""revealed"" to Mohammed that he was to keep all of their land and wealth for himself, personally... which he did, operating with the utter impunity of a cult leader.

The third Jewish tribe was the Banu Qurayza. Mohammed said an ""angel"" (seen only by himself, of course) ordered him to attack the tribe. Like the others, the Qurayza were peaceful farmers and tradesmen. They also surrendered without a fight. 

Mohammed saw no reason to repress his genocidal urges any longer. He had the Qurayza men and boys rounded up and bound with rope. Mohammed's men dug trenches and beheaded the Qurayza in batches. There was no point in trying to determine whether or not they were actually combatants because there were none. *There had been no combat.* 

Some 800 surrendered men and boys (and at least one woman) were slaughtered in the bloodbath (Ibn Kathir, v.3 p.170; Bukhari 58:148). Mohammed personally took part in the killing. (Koran 33:26)

One poor Qurayza woman literally went insane seeing her family butchered right in front of her. The murderers apparently found her maniacal laughter annoying and beheaded her as well. (Abu Dawud 2665)

The remaining women and children were forced into slavery. Mohammed kept some rape slaves for himself, including a pretty young Jewish girl (freshly ""widowed"" and thus available to him for servitude as a rape slave; Ishaq/Hisham 693), gave some to his soldiers, and sold off others for weapons and horses. (Ishaq 693, Ibn Kathir v.3 p.172) 

Mohammed insisted his demon-god ""allah"" told him to do this to the Qurayza men, women and children. (Bukhari 58:148)

**Remember: Muslims are told Mohammed was the perfect man and they are to emulate him in every way.**

* Wives can be beaten. Koran 4:34, Ishaq 969, Muslim 4:2127, Abu Dawud 2141 and 2142
* Wives have to stop what they're doing whenever their husbands demand sex, and give it to them. Jami at-Tirmidhi 1160
* Wives cannot refuse sex. Sunan Ibn Majah 1853
* Raping your wife is allowed. Koran 2:223
* Wives can be raped in any position. Sunan Abu Dawud 2159
* Wives should stay in abusive marriages. Bukhari 72:715
* The most important thing a woman brings to marriage is unrestricted access to her vagina. Sahih Bukhari 62:81 

* The Koran devotes MORE verses to making sure that Muslim men know they can keep women as rape slaves (four) than it does to telling them to pray five times a day (zero).

* An imam in South Carolina stated that [a husband is the ""owner"" and ""ruler"" of a wife who must obey him as his ""prisoner.""](http://archive.is/wQwW4) 

* Eleven of the 12 countries with the [highest rate of discrimination against women are Muslim-majority countries.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NXtIUv5i2w)

"Exactly. If money were lent free of charge, then it would obviously not be lent at all, since there is no incentive for the lender to take the risk. Sharia does not work in the real world of capital and trade. Therefore, Islamic finance actually involves interest but calls it something else: **murabaha.**  

Murabaha means inflating the purchase price to assure that the lender gets a return on their investment. It's not called ""interest"" but the effect is the same.

For example, you take out a $100,000 mortgage on a house. At 5% interest, your payment is $537/mo for 360 months. Total cost = $193,000.   

Under Sharia the lender technically doesn't charge interest *but the purchase amount is figured as $193,000.*  Total cost = $193,000. 

Same same. Oh -- except that under Sharia your ability to pay down early or realize equity is massively complicated, meaning that the lender enjoys the arrangement a lot more than you do!

Sarsour knows that there is no real financial benefit to Sharia. She is hoping her gullible audience does not. She blatantly misleads them into thinking that they will not pay to borrow money under Sharia, when it simply isn't true.   

This is an example of **taqiyya,** the Islamic principle of deception for the advancement of Islam. In this case, the consequences are sort of benign once the truth is discovered. The same cannot be said of the fate of religious minorities, atheists, women, and homosexuals, who all suffer greatly under Islamic law.

You'll find that most Jews live in parts of the country that live in parts of the country that tend to be Democrat and vote like their neighbors do. Jews tend to live in urban areas, specifically in order, NY, LA, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, etc. It would be almost weird if they didn't vote majority Dem with those numbers. As it is, it's about 70/30. 

You'll also find that the Jews that ended up emigrating from Russia to the US tend to be republicans, same with religious Jews.

As far as why Jews in Russia supported Communism, I can give you a list of good reasons as to why they often supported a bad movement, but I don't know if you were really asking for all of this.

"Our military costs a LOT. It does. But that doesn’t mean it’s *big*. People confuse this all the time. Spending and combat power are not one and the same. 

China can probably field 50 soldiers for the cost of 1 Army Ranger. It would be cool if 1 Army Ranger could kill 50 Chinese soldiers, but that’s simply not true. So we need to spend a lot more to make sure that we can field 30-50 Rangers (or better yet, Marines) when the time comes. 

Our military provides service members with housing, food, healthcare, retirement options, and competitive pay compared to the civilian sector. China uses conscription. A very large portion of our DoD budget goes towards pay and benefits. I believe it’s about a third. 

So anyone who ever makes the argument that we are overpowered because of what we spend has a fundamental misunderstanding of how our military spends money versus how countries like China or North Korea spend their money. 

Additionally, people who make this argument have no clue about currency exchange rates. If you spend $2 on a cheeseburger, you’ve already spent an entire week’s of wages for a Chinese person. For the cost of 1 American M-16, you can buy 30 AK-47’s in the streets of Somalia. So again, the “we spend more” argument is ludicrous when values of currency is ignored. If you spend more on 1 meal than a Chinese person earns in a month, does that mean you’re eating 90 times the food? ",Maj-Janson,e9654rg,The_Donald

"The threshold and burden is very low for these kinds of orders, which is the problem. You already have to show a propensity of evidence or probalble cause, to get a restraining or harrassment order (51 %). This would already make the person subject to the order prohibited from possessing a firearm.
These red flag laws, which were a knee jerk reaction and quick push for a gun grab, have an even lower threshold and burden, and can be filed by uninvolved third parties, based on heresay, and without any chance of a prior hearing or presentation of a defense.

It is possible/probable that in some cases, a law abiding, mentally stable person, who has broken no law, and been not found to by violent or a threat, and had no notice or chance to contest, could be met at the door by police, demanding that he immediately relinquish a constitutional right, means of protection, and valuable personal property.

"I found this comment the other day. The subject was France then this guy began discussing Europe in general. It blew my mind and I'm already well aware of mass migration and Islamization. Longer read but worth it-

""Their desperation comes from their knowledge that the euro is soon going the way of the dodo and Trumps election has speed up the process to the point they cant contain it

Raising rates will first destroy the Italian financial world and subsequent most of the big euro banks, at this point poverty will be on the streets and the gibs to moderately placate the invaders will dry up

fun times ahead

further to the collection of Americans that have never been to Europe a few observations

the police and armies of almost all countries are completely castrated, the current governments do not possess the means to pacify even one big city in their respective countries, they rely solely on projection of strength, the first riots where the police are beaten back will result in total anarchy as people realize they can get away with anything, their own plans count on almost total desertion amongst general police departments after 1 week of sustained unrest

you are not going to abandon your family to guard the palaces of the rich when they don't even pay you anymore

there is no possible chance of balkanisation, the invaders are clustered in ghettos in large cities and are totally unproductive living on government assistance, they cant hold any territory. further all the invaders are also complete numales who live in heated government paid for apartments who have no idea of surviving without sleeping in their own beds, burning some defenseless cars for a few hours does not a rambo make

maybe the caliphate of Marseille will rise for a few months but the importance of the harbour means that it will be shelled into subsmission

also when the troubles begin there will be no effective interventions american, russian or EU

the logistic problems of keeping the large cities supplied are not to be fixed, no army could secure that large a population and feed it

also only one boomer has to be capture by nationalist forces to permanently prevent any foreign intervention, MAD does not work against a rebellion without any clear cities to bomb.""",GLOMPFFH_IS_FINISHED,e93sjg8,The_Donald

"It's not that they aren't bright. Europeans are quite intelligent and ""educated"" (in what they are allowed to know) and good and bright actually.  Reality is that WE did this to a large extent. We blanketed Europe in propaganda of collective guilting and shaming and degradation of whites and installed puppet governments and pushed what we thought was a moderate form of socialism ... aka, democratic socialism ... that we could control after WWII.  And all that collective guilting and shaming and empowerment of communism and socialism following WWII even allowed it to fester in the USA, which resulted in the 60s, fueled by the soviets throwing propaganda gasoline on the fire at the same time. 

Even up until recently and even today still to a lesser degree, Germany and Germans in particular have been relentlessly guilted and psychologically berated several generations after WWII ... which was a DICTATORSHIP ... that you didn't just somehow stand up and say ... I really don't want to take part in this ... because you would be dead; and that has caused MASSIVE psychosis and mental derangements in all of Europe, but mostly Germany's relationship to their identity and culture. 

It's really nothing different than a (mostly) woman that is/was in an abusive relationship where here abuser not only fucked with her mind and made her feel like shit and degraded her and made her feel like everything is her fault and all of the problems were because she didn't try hard enough and he beats her only because he loves her ... that level of fucked up ... and then she tries to leave and everyone around her is just constantly berating her for how damaged she is and how low self-esteem she has and how fucked up she is after years of abuse. It would fuck her up, just the same way that Germans and Europeans are fucked up. 

Then, on top of that, layer on that we have been babying Europe for at least 60 years now by taking care of their security and protecting the international trade routes and letting them live off of us with generous trade deals meant to get them back on their feet; so now, so long after having lived in that fantasy world we created and enabled for them, they are like delicate little flowers that don't know how to protect themselves and don't even know how to reproduce anymore. 

It's unfortunate, but our ""help"" that all the liberals pushed, has really done nothing but made Europe weak and naive and feeble minded. They have been propagandized for 60+ years that ""we are all the same"" there is obviously no difference between Africans and whites once you look past reality (which even we now suffer from) ...... so of course they thrown open the gates to those people who are of course exactly the same as they are in temperament, civility, courtesy, and mindset.

"I love how they think worshipping a coke head Baldwin is taking the high road.... well, shit, they aren’t fully wrong about the high part. Anyone at the top of those main stations is purely a talking head. They become the words on the page because the page is their life., without the page, and the lights, and the gossip, they are useless. They went full retard in order to keep their jobs, steady line of drugs, money, houses, jets, free shit, and whatever else money buys. 

It’s honestly sad watching celebrities try and live and act like they are on our level or even think we’re dumb enough to listen to their advice as they fly around in private jets destroying the planet or cruising in their yachts. They literally do more harm through their profession and reading what’s on the page, making society react emotionally to fiction, than they do good in their free time with their “reach” (rule following page reading skills which lead to more people hearing what you, or should we say, the page has to declare) 

Hell even in the profession of movie making, they are known as the “talent” one set and anyone else might as well be, not talented. So even when they work, they are on a level above their co-workers without even stepping foot on or around set. When a celebrity talks about equality, they may as well be shitting out of their mouths. I love my neighbors and I don’t need a page to tell me I don’t.

In a way this goes back to Roosevelt's era, as the State Department acceded to Mao rather than giving adequate support to Sun Yat Sen and the Nationalists.  
  
We can't really blame either party here though.  
Yes, China was lost in 1949 during the Truman administration. But ... Nixon and Kissenger normalized relations, Clinton pushed their inclusion in the WTO, the Bushes overlooked illegal trade policy and currency manipulation, etc.  
  
Until Trump, cucking to China has been a feature of the bipartisan establishment.  
  
If you think about it, shipping jobs to China more or less broke the American middle class.  
  
The rabble are easy to control, and the elites *do* the controlling. It's the middle class which stands as a threat to the establishment. Thus has it ever been since there was a middle class - that's who broke the English Monarchy, that's who caused the French revolution (I know, but still), that's who broke America's earlier elite (the Robber Baron capitalists), that's who unionized. The middle class is the enemy of our elite rulers.  
  
Using college to turn middle class children against their parents will only work as long as nobody notices the layers of bullshit required to sustain such a policy. This is why the internet requires censorship - it is the means by which the middle class can recover its power.",User-31f64a4e,e94cvvt,The_Donald

">The subreddit’s malicious playfulness is one of its most salient features. It sometimes seems The_Donald’s most avid shitposters are primarily playing “Trigger the Libs.” I’ve found it useful to think of The_Donald as an alternate-reality video game that exists in a liminal space between the web and the real world. Its users construct their own characters and mash the keyboard to complete a series of missions and defeat an endless series of villains—Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama—while advancing toward the end goal of rescuing the princess, Donald Trump, held hostage by the “deep state.” Trump’s speeches, rallies, and tweets function as cut scenes that ground the action, explain the plot, and establish new quests for players to complete. Users accumulate points through upvotes, Reddit gold, and other metrics. It’s a more evil Jumanji.

"Reminder: 

During Obama's campaigns, the media gushed over this as Obama taking **bold new steps** in modern electioneering; tapping into the youth vote and bypassing 19th century canvassing by taking advantage of hip, new, ""transformative, game-changing""  social media technologies that ""leveraged the power of friendship"".

https://i.imgur.com/yoUpULQ.jpg

http://archive.is/grlwo

>The significance of the fusion of Facebook and voter file data is hard to overemphasise. ""This is the Moneyball moment for politics,"" says Sam Graham-Felsen, Obama's chief blogger in 2008. ""If you can figure out how to leverage the power of friendship, that opens up incredible possibilities.""

>Teddy Goff, the digital director of the re-election team, told Social Media Week that as the year progresses there would be more and more ""persuasion through interaction"".

>Goff said the campaign was focused on building relationships through social media. An Obama message would be crafted so that ""not only can it be passed to your friends but to those friends that we think are most in need of passing it on to"".",weltallic,e946fj0,The_Donald

"I’m slowly working on my mom. She sees the TV and thinks “Orange Man Bad”. She’s a smart woman too. Has patents through her work type smart. 

I asked her one day “ mom, when was the last time you read anything positive about Trump in the news?” 

She said she didn’t even know. Literally couldn’t even think of a positive story. 

So I asked her “isn’t that weird mom? I mean, he’s out POTUS, unemployment is at historical lows, consumer confidence is a historical highs, the stock market is sky rocketing, and manufacturing is roaring back, but the news has nothing good to report? Does that make any sense?” 

She agreed it did seem odd, but then she said she didn’t like the way he spoke to people. That he sounded like a bully and didn’t appreciate his tone. I said “would you have a great tone if literally everything said about you by 95% of the media was mean spirited, negative, and aggressive. she said “probably not”

Then I asked her if she ever actually listened to one of his rally speeches, unedited. Not the sound bites from the news, but an actual rally from start to finish. So she could actually hear his words in the context they are spoken. She said no. 

I then challenged her to go and watch one of his speeches without editing and tell me again that she thinks “Orange Man Bad” 

That was a couple days ago. 

I am waiting to hear what she has to say about him after she watches a rally speech.

"The Democrat party is in a fight for its life.

Several years back, the news started to spread, not by the mainstream media, but through secret back channels: “what have the democrats done for us?” the people started to ask. In places and races predominantly held under democrat control. The question became a single statement, uttered by Trump, but sending shockwaves through the democrat party: “what have you got to lose?” So minorities started to red pill left and right. They started opening their eyes and abandoning the democrat party.

What was the party to do? The old tactics: call them Uncle Tom or NAZI weren’t working. They had to come up with a new scheme to stay in power. So they turned their attention to illegal immigrants. There were already so many in the country, more than we suspected. The party knew that first time immigrants almost always vote democrat. The scheme was hatched and plans were laid. Either get illegal immigrants legalized or at least get them voting without the feds being able to track them. So states like California went all in, giving illegals voting rights locally with some “ooops, looks like some may have voted nationally...sorry”, while refusing to provide any dat to the feds and fighting against anything that might give away their numbers. At the same time they worked to set up a system to get as many illegals into the country as possible. Those illegals could potentially become legal or at least start voting.

This idea will spread to over democrat controlled states and if enough start to participate, it could break the system.

This is their last ditch effort to stay relevant and win back power. Don’t let them do it. The only way to avoid this is to **vote on Tuesday and vote for Republicans**. Give Trump the resources to close the border and kick illegals out and put an end to birthright citizenship.",SomeGuysCat,e93nm3u,The_Donald
