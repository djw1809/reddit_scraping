Most of the attention was devoted to her critique of Donald Trump:

>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine what this place would be ‚Äî I can‚Äôt imagine what the country would be ‚Äî with Donald Trump as our president,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFor the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even want to contemplate that.‚Äù

Hidden away was this nugget:

>It was a credit to the eight-member court that it deadlocked only four times, she said, given the ideological divide between its liberal and conservative wings, both with four members.  
 One of the 4-4 ties, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, averted what would have been a severe blow to public unions had Justice Scalia participated. ‚ÄúThis court couldn‚Äôt have done better than it did,‚Äù Justice Ginsburg said of the deadlock. When the case was argued in January, the majority seemed prepared to overrule a 1977 precedent that allowed public unions to charge nonmembers fees to pay for collective bargaining.  
 A second deadlock, in United States v. Texas, left in place a nationwide injunction blocking Mr. Obama‚Äôs plan to spare more than four million unauthorized immigrants from deportation and allow them to work. That was unfortunate, Justice Ginsburg said, but it could have been worse.  
 ‚ÄúThink what would have happened had Justice Scalia remained with us,‚Äù she said. Instead of a single sentence announcing the tie, she suggested, a five-justice majority would have issued a precedent-setting decision dealing a lasting setback to Mr. Obama and the immigrants he had tried to protect.

When given a choice between the life of a friend and pushing forward with profoundly anti-American, anti-freedom, and anti-Constitutional policies, Ginsburg doesn‚Äôt hesitate to say, ‚ÄúThink what would have happened had Justice Scalia remained with us.‚Äù",LepricPolymath,e9amve2,The_Donald

Helus was immediately hit with multiple gunshots, Dean said. The highway patrolman cleared the perimeter and pulled Helus out, and then waited as a SWAT team and scores more officers arrived. Helus died early Thursday at a hospital.

Helus was a 29-year veteran of the force with a wife and son and planned to retire in the coming year, said the sheriff, who choked back tears several times as he talked about the sergeant who was also his longtime friend.

Let's go with the larger number. Let us further exaggerate by claiming all 1100 cases happened in a single year, and that furthermore, 99% of cases go undetected.

The precise reason that democrats had basically 0 chance to take the senate is that they had more than DOUBLE the number of seats up for re-election that republicans had.  This naturally flows to them getting FAR more senate votes in total.  I don't see why this is difficult to understand?

"The teachers are likely underpaid.  

The problem is the public education system in general.  

I don't have numbers on American kids, so I'll use stats from Israel to make my point(All sums are in NIS):  
Every kid going through K-12 education costs the state between 38~42k.  
The average salary for teachers is ~10k.  

We also have private schools, which receive no funding whatsoever from the state.  

Average annual price for a kid in a private school is 45k.

Teachers in private schools make on average 16k.  


The kids in the private schools also enjoy far better facilities than in the public schools, and end up with better life prospects over all.  

The ONLY difference between these two is that teachers in private schools aren't unionized(I think. At least most private schools keep operating during strikes).  

UNIONS are the problem.  

Why?
Because if you keep your head low, you can get tenure, and then the only way you can be fired is if you rape a kid in front of the entire class, and even then, there's a serious chance you won't be punished.  

Unions don't reward merit but seniority.  

The longer a teacher is in the system, the more they make, but the starting salary is like 7k.  

The teachers union has also blocked every single attempt at moving to a voucher system in place of the current system.

What is the voucher system?  
The state gives you a cheque for 40k to be redeemed at a school of your choice.



So long story short:  
Teachers ARE indeed underpaid.  
There is absolutely no reason why a teacher SHOULDN'T be making 100, and even 200k per year(I threw a massive number out there, but I'm one of those psychos that thinks competent teachers should be in the top 5% of wage earners. Fuck me, right?).

This. Every state gets 2 senators, whether its Wyoming, Rhode Island, or California. The House representatives are assigned based on state population. This is by intentional design by the framers, to prevent larger/populous states from overriding the interests of the smaller/sparse states. There would not be a United States if this was not in place.

"People like to have fun bashing Nate Silver, but he really is one of the best in his field. He just happens to be the name most associated with polling, and the polls were so completely wrong and completely misinterpreted in 2016.

But no one has been more accurate in interpreting polling data than Nate Silver. He got almost every single state right in past presidential elections, and was very accurate for the 2018 election.

Yes, his system predicted Hillary was likely to win in 2016... but every poll was predicting that. Most of the media thought there was a 95-99% chance of a Hillary win, but Nate Silver recognized the chance that Democrat turnout may be low and Republicans may be underrepresented in polls, and only gave her a 70% chance to win.

A Trump win seemed unlikely to many voters, including many people who voted for Trump and were happily surprised to see that he actually won. It wouldn't have been a surprise if he was expected to win by everyone. Silver was right to predict a 70% chance of a Hillary win... and a prediction like that is not a guarantee. You wouldn't board a plane with a 30% chance of crashing, even though the odds are in your favor. A roulette table has a 97% chance the ball will land on a red or black number, but you don't complain ""the odds are wrong!"" if it lands on the green 0.

"**I posted this below and I feel like this may give insight as to our problems with the amount of gun violence we're facing currently. I have a BSW in social work with a minor in abnormal psychology (the science of mental illness).** 

Back in the 1920's and 1930's we had mental health care in the form of psychiatric hospitals. Until deinstitutionalization, which came as a result of a few things. First the invention of psychiatric drugs to manage symptoms, which is reliant on the mentally ill taking them. Now with disorders like Schizophrenia they can't understand the correlation between symptom management and taking medicine. When the symptoms begin disappearing, many Schizophrenic people believe they're being cured and decide the medicine is no longer necessary. Secondly it was the focus on community centered mental health. Finally, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act moved the majority of funding from mental health, leading to the closure of what little psychiatric facilities remained. I believe in the 1980's there was only 75 psych hospitals left. **Mental illness does not automatically make a person violent, just like not every violent person is mentally ill. Please remember that, some people are just evil**

So the first issue is a lack of affordable and adequate mental health treatment. The second issue is the more lax restrictions on who can own gun and the lack of education required to obtain them. A gun education class like when you receive your drivers license would be a great step, you can't have safety without awareness.

By the time I was in high school - I was in a troop of 2- and it was basically a college prep course with lots of volunteering (I mean lots)- and of course cookies (which I sold like crazy to fellow classmates who couldn't believe I was still a girl scout who had jobs but no real bills. I did way better in hs with way less effort lol). Now- my involvement is solely commenting on GSA's fb posts. And they have changed. They have always taught about famous strong women in general - but now it's all strong political figures and specific celebrities with compatible political views.  When I was learning knots and how to start campfires - it was about being the best YOU you could be. It was about doing all sorts of fun and cool stuff and learning new things.  It wasn't really ABOUT being a girl I guess. The code wasn't about feminine energy or any bullshit- it was about being responsible and a good friend and whatnot. 

I wish girls could have the kind of girl scout troop experience my mom and I had- but I'm not sure it exists...",ChanguitaShadow,e9aucbr,The_Donald

">Scouting is dead and has been for a long time.

This is not universal.  Maybe in California this is true.  Come to Georgia.  Every Scout Troop has to be sponsored by someone.  In the South, that's a church.  Every single time.  The meetings take place on Church properties, usually gymnasiums or secondary buildings, every level of scouting has *mandatory* religion requirements for promotion, and every meeting ends with a non-denominational prayer to ""The Great Scoutmaster of All Scouts"".  Most of the pack/troop leaders are also youth ministers.

People are overreacting to all this shit about them allowing girls and changing names.  The national leadership is worried about bad press, but almost nothing they say matters to the actual troops.  The scout troops are too busy learning to be scouts and their sisters were all already participating anyway and have been for decades.  The only thing that changed is now they get uniforms and badges for doing what they were already learning to do anyway.

Inclusion is good when it's done for the right reasons, and this time it was for the right reasons.

Now if you saw this guy, you could say it wouldn't have surprised you. He is the pure definition of a soy boy. 

What I can't understand, is why is there a *need* to become a female? I understand the wanting to start over part, but there are many alternatives to that than just mutilating your body to become something you're not. 

I feel worse for his kids, because they will grow up with a father like that. Chances are, his wife will divorce him, and start new with another man. So the kids will have to grow up with a man who isn't their father, in order to fill that gap that their biological father created for his own selfish needs. 

Coincidentally, this same scenario is happening to a friend of my sister. He, at the age of 40 something, decided to transition to female. The guy is married to a woman from Singapore and has 3 children with her. When he decided he was going to transition, she left him and took the kids with her back to Singapore. So now those kids will grow up in a country they aren't familiar with because of their father wanting to be a woman.

On the other hand, the amount of soy, feminism and trannyism that has infiltrated and permeated Western gaming beggars belief. So even if you manage to get away from shitty business practices, it's still nearly impossible to make a good game without having it defiled by the SJWs, either during the development process, or afterwards. And what's worse, Western companies, being completely saturated with soy, lack the cajones to tell the SJWs to go fuck themselves, like, for example, Warhorse Studios did. No surprise, look at how many females are on Blizzard staff now. BUT MUH GAMER GURLS worked out so well for us. /s Shit, even CDPR, the ""great white hope"" of gaming, bent over, so not even Eastern Euros are safe. 

If this trajectory continues, the money to make REAL games will eventually dry up. Old gamers like myself, with disposable income, will eventually die out or quit.

"You have essentially 2 options.  British/Australian draconian firearms requirements or more lenient CCW laws.  This may seem like a false dichotomy at first but we need to look at the complex situation with shooters that lead to these 2 options.  

Making guns very, very hard to obtain will certainly lead to reduced gun violence over a long period of time (decades) but will lead to a black market for all the guns and ammo currently available and lead to a likely increase due to criminal activity.  This would unlikely be accepted by the general public and would be fought in courts furiously due to the nature of our constitution.

Allowing more lenient gun laws is an option that allows for greater threat reduction while in groups (ala herd immunity mentioned by others) but could lead to more shootings in crimes of passion or road rage.  

There are other mitigating options,  but I don't think they address mass shootings in a sufficient form to reduce the overall occurrences.  You have the expansion of national background checks to include access for private citizens, these are easy to skirt if you want a gun just like requiring private sales to be done through FFL because it's the same system.  A criminal will ignore this and get a gun however he likes, just see all the gang activity with straw purchasers.  

There's also restricting sales of ammunition, but as we see from this event - It did not stop the shooter because California has the most strict laws on handguns in the nation (no-buy list, limited ammo sales, very limited CCW issuance in certain counties, etc).  

I agree that we as a nation should do something should do something that is immediately effective in reducing gun violence because it is a tragedy,  what that something is yet I don't know.  My thought is that we as a society are to fractured and divisive, setting up perceived enemies which can be dehumanized easily and lead to a mindset that can encourage shooters.  How do we get back to civility, respect, and kindness?  People with mental instabilities are not shown kindness in this country on a regular basis.  Let's be realistic, it's not just people like that who aren't shown kindness and compassion, most people go about their day with not much regard for each other.

How do you legislate a civil society?  Or morality?  Could we start with a program that discourages shootings in the news?  Sanction organizations that use shooters for 24/7 reporting and revenue?  Studies show that the constant reporting cycle encourages more shooters who wish to be romanticized.  

Not related to mass shootings, but what if we continued to focus on lifting up poorer individuals with wages that met their most basic needs?  Advocating that here is dangerous but I think it goes a long way towards discouraging burglary.  How about regulating companies that prey on poor people like short term lending?  It creates a cycle of poverty that feeds into violence.

I think the more typical profile is that they were at one time a law abiding citizen with perhaps some history of mental illness/depression/anxiety who purchased a gun lawfully.

So the argument that if we make gun ownership more difficult for law abiding citizens we will end up with only ""the bad guys"" owning guns is misguided in my opinion.  These mass shootings aren't really being perpetrated by ""the bad guys"", but by seemingly normal citizens who have either fallen into mental illness or depression or something of that sort.  That's what makes this situation so scary.  These people may have been ""good guys"" at one time or another.

Just as a thought experiment, imagine what American society would be like if any individual over the age of 18, without exception, were allowed to drive a car or truck without any sort of licensing requirement.

"Gotcha that is a little more clear cut. I would compare guns to drugs. Are most drug users career criminals or are they people who want to get their hands on a product and find a way to make it happen? I think also your scenario lays out how impossible the situation is. If they are a normal citizen and acquire their license and firearm before they become mentally ill how did that do anything to stop a mass shooting? I personally believe that freedom and the ability for self defense outweighs the potential for mass shootings, especially since number wise they are almost nothing on our national gun violence rate. The vast majority of which are suicide with a firearm and gang violence.

I think a much better deterrent to mass shootings would be that shooters understood that anywhere they went there was a great threat of people shooting back because of a higher concealed carry populace. The Batman movie theater shooter stated that he chose that particular theater for his shooting, when there were 3 closer to his house, was that those theaters allowed concealed carry in their establishments. He purposefully avoided any chance of being fired upon until police arrived so that he wouldnt be stopped after only firing a handful of times. 

As for the licensing requirement I am personally against that as well. We have a Constitutional right to self defense, not to drive. I also dont want to give the government anymore power in stripping citizens of their right to defend themselves. Some states, like the one I unfortunately live in due to the military, have extreme requirements to receive a concealed carry license and right up the road Baltimore is one of the deadliest cities in America.

"You have a nice style, and have a lot of potential. 

I‚Äôd suggest you do some eye studies. Get a photo of Trump, and focus on duplicating and capturing the impression of the eyes. It doesn‚Äôt have to be photorealistic, art like this can be really powerful because it triggers something in our brains to make a solid association to the subject.  

A drawing of the president may actually (technically) look nothing like Trump, but, yet the viewer immediately knows who it is.  Yes cues like the red tie and black suit help, but it‚Äôs often the eyes and key facial features that make that connection. 

Or if you‚Äôre going for more cartoonish, then exaggerated features (caricature) of the subject (hair, suit/tie, facial stricture) that does it, though with less of an emotional reaction.

"Well it demands on what you call a win and the impact it has on the political spectrum. I would say the Republicans won to a certain extent but I don't think any faction got dealt a death blow.

&#x200B;

The Progressive:  

Pro's-Have Bernie Sanders if you throw out the policy aspects he is very good at getting voters motivated and turn out. He is the only candidate on the left that has name recognition and isn't widely hated.

Con's- They have no power and lost a lot of elections outside of the democratic stronghold states. Their policies fail with the typical American voter. They also don't hold any power without there party.

&#x200B;

The corporate democrats/neo liberal:

Pro's- They still  are able to get funds and have a fast network of celebrities. The biggest thing is holding the power and being able to leverage said power against the progressives. Also they performed better then the progressive's.

Con's- The extreme is running amok as they refuse to deal with them and already rule through horrible tactics that will fracture them further. They haven't learned from 2016 yet and the results showed how inept they are as those races shouldn't have been close in some of those district strongholds.

&#x200B;

Independent's:

Pro's - People being driven to either extreme has really forced the common sense middle people to stick together and they decide who wins at the end of the day.

Con's - No real dominant power to unite the entire area and bad rallying/ground game in areas. 

&#x200B;

Neocon's/ Never trumpers:

Pro's - Still have power and a few of those members were saved by the rallying of Trump. They now have a perfect scapegoat in the house to not do there job and push the agenda the people want.

Con's- They still aren't near as good at branding as either the democrats or Trump and so they will have a hard time getting there message out to the masses and also making it something others can agree with.

&#x200B;

Libertarian/ Tea Party:

Pro's - Still have a huge impact on candidates they support and hold more power now with Trump in charge because of their willingness to work with him. They still are gaining ground in the party as well and basically all the good candidates to follow Trump fall inside there circle of influence.

Con's - They are still unable to ratchet power away of democrats and neo con's. They also have a worst time at getting some of the other less prominent names out there.

&#x200B;

Trump: 

Pro's- He is basically Teflon as nothing really sticks to him and he was able to boast all races proving the Trump bump is real. He can rule by executive order if no one will work with him. He also has solidified voters barring a major breakdown he should be able to coax into his 2nd run relatively easy. His unique style and branding can't be answered by any other candidate.

Con's- He is surrounded by enemies on all sides and will have to deal with them if he wants to accomplish more.

A natural disaster example would be Yosemite erupting or a meteor strike.

"In reality, both groups are living in the exact same areas, the only difference is that liberals are living in densely populated areas and conservatives are living in sparsely populates areas.

It's not tiny blips on a map that are voting, it's the massive number of people that live there. If that's the point Watson is trying to make, that just makes it seem like he doesn't understand US population distribution and representation in the House.

Edit: Watson is basically like liberals trying to make a point about how more votes were casted for Dems in the Senate but the Republicans won anyways.

However, that's still only part of the problem. The other issue is the psycho-social brainwashing that's been going on since the 60's. I grew up in the 70's and 80's, so I saw the slide in values from the old B&W TV shows to the newer ones. In the past, personal responsibility and morality was always emphasized. So if something went wrong, it was usually ""your own damn fault"". Moving into the 80's and 90's, there were more stories about victimization and oppression...i.e. the problems were coming from around and above the main character. Also morality became ""flexible""...you started seeing spouses having affairs, but it was presented as ""OK"" because it was a bad marriage after all.

"Actually, I think that something like that would go in the opposite direction.   When people are in trouble, they want a lifeline to latch onto.  The democrats, while their ideas will inevitably fail, promise bigger government.  Scared people sign away their rights pretty easily.  I think that long term, we need to educate people to conservative economics and why our ideas work.  In the short term, we need to show the urban poor how the rich democrats continue to exploit them without ever improving their lives.  The rural poor have it much better than the city poor.  I think it‚Äôs going to get much easier now that we are cleaning up the GOP.  We have been infested with crony capitalist neocon globalists for a while.  We still have many of them in the party, but they are losing influence every day.  We are quickly becoming the party for the poor and disenfranchised and people are waking up to that every time they see their paycheck or after they receive a bonus at the end of the year.  We need to marginalize the neocons in our party and force the government to work on everyone‚Äôs behalf, not just the corporations.  There‚Äôs a reason that the MAGA movement and the Bernie Sanders movement sprang up at the same time, we are two different solutions to the same problem:  corporate corruption in politics.  Sanders promises to seize corporate assets and redistribute them amongst the people.  It‚Äôs a short sighted and jealous solution that will leave us worse off than we started.  We, on the other hand, want to use the government to incentivize corporations to work on behalf of the American worker.  We force them to come back to the US with tariffs and make it easy to move their money back home by not taxing the hell out of it.  Trump celebrates it when companies give bonuses and give tax breaks to make it possible.

"We have been waiting on the FISA release. It was DECLASSIFIED ALMOST THREE MONTHS AGO.

The President said this guy was going to give it a ""quick"" look, just to make sure the release doesn't compromise any intelligence gathering methods, & sources.(It wouldnt) What FISA would do is embarrass the shit out of the FBI, the United Kingdom, and Australia. 

FISA release would force at least some members of the press to cover and explain to the people who get their news from places like CNN, NPR, and MSNBC how this is is THE LARGEST SCANDAL IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY. How this is 100 times bigger than Watergate. The major networks will HAVE TO tell their viewers why they knew all about this for years, AND SAID NOTHING. 

I have no idea why but we are being used as pawns in GEOTUS 5d Chess game. He made it appear imminent that the FISA release was coming, then he walked it back. It was like he was trying to watch what the people who are terrified of FISA coming out, would do.. 

Rod Rosenstein apparently made calls and trips to the Whitehouse DEMANDING GEOTUS see him. Loretta Lynch lawyered up with a tremendously expensive and prestigious lawyer (WHY?). (ALLEGEDLY) James Comey and Andrew McCabe were meeting and talking on the phone together. (trying to scheme?)

 After Comey n McCabe talk, ""SOMEONE"" Leaks to the New York Times that Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire, and try to get members of the Trump cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment on him.

 Bruce Ohr meets with the House committee. ""CongressAnon"" says that Democrats kept trying to stop the interview. Everytime Ohr said something incriminating that certain Democrats would ""YELL"" into the microphone over Ohr. 5 recess's were called to try and retain order. One representative was heard saying "" No one survives this. "" 

Allegedly Bruce Ohr stated that 

1. McCain was active in the whole scheme.

2. At least 1 of the FISA judges were in on it.

3. Bill Priestapp, Ohr's boss encouraged meetings with foreign spy Chris Steele.

4. Someone in the room, on the committee questioning Ohr was also involved in the plot. ( This statement is what caused all the commotion, yelling into microphone to stop Ohr from speaking. )

5. SOMEONE ACTUALLY BROKE THE THERMOSTAT, ON A 97 DEGREE DAY IN HUMID WASHINGTON D.C! (This is what ended the day's line of questioning)

6.  Mark Meadows and another Congressman, when interviewed after gave a hint that Bruce Ohr's statements did NOT line up with things that Lisa Page had told them. That claimed they were happy with how things went, and incredibly shocked at the things they found out. They now want to re-question Lisa Page to see if she was lying under oath.

 Ohr was under incredible pressure to be honest, as beforehand the committee showed him they already possesed answers to most of the questions he would be asked. Also he was cooperating out of love, to keep his wife out of prison. Nellie Ohr is believed to have broken many many laws. She used a ham radio without a license, most likely to send information to her handlers without the NSA picking it up. (Nellie is believed to be CIA). (As is Rod Rosenstein's wife) 

So anyway, I am thinking that we were used and played to get all the above moves to be made, and have certain people in the so called "" Deep State"" show their hands. Its frustrating. I want FISA DECLASSIFIED now! I want the people who paid for the dossier, swore an oath and signed their names that the information was true, met with spies from our allies Nations to try and set up or frame the President as some kind of Russian puppet.

 I want Mueller and Rosenstein in jail for coming up with a special counsel, that's only job was to charge EVERYONE that the FBI illegally spied on, with a crime. I want these disgraces and fired FBI agents and Lawyers in Prison. I want Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Awan in prison for running a MOSSAD spy and blackmail operation in The House of Representatives.

 I want Comey and Loretta Lynch in prison for helping Clinton avoid Prison, ignoring massive amounts of evidence. I want Hillary in Prison for obvious reasons. I am not fucking around anymore.

What I and everyone is saying is that the video is sped up at certain parts which makes it look worse, and it seems like you're agreeing with that when you say they're not using the raw unedited footage.

I mean the edit isn't accidental. Someone would have had to get the video, open it in an editing software, then I guess accidently select those specific 10 or so frames out of many thousands, and then while selecting those frames accidentally edit them to speed them up a bit(normally by deleting them) and then slow the following frames down to make it all match up again.

Really?  Because the Sanders tweet is in response to both CNN and Acosta calling her a liar and denying he ever put a hand on the intern.

That is not why it was done.  This was in response to the CNN and Jim Acosta assertion that ""This is a complete lie. The woman grabbed Jim's arm repeatedly. He never once touched her.""

>I mean the edit isn't accidental... The only bit in  dispute is if Sanders knew about it beforehand.

OK, lets just say your knowledge of video editing is shockingly bad.  Been doing it for 25+ years and wow both you and the dude that posted the ""side by side"" comparison should stay away from speaking about it like you even know how video is handled when it is played.

The video was slowed down and zoomed in to show that yes, Acosta got physical with an intern doing her job.

Because I truly felt they were the evil idiots that the MSM made them out to be. How was I supposed to know they were just regular people like you or me? All I was ever taught from TV, was that these people were low educated redneck degenerates who lived backward lives. I truly believed they were racists because they voted for Bush. 

Holy fucking shit, life comes at you fast though. After I graduated high school, I joined the military and learned first hand that the people I grew up to hate, supported me because I was defending their rights. These were the same people who would give me the shirt off their backs if I needed it, and would thank me every day for my service. 

As I got older, I realized that I migrated to the right. No longer did I believe in leftist ideas of socialism or one world societies. No longer did I think every white person I met was a closet racist. No longer did I believe that I needed big daddy government to help me.

Finally someone that understands this. The commie media complex has so controlled the narrative post-World War II that even people on the right fall into it by using 'fascist' as an insult to even outed Communists - as though Communist isn't a bad enough distinction by itself.

I'll say it outright, Communists by and large have a far worse track record than Fascists - and I'd take it further: They aren't any better than Nazis. The Nazi regime didn't even kill half the people Stalin's regime did, and barely a fraction of the total deathtoll of Communists worldwide - of course commies dismiss this as 'yes, but their intent was good! It wasn't based on hate!' Really? The average Nazi had good intent, too - go back and time and ask any Nazi if his intent was 'based on hate' Heck, even Hitler had good intentions, they all do.

Another fallback argument is 'yes, but the Nazi regime showed \*cue ominous music\* the 'dangers of racism' =\_=' - well, then, since their deathtoll was a fraction of the Communists and their methods no less cruel, evidently the 'dangers of racism' are far less devastating than the dangers of radical Communism.",PingsBings,e9a7ddp,The_Donald

"Can confirm. About.... idk, maybe 8-10 years ago, during my late teens and early twenties, I was sent to a psychiatrist by my gastroenterologist, because it was believed my stomach issues were being caused by anxiety (biggest mistake of my life). Anyways, they started me initially on SSRI's. I told them I had no depression, but they said ""well, it may help your anxiety, which is causing your stomach issues,"" (turned out to be false, anyways). So I gave them a shot, despite not having depression. Now, suddenly, not only do I have depression, but I'm suddenly bi-polar. I'm alternating between fits of terrible depression, and then absolute mania, staying up for days on end, and pissing through all my money. I tell them, and they say, ""oh, not to worry. SSRIs can actually bring out underlying bi-polar if you have it, so we'll give you three more medications to treat the bi-polar."" I was baffled... ""but, I wasn't depressed, anxious, or bi-polar, until you put me on this? My stomach just hurts frequently?"" What was worse, was I started to truly believe I was a mental defect that suffered from all these conditions (that never existed until being put on meds to treat them). Anyways, they then threw me on klonopin, on top of everything else, and I turned into a zombie on autopilot. That's even how I described myself to them, and they said ""good! You've finally found baseline. Looks like we've found the right combo of medicine!"" I then began abusing the klonopin, finding other sedatives to self medicate, before I ultimately found myself in a 5+ year long heroin addiction.

Now - through this all, I was never a bleeding heart liberal, and that's not the point. I don't think these drugs change your political ideology (nor do I think that's what you meant, anyways), but they made me STUPID. Logic and reason, something I exercise daily now (no meds for years now lol), was non-existent in my seemingly schizophrenic mind. I was batshit insane. Still a conservative for the most part, but absolutely batshit insane. And I don't doubt that OP is right, that significantly more lefties are on these same kinds of drugs.

"I have a question for you, maybe someone on here knows the answer.  

Has Trump nominated someone to fill Cavanaugh's old seat on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals?  The Circuit court of appeals for the DC circuit is the SCOTUS ""Farm Team"", its the second highest court in the land, and its where you go when you're on the short list for SCOTUS.  Right now, ACB is on the circuit court of appeals for the 7th circuit (I think that's based in Colorado).  A president can obviously choose to elevate someone to SCOTUS from pretty much anywhere; Barry Obama, for example, elevated Elena Kagan from Solicitor General (she wasn't a judge at the time of her appointment).  However, the last 3 SCOTUS nominees (Garland, Gorsuch and Cavanaugh) were all on the 12th circuit court at the time they were nominated for SCOTUS. 


The 12th circuit has the same authority as the 7th circuit (they're both federal appeals courts) but the 12th circuit is the second highest court in the land because its the court with jurisdiction over Washington DC, and hears all appeals related to the federal government itself, which makes is position crucially important.  


If Cavanaugh's old seat is still empty (and I have to think it is), I want Trump to nominate ACB for that seat.  Move her up to the DC circuit court first, to get her on the SCOTUS short-list and get a tried and true conservative to replace Cavanaugh's old seat.  That puts her on the SCOTUS short list for not just the Trump administration but all future GOP administrations.  We have no idea how long Ruth Bader Ginsburg will live, after all.  Then Trump can pick a true conservative to fill ACB's old 7th circuit court seat.  

So, is Cavanaugh's old seat still open?  I think Trump should get ACB to fill it, don't you?

"As an avid trump supporter and Republican, I assure you the parties switched. In a way at least. It's not something that happened all of a sudden on one specific day. It's something that happened gradually. The party switch refers to the change in ideals of the two parties. Their stances on big government reversed and the areas that supported them reversed as well (there's a reason they use to be called southern democrats). The one thing that did not change is the support for big business. Both the old and new Republican parties are the party of big business. Most historians pin the start of the switch to early 1900s when a few Democrats began supporting using big government to support social justice. Their success lead to even more Democrats choosing to run on this platform. Leading to an odd time in American history betwren 1900-late 1920s where both major political parties where pro-big government. Leading into the 1930s with the New Deal, Republicans cemented their stance of supporting small government with their opposition to the New Deal.

Now, the question about why the parties changed, well it had nothing to do with trying to get African American support. It was about gaining support in the newly settled west. The west had the largest wage gap between poor and rich because of the dichotomy between railroad companies and lowly farmers. So, they gained the farmers support by funded social programs that would take from the rich and give to them and narrow the wage gap. This is why the big business support never changed. Prior to the Democrats implementation of social justice, big government was good for big business, gge Republican supported railroad expansion was heavily supported by big business but, was heavily opposed by the small government Democratic party of the time. However, with the rise of social programs and regulatory laws on businesses, big government became bad for big business. ",CrimsonChymist,e9aiewp,The_Donald

"Coolidge was incredibly hands-off in the 1920's in a time where the banks should have been put on a shorter leash.  Debt became rampant.

There were definitely some economic and ideological stances that altered over time, but when indoctrinated lefties cry about a party switch, it's never in regard to the stuff you said.  It's entirely about ""the racists"" because that is the only thing they're programmed to think about.

And if that's the front they want to make this accusation on, let's address it there.

Woodrow Wilson (Democrat):  Allowed Birth of a Nation to be shown at the White House.  Yikes.

FDR (Democrat):  Didn't even acknowledge the accomplishments of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics.  

LBJ (Democrat):  Together, he and FDR are the founding fathers of the Welfare State (war on poverty, project housing, etc).  Lots of extremely racist quotes have been attributed to him.

The latter is the kicker and it disproves anything they say.  You have the pinnacle moment of ideals that the modern day Democrat Party still embraces (the government's primary function is to provide, not protect) to this day.  Bill Whittle and Larry Elder explain it better than anyone:  it was a strategic switch.  Create a system of government dependency for the ""lower class"" so they *never* dare to vote against your party ever again.

The welfare state is a voter plantation, and it was designed for that sole purpose.  It's not about equality, or coexisting, or any of that Marxist code language.  It's about one thing:  control. ",VinceOnAPlane,e9akfvg,The_Donald
"The link you provided refers to 2008 and has nothing to do with the supposed party switch that allegedly happened between 1850 and 1936. It's central prediction is also humorously wrong. ""In parallel, the Democratic Party will increasingly
appeal to pro-business, social liberals, so the party takes on the mantel of Lincoln."" The Democrat party does *not* appeal to those that are pro-business, it appeals to those that are pro socialism, high taxes, and wealth distribution. So, you would have us believe the parties switched sometime between the late 1800s and the early 1900s. Then how do you explain the fact that it was *Democrats* that filibustered the Civil Rights Act in 1964?",-StrangerThanFiction,e9anqjh,The_Donald

"There is no reasonable argument that can be made to say that the party switch changed the sides viewpoints on race. Anyone who argues such is a fool. It really takes a fool to believe that the freeing of the slaves was because the north felt morally opposed to slavery and nothing else. The fact of the matter is that the north was arguably more racist than their southern counterparts. Mistreatment of African Americans by slaveholders was sparse. Because they saw slaves as an investment. States without slavery did not see them as equals. Far from it. The whole reason behind the civil war was that the north did not want slavery moving into the west and the south saw that as an attack on their livelihoods. But, the north's reasoning wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred the people who were slaves. They refused to live in close proximity with African Americans. At least, that was the case for the vast majority of the northern population. That's why tensions between white and black people increased dramatically after the civil war. Southerners felt they had been robbed of their livelihood and northerners couldn't stand to be around them. That's what led to segregation and things like the Jim crow laws. That's why you still see segregation in the north to this day. The north made it incredibly difficult for African Americans to ever move into their neighborhoods. Meanwhile, in the south you see far better dispersion of races throughout the community  You still see some small pockets of predominantly white or predominantly black communities but, they are typically smaller with less of a difference in crime and poverty levels.

It really could be said that just like the main viewpoint of the Republican Party looking out for big business didn't change, the Democrats views on African Americans hasn't really change. The old Democrats saw African Americans as nothing other than a monetary expenditure they could use as a tool to accomplish their goals. That's still the case, but the ways they control those people have simply changed. ",CrimsonChymist,e9arboi,The_Donald

"I‚Äôm not sure why everyone on this sub hates Rubio. He‚Äôs not a strong fighter like our President, but he‚Äôs not a RINO traitor like you know who, Flake, and Murkowski. He votes MAGA in the Senate and he appeals to moderate, Republican leaning voters. 

We need to have people like Rubio in the party. Not as leaders, and not as the majority of the party, but as representatives of moderate purple suburban districts that will support a lot of Trump‚Äôs agenda when they actually get to congress, even if they go back and campaign on being a ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô. 

Acosta is not a reporter, he‚Äôs an activist. It‚Äôs a bit virtue-signally for Rubio to go on about how the White House shouldn‚Äôt revoke passes for people they don‚Äôt like, but he‚Äôs not really wrong about that. Trump doesn‚Äôt revoke passes for people he doesn‚Äôt like, in fact, he sits there and takes a very large number of questions from reporters from news outlets that immediately lie about what he said. 

He revoked Acosta‚Äôs pass because Acosta is an activist who does nothing but interrupt press conferences with obnoxious, fake news questions, and has now shown himself to be physically belligerent in the process. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with what Trump did so Rubio is annoying for whining about it on Twitter in a double sided way, but he‚Äôs not a traitor RINO like some others who thankfully are no longer in Congress.

They‚Äôve officially over-sold their narrative. The only appropriate response to what they claim to believe is a violent revolution. A protest at this point only shows compliance with the new regime. You only protest when you believe your voice still influences the government. You cannot believe that and believe the government is fundamentally compromised at its highest level at the same time. 

It‚Äôs literally the moment where Sheev Palpatine claims to be the senate in their little narrative. That‚Äôs not a trigger to protest. That‚Äôs a trigger to blow up a Death Star.

"Impeachment isn't the trial. The House decides to impeach or not impeach with a simple majority. Impeachment however is mearly the first step. Impeachment is like being charged with a crime. 

If the House does impeach, (does charge with a crime) the Senate THEN decides after a trial TO convict (with a 2/3rds majority or 67/100 votes) or NOT convict (failure to reach 67 votes). This is similar to a jury having to unanimously vote guilty. 

Edit: a case could be made that controlling the House means never being charged in the first place = more valuable as the Senate could be controlled by the DEMs but still not get anywhere near a 2/3rds supermajority.

#LOLCATS



This has been long overdue. Not only is Acosta rude and disruptive, he has no objectivity whatsoever. He is an opinionist, not a ""reporter."" 




Here's a big yucky clue as to why Acosta has been such a troublemaker:




**Jim Acosta on Twitter, 25 Apr 2015:** [**""Huma Abedin and yours truly about to hit the red carpet #WHCD""**](https://twitter.com/acosta/status/592106367961440256?lang=en)



Two months before President Trump announced his campaign (on June 16, 2015) here we have Acosta openly boasting about being **on a date with Crooked Hillary's 2nd-in-command.** Trump had just left ""The Apprentice"" show in February, so there was speculation that he was preparing to run for President. 



This is the night that Worst 0bama's speechwriters decided it would be a good idea to roast Our Future President with a smugtarded teleprompter-reading of insults, which as we know now had the opposite effect than desired. But more importantly: while that was going on, Jim Acosta and Huma Abedin were canoodling and deal-making like a low-rent Peter Strzok and Lisa Page (with even less sex appeal.)



**AND ACOSTA BRAGGED ABOUT IT ON TWITTER** hahahahahahaha

Liberals do not want equality. They want the world exactly the way they dictate. If they don't get it through a popularity contest they legitimately believe they are entitled to use force.

Liberalism is the opposite of caring, the opposite of fairness. It is a false belief that one is morally superior and use of that self-supremacy to justify the hurt and destruction of anybody and anything that stands in the way of personal goals.

When liberals speak of ""free press"" they don't want a free press, they want the personal right to twist information however they want.

When liberals speak of ""marriage equality"" they don't want equality, they want a special deal only for gay people and to hell with the social fabric of society, to hell with children, to hell with polygamists, serial monogamists, and the forever single.

They want to harness that energy and then try and bend it to the will of the establishment Democrats. This will fail. 

With Pelosi as speaker now all she will be able to rein that dangerous wing in the short term but for the long term the Dems have a huge problem in 2020. Pelosi has doomed the Democrats in 2020. If she tries to harness the socialist energy she has to obstruct Trump's economic agenda. Before this win she could credibly point to the RINO's as the forstalling force with her simply supporting them. Now she is in the drivers seat. Budget failures are on her, the failure to build the wall is on her, if she tries to increase taxes to placate the commies Trump can veto and look the hero.

> President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration. We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern...

> This conduct is absolutely unacceptable. It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter‚Äôs colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question. President Trump has given the press more access than any President in history.

> Contrary to CNN‚Äôs assertions there is no greater demonstration of the President‚Äôs support for a free press than the event he held today. Only they would attack the President for not supporting a free press in the midst of him taking 68 questions from 35 different reporters...

> ...over the course of 1.5 hours including several from the reporter in question. The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it‚Äòs an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration

> As a result of today‚Äôs incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice.

"This is exactly what CNN wanted, and what they've been trying to do with Acosta ever since Trump took office.

Have Acosta act like a civil rights leader and annoy Trump and administration, and hope they bar him from entering. Then they can screech about the free press is being attacked by the President. 

They get to get virtue points from Acosta's questions, and then score even more after he gets barred. Win win for them.

Except the Trump admin knew how bad it'd look. Obviously Acosta should have been banned a long time ago, he'a annoying and has an opinion about people and the situation before even asking the question, and he's just a rude dick with no manners. But they knew if they banned him, all the normies would see is a brave civil rights vigilantee getting banned for asking the wrong questions, just reinforcing CNN's narrative. So they decided they wouldn't ban him, until they has a good excuse.

Well they just found one. In reality it wasn't an attack, it was just extremely rude and forceful behavior that is unacceptable in the White House, especially as a reporter. Plus, it was to a women, which invokes the sympathy points and makes people doubly mad at Acosta. The average normie will see two stories; those who only read the headline will think Acosta straight up attacked a women. Those who watch the video will just think Acosta's a fucking dick. Perfect for Trump's purposes (getting him OUT).

This wasn't an attack or real violence, it was just an example of the lack of class Acosta has. Not because it was a women, but because as an adult in a professional setting you don't act that way. It's just so spazzy and autistic and embarrassing, he's like a child who won't wait his turn. He seriously think's he's like MLK Jr., or some other progressive idol. Instead he comes off as an ass. That, plus all his other BS, makes me happy he's out.

This is similar to what the past 100 years od progressivism has caused. We have entire generations beng raised being spoon fed the narrative of racism and White oppression, that a free market is bad. They're raised on idols like MLK jr., and they want to copy them. And they're becominf very violent. I know so many White leftists who honestly think all Whites should be killed, that all of Western culture is purely will, etc. And they think violence is acceptable because of that, all the while retaining their smug sense of moral superiority, when in reality they are filled to the brim with hate, extremely entitled (communism), and merely have tribalistic empathy, not true universal empathy.

Boehner has met with Trump to discuss cannabis legalization. The meeting was private but I get the feeling it went pretty good.

"It's hard to tell whether or not the ""karate chop"" was intentional. His hand was already gesturing and moving up and down when she grabbed the mic. But it did look like he got more aggressive and swung his arm down a bit faster in that moment. Then, he said ""pardon me."" As someone trying to be fair here and not looking through a political lens filled with double standards, I would not call this assault.  With that being said, she attempted to grab it from him at least three times (as was her job. You saw her pass the mic to numerous reporters, before she jumped up) and each time he moved his body ever so slightly away from her in order to keep it. His behavior was disrespectful to everybody, but that's to be expected with Acosta grandstanding, whenever he gets the chance.

What still baffles me is how people can be okay with his behavior and say GEOTUS was rude or whatever. An answer you don't like is still an answer. He even said something along the lines of that being a matter of opinion . . . But that's what the press do on a daily basis. ""I don't like your answer, Mr. President. Let me ask it again."" No! I'm smart enough to put two and two together. President Trump might not be an articulate person, but I don't need him to answer the same question twice, even when he does skirt around them. He's way more direct than anybody else. Hell, he openly said, ""I will blame them. You do understand that, don't you?"" No politician would ever admit how they play their game. GEOTUS doesn't care.

assault

1) v. the threat or attempt to strike another, whether successful or not, provided the target is aware of the danger. The assaulter must be reasonably capable of carrying through the attack. In some states if the assault is with a deadly weapon (such as sniping with a rifle), the intended victim does not need to know of the peril. Other state laws distinguish between different degrees (first or second) of assault depending on whether there is actual hitting, injury or just a threat. ""Aggravated assault"" is an attack connected with the commission of another crime, such as beating a clerk during a robbery. 2) n. the act of committing an assault, as in ""there was an assault down on Third Avenue.""

LMAO there's a fucking video of it. he CLEARLY push her arm down and it startles her to the point where she is caught off guard. He was rougher than you would expect a reasonable person to be. I doubt any one has ever physically forced her away like that before. poor girl is clearly a bit stunned by it. 

Fact is he doesn't RAISE his arm to 'defend' whatsoever.

For those out of the loop about most of these recent mass protests, they are a distraction, a tamper tantrum, and scientifically objectively speaking, no results are ever achieved. These aren‚Äôt exactly civil rights level marches but superficially emotional ones. These mass protests only achieve to water down the effectiveness of protests that those in the past have done for actual legit grievances.
If we all check back afterwards, we‚Äôre all pretty much guaranteed see the same results as every single protest since occupy wall street to pipeline to march for our lives to pussy hat: zero.
Only losers? Thousands of city workers picking up cringey signs and starbucks latte frappe soy milk cups.

"Also.... The Democrats got the house due to an unprecedented number of (over 30) ""Republicans"" retiring, resigning, or moving on to other things...

I wonder for what reason, and why so many ""Republicans"" chose to not run for re-election in a super important midterm..

""COUGH COUGH MCCAIN COUGH""

It wouldn't be because they were dirty or compromised, and someone or some group told them its ""retirement or jail""? That's just a huge conspiracy theory to try and explain a totally  UNPRECEDENTED event with MASSIVE political implications happening.

So when we think about how historically when one party wins the Presidency, two years later (almost always) the same party loses the house. Now we look at how all these quitting or retiring ""Republicans"" could have easily kept their seats, due to being the incumbent. (Incumbents traditionally have a huge advantage for re-election.)

When we step back and look at it than... 
Donald Trump may have been one of the VERY FEW, or even the FIRST Presidents to have his party keep the House majority two years after his election victory. That is and would have been MASSIVE news.

So now we have to ask ourselves an uncomfortable question or two....

1. What could have possibly happend to make so many Republicans, decide not to run for re-election? These guys almost certainly would have won due to being an incumbent.. 

And...

2. How much does it speak to Donald Trump's popularity that, had such an unprecedented event not occured the Republicans would have kept the House, Senate, Supreme Court, and the Presidency?

It tells me the old Rino guard is being forced out, or giving up. It tells me that a massive amount of everyday people are waking up and walking away from leftism. Democrats, again are now drawing "" RED LINES IN THE SAND"". 

Democrats are now demanding that acting AG Whitaker recuse himself. People like Eric Holder, who were held in Contempt of Congress for his refusal to hand over documents that would have proved, his actions ended in the murder of a US Officer. Holder was subpoenaed, and just NEVER SHOWED UP. Now he is talking about how we are a "" nation of laws""?

Clowns like Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Diane Feinstein, and Blumenthal are SCREAMING about the Sessions situation. News anchor Tucker Carlson has a ANTIFA MOB sitting outside his home, harassing his family, and making death threats. What are THEY trying to INTIMIDATE Tucker Carlson from DRAWING ATTENTION to? Jim Acosta hits a women trying to peacefully remove a microphone from his hands, due to his childish behavior. Acosta is now barred from the WH, giving him the ammunition to say "" Trump is violating the free press"" , the very thing he has been desperately seeking for the past two years.

"It would be amazing if some hardcore conservatives hitters/groups (like Chik-Fil-A) and just some general conservatives people (just regular ol' citizens) came out and showed some kindness to their whiny asses. While they're out there, in the cold and crying because someone will be stopping a two-year long investigation that has failed to produce anything and has been filled with members that had to be dragged in front of the ethics committees for violations and for destroying evidence, the conservatives can be handing out things like hot chocolate and snacks. 

We don't agree with them, but it would be a great way to show John Q. Average-American the amazing contrast between the two groups. One goes out and marches because they didn't get exactly what they wanted (and then elects to have their speakers talk about blowing up the White House or suggesting that people they don't like be killed) and the other says ""Hey, we're all Americans and we all need to look out for each other. It's cold, stay warm and be healthy.""

That would be the biggest middle finger of all. Turn their paid protest into something that would inevitably win red votes. If they don't like it and get violent or mean, cameras immediately point at them and they just showed up on national TV attacking someone that was not only supporting their right to protest but also trying to make sure that they were okay, comfortable, and warm while protesting. 

Conservatives showing themselves to be the loving and caring ones in this - all while the others side is chanting for death and violence - will be an enormous uptick in popularity and will expose the Democrats for what they are. This needs to happen.",TheyreToasted,e99rjf5,The_Donald

Tons of individual races had hundreds of thousands of dollars thrown into them by leftist billionaires and were decided by a few hundred to a few thousand votes in many cases.  Also there was a suspiciously high turnout on the democrat side in a lot of areas, like, an almost impossibly high turnout (equal to, or exceeding 2016 presidential turnout).  So, something to think about.

This is another example of idiot CNN falling for another of Trump's genius moves. Trump just fired Sessions and the left is up in arms. Now he distracts with this Acosta move and suddenly we're all talking about this and CNN will fall right into his plot - again and again and again.  They really have no concept of strategy! Idiots.  And note I fully support firing Sessions and putting in someone to restrict that Mueller investigation.

"It seems to me after you vote you should receive a receipt with a long number string. Then you can check that number string against an online database of tallied votes to make sure your number string matches the vote assigned to it. Everyone will be able to see which number string voted for which candidate, but since the number strings are random and anonymous, no one would know who you specifically voted for, as long as you don‚Äôt share your number string with anyone. 

If you log onto the database and see the vote assigned to your number string was changed, then you can contact the polling station with the evidence (receipt vs. official online tally), which will eliminate some of your anonymity, but not all of it. If they are unwilling to look into the discrepancy, then you can go to the press with the evidence or your local party‚Äôs office. 

But since everyone would have the ability to verify their votes online, I don‚Äôt think they would be changed, so that whole scenario would be unlikely to occur.

Told defend America from her enemies at all cost, die for her if you must

Comes home

Turns on TV, ""Trump is the enemy of America, absolute Hitler, must be stopped at all cost""

"if it was a jerk i would think that the picture would be of him with it locked out overhead because that looks more impressive, although he could just have not liked that picture as much. and the fact that he used to play football increases the likelihood that this is just a power clean. 

and as for the grip, pretty much every football player on my highschool team had an awful rack position. the bar would typically be caught by and supported entirely by the wrists only and then afterwards sort of settle onto the collar bones if it was heavy enough. a proper rack position would be across the front delts. this guy has it just sitting on his collar bones which indicates likelihood that he doesn't know much about the proper rack position, but it is possible that he just doesnt have that wrist flexibility in old age, but if his wrists were that bad then that just further decreases the chances of him doing a jerk. i don't even think you can really do a jerk from this position tbh (can't really transfer much force into the bar through the collar bones) although i guess it is possible.  
of course if he's doing a push press then all this stuff about proper rack position goes out the window, but a push press with this weight would be more difficult, and having the starting position be that low is unlikely but i guess if he's coming out of a clean then it's understandable

verdict: probably a power clean (his former football career). he is not preparing to do a jerk (rack position)",god_emperor_jeb,e9a088h,The_Donald

I couldn‚Äôt gain annny muscle with borderline low t, but getting me to the middle normal range and I can actually put on some muscle. It‚Äôs not a cheat code. It‚Äôs hard. Fucking. Work. ",Do_u_ev3n_lift,e9aj9u2,The_Donald
"You are right about the mens health clinics, which gives actual trt a bad name. They will happily put you in supra-physiological range, along with a little deca for the joints, and var for the waist, and gh peptides for the skin and sleep. Though I begin to think you are conflating medical TRT with abusive dosing such as AAS users use and those health clinics give, I just wanted to point that out. Also TRT is a legitimate medical intervention, and isn't just for aging men who want their test levels to be where they were when they were younger. 

Though you are wrong about there being no broadly accepted physiological range. The ranges on blood work are not just for insurance purposes. Those ranges don't account for age, but they are the minimum and maximum, so if you are going to a GP, or endocrinologist, they will most likely put you somewhere in the middle if you have low testosterone. Or more common is they will give you the standard dose of 100mg of testosterone a week and leave it at that. If you are going to a men's health clinic they will probably put you right at the top, to where an 18 year old would be no matter the age. 

With all that said, I challenge you to take even abusive doses of steroids, and not work out, and see what happens. You might gain some size from the water retention from them and fat you build from the increase in calories that will most likely follow but you wont look like tom fitton. You wont get guns like that unless you work out, and use anabolics. ",gitfetchmorecoffee,e9aj2vq,The_Donald
"Just for the record, I'm going to point out you are right about the costs of TRT, I have been on it since I was 24 due to past anabolic steroid use along with long term opioids from sport related injuries and TBI. You are also right about recovery from TRT.  As chances of that happening are slim, even with a restart protocol. I was on doctor prescribed TRT for years until I realized I was better off administering it myself, along with the reduction in costs. I use my own protocol of daily low dose test prop shots, Sub-q injected, along with low dose hcg twice a week, I keep my levels around the area of before anabolic steroid use. Which was the same level when I was 19. This protocol has allowed me to keep my levels where I feel the best without health issues and without the use of anti aromatase drugs. 

If I don't workout, I lose muscle just like everyone else, albeit not at the pace that your standard soyboy would.",gitfetchmorecoffee,e9ak4mv,The_Donald

"I recommend looking up Jim Wendler and the Wendler 5/3/1 system.  4 lifts, one a day, 30 min sessions, 4 days a week, rest week ever 4 weeks, solid raw strength gains.  Powerlifting + strict press.

Three target sets of 3-5 reps are ideal, but usually you have warm up sets.

What a lot of people don‚Äôt focus on is the work:rest ratio.  Athletes training in Olympic weightlifting are recommended to do a 1:6 work test ratio.  Take you 60 sec to complete that set of 5 heavy back squats?  Rest 6 mins sitting down.  Has to do with the cellular energy your body relies on for heavy lifting and the time it takes to replenish.",_-Th0r-_,e99vh8y,The_Donald
"If it takes you 30 sec to do a set of 3 back squats, then rest 6 x 30 sec.  Sitting down.  The number one activity in pro Olympic weightlifting is sitting down.

In terms of rest days, if you are getting in without a lot of training, 3-4 days.   If advanced, 4-5. 

ATP-Phosphocreatine system supplies the energy for the raw power low rep lifts.  Higher reps use glycogen and eventually oxygen.  But the raw cellular energy is the slowest to recover between intervals.

1:6 is min ratio.  Up to 1:20.",_-Th0r-_,e99w6t7,The_Donald
"One of our high school gym teachers was also the head varsity football coach. He was a huge advocate of weight lifting and we had it incorporated into one of the units we did for the class.

They‚Äôll only prescribe HGH if you have a thyroid issue I think. They test for that.

What even is that? the U.S. is the world's superpower, the example that we must all strive to emulate, in this regard it is doing very poorly right now and must change its direction to deal with the parasites that are damaging your nation.

Moreover, I have heard rumors that in some places in the U.S., illegals are given the opportunity to vote in elections.... that's atrocious and shoudl never happen.

"Have some History folks:

No i'm not going to omit '64 and '68 where Lyndon B. Johnson held huge Democratic sway over Texas, or Nixon (39.9) vs. Hubert Humphry (41.1) vs. George Wallace (19) which was an exceptionally close run contest as noted by as near a 40:40:20 split as you're going to get. I'd argue thats an indicator of policy and promise than of anything else.

[1972 - Nixon at 66.2% where only very extemities south west of San Antonio hit blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1972)

[1976 - Indeed i'm not omitting 76 or 78 Gubernatorial elections in Texas either, both of which have a heavy Blue sway right across Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1976)

[1980 - Has another comparatively close contest based on context of Reagan vs. Carter which again divides Texas, with San Antonio heavily voting for Reagan at upwards of 80%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1980)

[1984 - Reagan being in office for 4 years swings Texas heavily red, except for areas immediately south west of San Antonio and now south of Corpus Christi which itself barely clings to red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1984)

[1988 - Bush Sr. vs. Dukakis in 1988 is another divisive race but now we are staunchly seeing the North vs. South voting pattern consistently, whilst the centre and eastern extremities fluctuate between Republican and Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1988)

[1992 - Bush sr. vs. Is a Rapist Clinton, 1992. Another divisve race with voting patterns similar to the above with the clear trends being similar, with north/south red/blue divide, whilst centre/east fluctuates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1992)

[1996 - Dole vs. Infowars.com Clinton. Pattern consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_1996)

[2000 - Bush Jr. vs. Manbearpig Nemesis. Heavy Republican favour, with centre/eastern areas of Texas much more heavily red. North/South divide still apparent - Note how all the cities remain Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2000)

[2004 - Bush jr. vs. Kerry. Texas remains consistent in pattern, however immediately north of Austin has narrowly swung blue, whilst Houston, San Antonio and Corpus Christi are significantly less Red than prior years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2004)

[2008 - Mc *retches* Mc *urp* Mccain vs. *heaves* Obama in 2008. The blue is beginning to creep further north and all 3 major cities, San Antonio, Austin and Houston, turn blue between 50 and 65%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2008)

[2012 - Romney vs. Osama in 2012 continues with traditional voting patterns with one major difference. The Large cities have now fallen to Blue and the South now matches the heavily saturated Dem base as the heavily saturated republican base in the North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2012)

[2016 - GEOTUS Donald J. Trump vs. Killary Clinton. Voting pattern is consistent with trends since 2004.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2016)

It is of course impossible to reach a complete conclusion simply from these comparrisons, but it is possible to create theories.
From 1964 until 2018 is a period of 54 years. This will span at least 2 generations but potentially a third. 
Consider that, in many cases in the elections of new presidents, the race seems to be fought intensely on politics, with Texas dividing itself pretty equally across the state, with no meaningful geographic points to note of.
Within 25 years however, North and South have solidified, with those on the Mexican border heavily favouring Democrats whilst the North favours republicans.
Within 50 years, the large cities of Texas have fallen to Democrats whilst the blue encroaches further and further north whilst solidifying in the south.

The fact this change over time becomes most apparent within these two time frames (25 years and 50 years) is roughly the time it'll take to have and raise a child - with cities being natural hotbeads of migration from rural areas, and for College Students looking to study as well as those newly entering the workforce and looking for work. 

I'd appreciate anyone looking into this to come up for an alternative theory as to these trends, as a Historian, i'd very much enjoy alternative theories as to what is swinging voters in these geographic locations that does not amount to a cultural allegiance. ",ShadowReaperX07,e9aaa1i,The_Donald

Something like 300 people move to Austin EVERY SINGLE DAY. Also, an absurd amount of money was spent on the Beta campaign. The guy was everywhere you looked. Combine this with a lot of republican voters not liking Cruz, and this was a bit of a perfect storm.

"I was born around 1960. By the time I was 30, my country was unrecognizable. I'm nearing 60 now and the social decay ""normalized"" by the Tolerant Left‚Ñ¢ in the name of ""Political Correctness"" is appalling, compared to the standards of behavior/public acceptability of my childhood years. 



Now I understand why my parents & grandparents were distressed at the ill effects the Leftist Agenda and Cultural Marxism were slowly inflicting on our society. I also understand why they taught me good values and demanded proper behavior, causing much distress on my part (at the time) as my peer group embraced the ""normalization"" of decadence and debauchery.  




I also understand why many Millennials (and Leftist ""adults"") give me ridicule for having appreciation for our forebears' aspirations of American Culture and Exceptionalism. I missed out on the indoctrination many of them received through TV shows and movies, and through their obsession with social-media narcissism. (This made it very easy for me to ""cut the cord"" several years ago, because I was not TV-obsessed to begin with. I was also an early adopter of the internet, so I was too familiar with the downsides of spyware/spying/stalking to go near the social-networking bandwagon.) 



I remember riots and college protests in my younger years. I do **not** remember MSM cheering it on and encouraging them. I also remember crime and gunplay in movies & TV, but I do not remember this being glorified as ""what all the **cool kids** are doing."" These were cautionary tales, not the lifestyle advertisement that they are now.  



And the ""education"" system, WEW LAD. What a mess. Lowering the grading standards and doing away with discipline set up a disaster that only Common Core could make worse. Most of the teachers in my family have retired or given it up for other work. (I have tremendous respect for anyone who still perseveres in K-12 teaching, though <3  Obviously **all** schools are not so bad, but too many are intolerable indoctrination centers rife with messy bureaucracy and uncontrollable ""students."")

"Eh, pride in unearned traits leans Identitarian.

Pride in deeds and accomplishments, even just taking part in your country, is fine.(national pride, patriotism, etc)

However:

Black pride, White pride, Gay pride, etc... these are movements breeding self entitlement of the farther left/right Identitarians, they use the same mechanics, even push for some of the same politics, they've just got different priorities of ""me first"".

See example:

I'm just _PersonalTraitX_.  I'm not ""proud"" of it.  I was born this way.  I just am.  I don't identify or take credit for the deeds of other _____ people.  People of PersonalTraitY don't owe me anything, don't have to stand up just so I get a seat.  I am self confident, but my skin color has nothing to do with it.

If I'm better at something, it's not because of my skin, it's because of my ability or accomplishment, some objective measure of merit.

___

I think using ""pride"" in place of ""I am not ashamed"" is a mistake.  Because it fosters race-related bonds, which naturally puts it at odds with people of other groups. Not that it's ""the wrong word"", but that it settles the subconscious to push us into certain thought patterns.  That's why specific language can matter, and why the left loves to rape known lexicons and scramble shit around.

"Some would consider the situation for indigenous Europeans and those of indigenous European descent as in an existential crisis. There is no country on earth that seeks to preserve the integrity, self-determination and future security of this group of people - due to the West wide policy of multiculturalism. 

You see multiculturalism, like separation of church and state seeks to separate nation (people) from state (system of government). Multiculturalism views a country not as a vehicle to protect and advance the interests of a particular group but simply as a place for economic exchange with no national mission or people for whom the country exists. Multiculturalism says that the space belongs to everyone and therefore no one, it's ""people"" doesn't exist. This is a problem for countries that used to be nation states and acknowledged that it served a defineable people (their European lineage and culture) but then imposed multiculturalism on its people. 

So what are the implications for the people that the state once formally recognised but now rejects? 

Naturally, a conflict of interest arises between the advocates of multiculturalism (who think that the countries people don't exist) and the people to which the state was formerly aligned.

The implication is that multiculturalism turns from a passive policy of simply being blind to other cultures and ethnicities to an active project of multiculturalization. The process of dismantling the society of the former nation state to transform it into a nationally and culturally neutral / culturally secular space. In other words, the successful implementation of the multicultural model assumes that the native inhabitants don't exist. Then multiculturalism must make them not exist. 

Multiculturalism is not simply an additive project of bringing in other people's and cultures but a destructive project which involves erasing and dismantling the culture and history of the former nation state to, a process of ethnocide.",Inquisitor-01,e9azp90,The_Donald

"Someone else probably has a better explanation but I'll give it a shot. 36 Republican House members either retired or ran for senate or a governorship. It's always easier for an incumbent to win than a new candidate. Not nearly that many Democrats retired. The Democrats took in much more money this cycle than the Republicans. Their usual big donors like Soros and Steyer, plus Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Wall Street and other NYC donors, plus other assorted leftists allowed Democrat candidates for House seats, especially in those targeted as vulnerable, to run a lot more ads, pay for people to knock on doors and put out signs, etc.

"I think it's a combination of things:

* Republican votes obviously aren't well distributed in enough numbers among different districts or not enough Republicans from all districts went out to vote; however, Republicans from certain areas overperformed DemocRATS enough to have a win at the state level.

* Some Republicans just couldn't think clearly enough to vote red even if their House Rep was a RINO traitor but liked their Senator and/or governor candidate.

* In case of states in which the Republicans won the governorship but not the Senate seat and/or not most House seats, a big factor could be that never Trumpers and even DemocRATS don't want their state to increase taxes, become sanctuary states, or become Venezuela so they voted for the Republican governor; however, they still hate Trump, so they didn't want to vote for Senators and Congressmen who would help Trump in Congress.

* I have no proof of this, but considering how corrupt the DemocRAT cheaters are, I believe it to be very possible that, every time DemocRATS lose by a narrow margin, they pay enough DemocRAT or ""couldn't-give-a-shit"" voters to move to these key districts where they had a narrow loss and they have also been doing some gerrymandering.",leing15,e99aw2m,The_Donald

It's that they are totally morally bankrupt.

When asked those questions they look sideways at other members of their heard to see how they are answering, or they look toward their celebrities and athletes and hollywood pedofiles etc to see how to answer.

They actually have good memories really. Remember when they were on some tv interview show and the guy told them Comey was fired? They all cheered and clapped because the last thing they were told about Comey is that he was bad for opening an investigation on Crooked. They remembered that months later, so they dutifully cheered when he was fired. The corrupt pervert celebrity had to quickly shut that down and reprogram them to change mode to outrage.

"No. Actually, to impeach they need a simple house majority. To *convict*, they need 2/3 of the senate. Spread the word because I keep seeing inaccurate info! It's a confusing issue since most people think impeached means removed from office. It just means ""indicted"", basically. Here's more detail from the Failing New York Times (but it's actually accurate for once):

""First, the House of Representatives votes on one or more articles of impeachment. If at least one gets a majority vote, the president is impeached ‚Äî which essentially means being indicted. (In both the Nixon and the Clinton cases, the House Judiciary Committee considered the matter first.)

Next, the proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.

A team of lawmakers from the House, known as managers, play the role of prosecutors. The president has defense lawyers, and the Senate serves as the jury.

If at least two-thirds of the senators find the president guilty, he is removed, and the vice president takes over as president.""

However, I don't think they'll impeach him. They'd have to have almost all of the house dems vote to impeach, it would be unpopular with voters and create a circus they probably don't want.

He was done with questions (from the President's words) and her job was to take the mic and give it to someone else. Not battery. 

I will freely admit, though, that I find it difficult to understand the difference between assault and battery. My understanding is that battery is actually the act of unwanted touching, causing injury or not. Assault seems to be the threat of bodily harm. Which is why they tend to be lumped together when charging. ""I'm gonna beat the shit outta you"", and then doing it would be assault and battery. Please let me know if this is not correct.

"Look at the Middle East and North Africa. Islam follows the same pattern of invasion/conquering of nations. 

At first it is small influx of Muslims that claim to be moderate that appear to assimilate. Once their numbers grow they start to build mosques. Then they start to run for local office and demand government protections of their beliefs - like demanding halal food in public schools, etc. once greater influence is gained they become more militant, eventually instituting Shariah courts that rule outside local government. No go zones appear. Muslim population increases and eventually they start to attack differing philosophies openly (Christianity) with violence and protest. Muslims run for and win higher offices and secure greater immigration of Muslims (see the mayor of London and what is happening there).  Once numbers reach >50% then they open up full on attacks on anything non-Muslim until either non-Muslims flee or are imprisoned or killed off. Eventually populations reach around 95-100% and you end up with Saudi Arabia where gays are thrown off buildings to their deaths and Christians are killed in the streets.

> Omar has been critical of Israel, referring to it as ""the apartheid Israeli regime,""[28] asserting that Israel has ""hypnotized the world"" to overlook the aerial bombardment of civilians, which she characterized as ""evil doings,""[29] recommending that the University of Minnesota divest from Israel bonds, and criticizing a law intended to prohibit the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Accused of antisemitism by a few right-wing critics, she has responded that her criticism of some of the Israeli government's actions in no way implies hatred of Jewish people: ‚ÄúThese accusations are without merit,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey are rooted in bigotry toward a belief about what Muslims are stereotyped to believe.‚Äù[28] At an August candidates forum held in a synagogue during the last week of the 2018 primary campaign, she said a boycott of Israel is not helpful in working toward a two-state solution, and that ""it is going to be important for us to recognize Israel's place in the Middle East and the Jewish people's rightful place within that region.""[29]

I disagree. Going to preface this by saying I don't subscribe to Roman Catholicism or any other sect of Christendom, though there are a few Roman Catholic historical figures I think are alright; the Roman Catholic Church was singularly innocent in the crusades, which makes them stand out among other political bodies in history. They had more justification to fight the crusades than America had for going to war over Pearl Harbor (imagine if Japan had, say, annexed a chunk of the West Coast), and the church's response was less extreme, even in a relative sense, compared to the ultimate American response in that war.

3. Sept.8,2016: Sessions office. Phone call with Kislyak.

4. Confirmation hearing: Sessions asked specifically about Russian contacts. Denies any contact.

5.March 2017: Wash Post reports on the meeting showing Sessions did have contact.

"***He*** didn't lose the House, and the House wasn't lost because of Sessions. 

The House was lost, in large part, because the Rs, effectively, gave it up. They ran poor candidates almost across the board and those candidates could have been said to have voted, ""Present"" on their campaigns, but you'd need to actually show up to vote, ""Present"", and they simply didn't. 

RNC and State Committees seemingly gave little support to any of their candidates and seemingly none of them even wanted to win. It's as if they didn't even know there was an election.

Voter apathy was a large factor as well. Third party candidates siphoned off votes in a bunch of those R-to-D ""flips"" \[though it's not really fair to call them flips because they weren't running against incumbents\], and in races where they didn't, there were a lot of close contests. Even a little bit more support from R voters who sat out could have been the difference in many of those races. Likely Rs and 2016 ""Trump"" Rs didn't show up in huge numbers. To a degree, you can't blame them.

Don't forget that, after getting trounced in a legitimate blue wave that gave the Ds a much bigger majority than they currently enjoy in the House and a sizeable majority in the Senate, the Rs roared back in 2010, saw phenomenal results in 2012, 2014 and won with Lord Trump in 2016 - in large part on repealing the ACA; when they finally had the ability to do so, they failed. 

They literally retired forty-something incumbents with no strategy to hold those seats, and seemingly no desire to. 

I'm no conspiracy theorist, but I suspect GOPe shot-callers pushed for poor, weak candidates to run and intentionally gave them little to no money to work with while colluding with the State Committees to stifle their ground game. 

Given the apathy and anger of the electorate and the way the Rs seem to have done all they could to lose, the Ds *should* have had a much better night.

"Roger Stone recently [exposed](https://larouchepub.com/other/2018/4538-roger_stone_it_s_a_fight_for_t.html) Mueller and this entire Russiagate hoax for what it is: 

>Mueller can find no Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. ‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù is defined as coordination, conspiracy, working in concert. That never happened. Yeah, we have evidence of Russian meddling in our election. Do we think that we in the United States have not meddled in foreign elections, specifically in Russia? Who do you think financed the election of Boris Yeltsin? Why, that would be Uncle Sam. Were we interfering in the most recent Israeli elections? You bet your ass! That‚Äôs what we do.

>But now we act like this low-level, ham-handed, ineffective Russian meddling, most likely done by people who have English as a second language based on their social media output, which had no effect whatsoever on the election, is being held up as proof of the success of Mueller‚Äôs probe...

>Mueller is an interesting fellow. He is the man who covered up Saudi involvement in the 9/11 attack on the United States. There were no less than 16 reports from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement‚Äîthat‚Äôs our state police‚Äîabout strange men who were training at a Sarasota, Florida-based flight school. Mr. Mueller failed to investigate those tips, but then, after the fact, investigated a local Sarasota-area Saudi family that was harboring these men in their home. These Saudis had disappeared in the dark of night, leaving behind all their personal effects: their cars, their clothing, their jewelry. And Mr. Mueller certified to the Congress and to the people of the United States that there were no ties between that Saudi family and the 9/11 plot. We now know that that was a lie. Freedom of Information Act-acquired documents from the Federal government prove it.

>But then again, it was Mr. Mueller who let four men rot in a Boston jail, who he had convicted of murders that he knew they didn‚Äôt commit, solely because it would have exposed Mafia FBI informants in the Whitey Bulger case. Then there was the anthrax scandal. Mueller arrested the wrong three men. The man he did ultimately arrest amazingly died in captivity within 24 hours of a Tylenol overdose.

"Well, acting AG doesn't go through an advise and consent process. So it really doesn't matter one hoot what the libs think about him. Clean it up before the House dems take over all the committees. And Trump has a firm grip with the new Senate, so anyone he permanently nominates will sail through regardless of Schumer's antics. 

Your idea also makes sense, but there is a unique opportunity here...

So the new acting AG calls an immediate meeting with Mueller, demands a full accounting for the status. He then redefines the scope to limit the investigation to criminal charges exclusively along the lines of Russian\\Trump collusion. Since Mueller has neither criminal basis for the investigation, nor evidence to support collusion, the acting AG can simply shut him down as having no basis to continue. 

Back it all up with publishing the unreacted FISA, be damned what our backstabbing ""allies"" in UK and Australia think about being exposed for their unlawful meddling. That document should make it abundantly clear that Trump was justified in firing Comey.",arob216,e99j73p,The_Donald

Another lie of the Democrats was that Republicans dont support insurance for pre existing conditions.  As we saw Trump trying to pass through health care legislation that double the pool of 8 billion to 16 billion for that very reason (thanks for blowing that McCain).

"> the only hope is to vote in a MAGA House majority in the 2018 midterm elections

Im not re-writing the script, it did not occur. Ryan and Co lost the House when they failed with Obamacare repeal, between the GOP House members retiring (40+ or something) and that failure after 7 years of running on THAT, the public just didnt trust them as a whole, and I dont blame them.  Many GOP House seats WERE won, but as a whole they fell short, and I believe the Obamacare failure was the main reason.

None of which changes ""the script"".

>I think the bigger question is how and why the ""old-guard GOP"" wasnt replaced in the Primaries by MAGA candidates?

Not sure that matters. MAGA candidates or no, the GOP (perhaps intentionally) lost the House when they failed to repeal Obamacare. MAGA candidates would most likely not have fared much better better in the few instances in which GOPe were the candidates and still lost to Dems. I think the problem was public perception of the GOP as useless.

>take a look at the Senate seats up for re-election in 2020

I think 2020 is much easier electorally. In both Houses. And this time, Trump really IS on the ballot, where just now he wasnt. He made the case, but I dont think that case was compelling to enough to people who were disgusted (rightfully so) by the GOP.

The Dem majority is tiny in the House, and we got rid of nearly all GOPe dead wood in both houses, a nice purge (with a few revolting exceptions like Romney in the Senate, but very few in the House, because they lost to Dems). Lets face it, the truth is the MAGA Agenda GOP didnt have a majority anyway. At least now they can be (more) honest in their obstruction.

The one thing that does bug me is the committee chairmanships and speaker role.. those are powerful tools the Dems have now.

On the bright side, I think Trump sacrificed unwinnable short term situation for longer term stability. We will any minute get a 3rd SCOTUS pick, tons of new judges will be confirmed, new appointments will go thru, and the Senate will block any retarded House measures from the Dems. But they will now spend 2 years doing nothing but attacking POTUS.",wrines,e9ax83z,The_Donald
