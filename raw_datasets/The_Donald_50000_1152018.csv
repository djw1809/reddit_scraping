Same shit happened to Reagan when he compromised with dems on immigration and then the dems didn't uphold their end of the deal by passing stricter laws on immigration.

"Liberals are [hypocrites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZXbG5gvoC0).

(**1**) Liberals promote abortion to poor mothers who can't afford diapers, but at the same time liberals are encouraging poor countries to have [anchor babies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9imilqanQ&t=21) in sanctuary cities where all [healthcare and education](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/27/illegal-immigration-costing-record-135-billion-year-study-shows.html) costs are paid for.

(**2**) Liberals want healthy [school lunches](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/11/high-school-students-start-social-media-protest-against-michelle-obamas-lunch-program) and a soda tax to prevent obesity, but then they'll turn around and say, ""Don't fat shame anyone. We need to accept [plus sizes](http://magaimg.net/img/6m2m.png).""

(**3**) Liberals say it's ""cultural appropriation"" for a teenager to wear a [Chinese dress](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a20123163/keziah-daum-prom-dress-cultural-appropriation-cheongsam-qipao), but then they'll [wear a hijab](https://clarionproject.org/feminism-hijabs-and-hypocrisy) to support Muslims.

(**4**) A man has a mental illness if he chops off his own leg ([Body Integrity Identity Disorder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x55IuSyIyQ8)). But liberals insist that an 11-year-old boy who wants to chop off his penis should be encouraged with  ""[hormone blockers](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/17/controversial-therapy-for-young-transgender-patients-raises-questions.html).""

(**5**) DACA kids shouldn't be blamed for the actions of their parents, but liberals say whites have privilege because of their ancestors.

(**6**) Liberals want background checks for gun buyers, but they don't want [voter IDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBxZGWCdgs&t=17) to prevent fraud.

(**7**) Liberals want to ""save the earth"" by reducing pollution, but chain migration will mean more cars, chimneys, and plastic bottles along with the [American lifestyle of consumption](https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2017/05/31/Carbon%20PP.PNG). Poor refugees in mud huts will want a TV, iphone, and microwave oven. This will increase [carbon emissions](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-india-2012-vs-india-2016-the-comparison-between-these-pics-from-nasa-shows-modi-s-india-is-truly-shining-2400572).

(**8**) Liberals want vaccinations for everyone's health, but the illegals are bringing diseases. ""People from Central and South America, ground zero for [Zika and other infectious diseases](http://canadafreepress.com/article/obamas-refugees-and-surging-deadly-diseases-in-america) including tuberculosis, dengue, Chagas, Chikungunya and schistosomiasis, make up nearly 15 percent of the illegal-immigrant population"".

(**9**) Giving someone [HIV](https://aidsetc.org/blog/bug-chasers-gay-men-and-intentional-pursuit-hiv-narrative-analysis) is no longer a felony in California. Sexual diseases are now spreading faster there, but liberals think it's because of ""[racism and stigma](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-std-stigma-20180507-htmlstory.html).""

(**10**) Liberals want to protect the ecosystem by removing [invasive species](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/red-grey-squirrels-cornwall), but they don't care if a foreign culture displaces [native citizens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzZ6--p01KM&t=10).

(**11**) Liberals lock the front door, wear a seatbelt, put a leash on a dog, or use a firewall for the internet. It's normal to think of security, but liberals want to open the border which allows in drug dealers, [sex traffickers](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Human-Trafficking-Soaring-in-Mexico-Rights-Groups-Warn--20171227-0025.html), MS-13 gang members, or Muslim extremists.

(**12**) Liberals want a minimum wage of $15 per hour, but illegals are taking jobs for ""[$5 to $6 an hour](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-06/californias-undocumented-workers-help-grow-economy-theres-cost)"" without paying [tax](https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/james-agresti/about-61-million-illegals-filed-taxes-us-many-didnt-pay-received-refunds).

(**13**) [Nancy Pelosi](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/15/pelosi-slams-company-bonuses-as-crumbs-despite-once-praising-40-tax-cut.html) wrote that Obama's $40 tax cut per paycheck was a ""victory"" that ""will make a difference."" But now she says $2,000 from Trump's tax cut would be ""crumbs"" that are ""pathetic"" and ""insignificant.""

(**14**) Bernie Sanders owns [3 houses](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2016/08/08/bernie-sanders-buys-a-summer-home-in-north-hero), made over [$2 million](https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-makes-one-million-dollars-second-straight-year-book-deals-992845) in 2 years, and paid only [4% to charity](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/15/sanders-gave-4-percent-income-to-charity-in-2014-tax-returns-show.html) in 2014. If Bernie wants a tax cut, then liberals will endorse it. But if Trump wants a tax cut, then liberals will [reject it in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctz_dHfYfb8&t=24).

(**15**) ""Over 37 percent of House Democrats have practiced school choice, but [96 percent of Democrats](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/congressmen_love_private_school_for_their_kids_) who practiced school choice voted against the voucher program.""

(**16**) Pelosi didn't want to read a [few thousand pages of Obamacare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-05TLiiLU), but Democrats wanted to read a [million documents](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/20/democrat-demand-documents-kavanaugh-obstruction) before Kavanaugh was voted in.

(**17**) Liberals in the #MeToo movement are against sexual harassment, but Hollywood liberals were [cheering for Roman Polanski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXnNOBj26lk&t=49) who raped a 13-year-old girl.

(**18**) Liberals want [girls to join](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/02/boy-scouts-scouts-bsa-girls-joining-cub-scouts/572036002) the Boy Scouts and get [free condoms](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2603273.stm). But liberal feminists wanted [only women](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4546284) at a Wonder Woman screening.

(**19**) [Liberal feminists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZHuFah0uds&t=38) want to break the ""glass ceiling,"" but they become silent when [Muslims oppress women](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3844392). Democrats won't even talk with a reformist who said, ""They completely [ignored us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi8tV9J7Vgo&t=10).""

(**20**) Liberals say illegals will do all the dirty work, but then they say we'll need a universal basic income because of [AI robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-JR2KDRnEY) in the [future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aPPXB7gqYU). So which is it? Import more workers or prepare for mass unemployment?

(**21**) Liberals say that Facebook is a private company that can ban anyone, but then they say a private bakery should be forced to write on a cake for a gay couple.

(**22**) Zuckerberg built a [6-foot-tall wall](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3665223) and picks up [dog poop](http://metro.co.uk/2018/04/03/pictures-mark-zuckerberg-didnt-want-see-7436124). He cares about his own privacy but [ignores user privacy](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/10/mark-zuckerberg-walls-off-his-house-but-ignores-users-privacy-apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says.html).

(**23**) Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey protests the [redistribution of his wealth](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6298961).

(**24**) Michael Moore praised [communist Cuba](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article1928212.html), but during his divorce it was revealed that he owned [9 homes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2705149).

(**25**) Obama said, ""There's only [so big a house](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/barack-obama-on-wealth-inequality-only-so-much-you-can-eat.html) you can have."" But the Obamas bought an [$8.1 million mansion](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/news/g2535/obama-new-house-photos) and may own [5 homes](https://dailycaller.com/2016/11/20/the-obamas-just-bought-a-fifth-house-and-this-one-is-really-far-from-home).

(**26**) Democrat Julia Salazar portrayed her family background as poor, but her brother said they grew up in a ""[beautiful neighborhood](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/julia-salazar-brother-mother-question-claims.html).""

(**27**) Liberals are against the [gentrification](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5106811) of urban areas. They don't want old buildings to get renovated with new shops because it would be ""unfair"" to push residents out. The reality is that **rich liberals** have been pushing away **poor liberals** for years by increasing the cost of rent. Democrats block the building of [low-income housing in California](https://sf.curbed.com/2018/1/8/16863362). Democrat Bill de Blasio wouldn't talk with a [homeless woman in New York](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6246457).

(**28**) Liberals want illegals to flow in and vote Democrat, but liberals won't talk about solutions to stabilize the 3rd World. Birth rates decline naturally the richer a nation gets, but liberals don't want to industrialize other countries because of climate change. [Obama said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlgMwxcsOOE) poor Africans can't have cars or air conditioners. Meanwhile rich liberals like [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9xFFyUOpXo&t=7) use a sports car, [private jet](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3044176), or yacht.

&nbsp;

Liberals think we can smile, hold hands, and *live happily ever after* in a socialist utopia. The reality is that [naive liberals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u4Vlgr2iHs&t=8) support more taxes, regulations, and identity politics.",bsmith76,e93y6ea,The_Donald

"Liberals are [hypocrites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZXbG5gvoC0).

(**1**) Liberals promote abortion to poor mothers who can't afford diapers, but at the same time liberals are encouraging poor countries to have [anchor babies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9imilqanQ&t=21) in sanctuary cities where all [healthcare and education](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/27/illegal-immigration-costing-record-135-billion-year-study-shows.html) costs are paid for.

(**2**) Liberals want healthy [school lunches](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/11/high-school-students-start-social-media-protest-against-michelle-obamas-lunch-program) and a soda tax to prevent obesity, but then they'll turn around and say, ""Don't fat shame anyone. We need to accept [plus sizes](http://magaimg.net/img/6m2m.png).""

(**3**) Liberals say it's ""cultural appropriation"" for a teenager to wear a [Chinese dress](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a20123163/keziah-daum-prom-dress-cultural-appropriation-cheongsam-qipao), but then they'll [wear a hijab](https://clarionproject.org/feminism-hijabs-and-hypocrisy) to support Muslims.

(**4**) A man has a mental illness if he chops off his own leg ([Body Integrity Identity Disorder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x55IuSyIyQ8)). But liberals insist that an 11-year-old boy who wants to chop off his penis should be encouraged with  ""[hormone blockers](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/17/controversial-therapy-for-young-transgender-patients-raises-questions.html).""

(**5**) DACA kids shouldn't be blamed for the actions of their parents, but liberals say whites have privilege because of their ancestors.

(**6**) Liberals want background checks for gun buyers, but they don't want [voter IDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBxZGWCdgs&t=17) to prevent fraud.

(**7**) Liberals want to ""save the earth"" by reducing pollution, but chain migration will mean more cars, chimneys, and plastic bottles along with the [American lifestyle of consumption](https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2017/05/31/Carbon%20PP.PNG). Poor refugees in mud huts will want a TV, iphone, and microwave oven. This will increase [carbon emissions](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-india-2012-vs-india-2016-the-comparison-between-these-pics-from-nasa-shows-modi-s-india-is-truly-shining-2400572).

(**8**) Liberals want vaccinations for everyone's health, but the illegals are bringing diseases. ""People from Central and South America, ground zero for [Zika and other infectious diseases](http://canadafreepress.com/article/obamas-refugees-and-surging-deadly-diseases-in-america) including tuberculosis, dengue, Chagas, Chikungunya and schistosomiasis, make up nearly 15 percent of the illegal-immigrant population"".

(**9**) Giving someone [HIV](https://aidsetc.org/blog/bug-chasers-gay-men-and-intentional-pursuit-hiv-narrative-analysis) is no longer a felony in California. Sexual diseases are now spreading faster there, but liberals think it's because of ""[racism and stigma](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-std-stigma-20180507-htmlstory.html).""

(**10**) Liberals want to protect the ecosystem by removing [invasive species](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/red-grey-squirrels-cornwall), but they don't care if a foreign culture displaces [native citizens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzZ6--p01KM&t=10).

(**11**) Liberals lock the front door, wear a seatbelt, put a leash on a dog, or use a firewall for the internet. It's normal to think of security, but liberals want to open the border which allows in drug dealers, [sex traffickers](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Human-Trafficking-Soaring-in-Mexico-Rights-Groups-Warn--20171227-0025.html), MS-13 gang members, or Muslim extremists.

(**12**) Liberals want a minimum wage of $15 per hour, but illegals are taking jobs for ""[$5 to $6 an hour](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-06/californias-undocumented-workers-help-grow-economy-theres-cost)"" without paying [tax](https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/james-agresti/about-61-million-illegals-filed-taxes-us-many-didnt-pay-received-refunds).

(**13**) [Nancy Pelosi](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/15/pelosi-slams-company-bonuses-as-crumbs-despite-once-praising-40-tax-cut.html) wrote that Obama's $40 tax cut per paycheck was a ""victory"" that ""will make a difference."" But now she says $2,000 from Trump's tax cut would be ""crumbs"" that are ""pathetic"" and ""insignificant.""

(**14**) Bernie Sanders owns [3 houses](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2016/08/08/bernie-sanders-buys-a-summer-home-in-north-hero), made over [$2 million](https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-makes-one-million-dollars-second-straight-year-book-deals-992845) in 2 years, and paid only [4% to charity](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/15/sanders-gave-4-percent-income-to-charity-in-2014-tax-returns-show.html) in 2014. If Bernie wants a tax cut, then liberals will endorse it. But if Trump wants a tax cut, then liberals will [reject it in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctz_dHfYfb8&t=24).

(**15**) ""Over 37 percent of House Democrats have practiced school choice, but [96 percent of Democrats](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/congressmen_love_private_school_for_their_kids_) who practiced school choice voted against the voucher program.""

(**16**) Pelosi didn't want to read a [few thousand pages of Obamacare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-05TLiiLU), but Democrats wanted to read a [million documents](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/20/democrat-demand-documents-kavanaugh-obstruction) before Kavanaugh was voted in.

(**17**) Liberals in the #MeToo movement are against sexual harassment, but Hollywood liberals were [cheering for Roman Polanski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXnNOBj26lk&t=49) who raped a 13-year-old girl.

(**18**) Liberals want [girls to join](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/02/boy-scouts-scouts-bsa-girls-joining-cub-scouts/572036002) the Boy Scouts and get [free condoms](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2603273.stm). But liberal feminists wanted [only women](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4546284) at a Wonder Woman screening.

(**19**) [Liberal feminists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZHuFah0uds&t=38) want to break the ""glass ceiling,"" but they become silent when [Muslims oppress women](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3844392). Democrats won't even talk with a reformist who said, ""They completely [ignored us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi8tV9J7Vgo&t=10).""

(**20**) Liberals say illegals will do all the dirty work, but then they say we'll need a universal basic income because of [AI robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-JR2KDRnEY) in the [future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aPPXB7gqYU). So which is it? Import more workers or prepare for mass unemployment?

(**21**) Liberals say that Facebook is a private company that can ban anyone, but then they say a private bakery should be forced to write on a cake for a gay couple.

(**22**) Zuckerberg built a [6-foot-tall wall](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3665223) and picks up [dog poop](http://metro.co.uk/2018/04/03/pictures-mark-zuckerberg-didnt-want-see-7436124).

(**23**) Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey protests the [redistribution of his wealth](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6298961).

(**24**) Michael Moore praised [communist Cuba](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article1928212.html), but during his divorce it was revealed that he owned [9 homes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2705149).

(**25**) Obama said, ""There's only [so big a house](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/barack-obama-on-wealth-inequality-only-so-much-you-can-eat.html) you can have."" But the Obamas bought an [$8.1 million mansion](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/news/g2535/obama-new-house-photos) and may own [5 homes](https://dailycaller.com/2016/11/20/the-obamas-just-bought-a-fifth-house-and-this-one-is-really-far-from-home).

(**26**) Democrat Julia Salazar portrayed her family background as poor, but her brother said they grew up in a ""[beautiful neighborhood](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/julia-salazar-brother-mother-question-claims.html).""

(**27**) Liberals are against the [gentrification](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5106811) of urban areas. They don't want old buildings to get renovated with new shops because it would be ""unfair"" to push residents out. The reality is that **rich liberals** have been pushing away **poor liberals** for years by increasing the cost of rent. Democrats block the building of [low-income housing in California](https://sf.curbed.com/2018/1/8/16863362). Democrat Bill de Blasio wouldn't talk with a [homeless woman in New York](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6246457).

(**28**) Liberals want illegals to flow in and vote Democrat, but liberals won't talk about solutions to stabilize the 3rd World. Birth rates decline naturally the richer a nation gets, but liberals don't want to industrialize other countries because of climate change. [Obama said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlgMwxcsOOE) poor Africans can't have cars or air conditioners. Meanwhile rich liberals like [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9xFFyUOpXo&t=7) use a sports car, [private jet](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3044176), or yacht.

&nbsp;

Liberals think we can smile, hold hands, and *live happily ever after* in a socialist utopia. The reality is that [naive liberals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u4Vlgr2iHs&t=8) support more taxes, regulations, and identity politics.",bsmith76,e93v4rc,The_Donald

I have been in meeting where he looks in the eyes of hardworking people and tells them one thing and then goes to Washington and doesnt do a damn thing or does the opposite. He is such a no show and liar that many associations stopped even trying to speak with him. For example, we tried working with him on fixing the Okeechobee problem 12 years ago!

For years, these dems have complained that voting was too difficult for many people, so they got their way and special means of voting was made, such as mail-in/absentee/etc. Then, dems complained voting on one single day was too difficult for people, so they got their way and early voting was implemented.

"MSM: ""Watch Trump **lie** seven times in one tweet."" 

1. @AndrewGillum is a twitter handle, not a real person. Trump's insinuation that a twitter account served as Tallahassee Mayor is obviously false. Rated: Pants-on-Fire!!

2. @AndrewGillum is a twitter handle, not a real person. Trump appears to be under the impression that a twitter account is running for Governor of Florida. Rated: Utterly-Insane. 

3. Andrew Gillum is **not** the current Governor of Florida, so Trump's statements as to how Florida would fare under Governor Andrew Gillum have no basis in fact. Rated: Pants-on-Fire!!

4. Trump's tweet implies that Florida is currently crime-free. Rated: Pants-on-Fire!!

5. Trump's tweet suggest that a Governor Gillum has *any* power to raise taxes on Floridians. Although the Governor can sign or veto tax bills passed by the legislature, the Governor *obviously* cannot pass legislation on his or her own. Rated: Pants-on-Super-Fire!!

6. Trump states that Ron DeSantis would be a ""great Governor"" despite the fact that he simply has *no way* of knowing the future. Rated: Pants-on-Super-Duper-Fire!!!!!

7. Trump implies that Andrew Gillum would do the ""same job"" as Florida Governor as Gillum performed as Tallahassee Mayor. This is an obvious lie, as these are two completely different roles, and cannot be held by the same person (under the Constitution). Not only does this demonstrate that Trump *clearly* doesn't understand the difference between a Mayor and a Governor, it *clearly* demonstrates that Trump has no problem violating the Constitution.

"This is it!!! Tomorrow we storm the polls and let Washington know what direction we want this country to go in.
This is a very crucial time in American History. We have two choices: You either vote hard left, or you vote to preserve American values.

The O'Keefe videos have pulled the curtains away. Every Dem in a Trump State is going to undermine his agenda any chance they get, and they will show their true nature once elected. Don't fall for the lies.

Send a message to these liars. Either run an honest campaign, or you get voted the fuck out!

I've never been this excited about an election. We win this one, and GEOTUS can start getting even MORE good things done for this nation. The alternative is more investigations without probable cause, impeachment, reversal of our tax cuts, higher crime rates, and nothing done about our border.

"REMINDER:

---------------------
**NEVER, EVER VOTE FOR A MUSLIM CANDIDATE.**

This is how it started in Europe and they are trying to do the same here. 

In the U.S. right now:

* Muslims want to *normalize* themselves as candidates, so it won't seem unusual to see their names on ballots.

* They can be stopped by **outing them for what they are and what they represent.**

* EVERY candidate, Muslim or not, must be PUBLICLY confronted and asked where they stand on Sharia law.

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia, which abolishes the first amendment and freedom of speech?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia, which abolishes equal justice under the law?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia law, which allows wife-beating?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Mohammed's advise to use deception when dealing with non-Muslims? Yes or no?""

* ""What is the highest law in the United States? Is it *your* Sharia or *our* Constitution?""

*Hang Sharia and Mohammed around the neck of EACH and EVERY Muslim candidate.* Make Sharia a constant political issue.


Yes, the Muslims will lie. Doesn't matter because **the goal is to educate every voter who is watching and listening.** 

-----------------------
**WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE MUST NEVER HAPPEN HERE.**

[Dr. Bill Warner explains this further.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP3C8mUVQgA) Educate yourself. Educate others. TELL EVERYONE.

"Sharia is not something separate from Islam, it is Islam. Sharia is the Koran and the ahadith and the sira compiled and codified. A Muslim can no more reject Sharia than he can the Koran and the sunna:

""And we have sent down upon you, the book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the book and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what allah has sent down and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you we prescribed a law *(shir'atan)* and a method."" Koran 5:48

The word ""sharia"" isn't the Koran AFAIK, it's derived from *shir'ah.*

Muslims often say one thing around non-Muslims and something entirely different when they're around other Muslims. They know this pacifies the *dhimmis.* He got away with telling you he ""rejects Sharia law"" because you didn't know what Sharia was (and most non-Muslims don't).

"In 2016, I started going to a gym and hired a personal trainer. As part of my new diet, I was told I needed to drastically cut back on salt intake. Since I was a kid, I loved salt; soy sauce was mana to the taste. My family joked I would be preserved like a mummy when I die due to all the salt in my body.

After a few months of training, I passed out at work. Paramedics came and drove me to the hospital. After a few tests, the doctor stated that I passed out due to a salt *deficiency*. I explained I was trying to cut back and how much I cut back. He then said that my craving for salt was my body's way of telling me I needed more salt than the average person.

"Just to step in here and explain why we don't have compulsory voting in the USA. Not so much to you, but to anyone in general reading this.

In America, voting is a right that every adult citizen has here in this nation. (There are some exceptions but it's true in general) Rights are not things forced on you, then they would be responsibilities. A person may choose to ignore this right as that is what makes it theirs. 

If you want to participate in the democratic process to select representatives for government you can, but if you want to not do that you can as well. Similarly you can choose to either buy a gun or not buy a gun. Gun ownership is a right but not required. 

Compulsory voting seems like a fine idea at first as you have a much higher % of the population that are interested in politics and governance, at least that's the theory. But then voting is not something you, a citizen, owns. It's a required task forced upon you by the government. 

And if you don't own the right, then it follows that the right is just a loaned privilege and could be taken away later, if the need is great. But here in the US, the right to vote is something the government cannot take away or even think about doing that, because they don't own it. Also our federal government doesn't even run voting, our states do. 

Voting is a local affair and each state can decide how it wants to vote. In theory a given state could require compulsory voting but unless there is a constitutional amendment the federal government never could, because they don't own voting. They are simply told what the results are as power flows from the people through the constitution to the government and not the other way around.

It may sound like a small distinction since, in the end, people vote and government changes in both systems but in the Australian system government engagement is much higher. However, in America, when turnout is high (as I suspect will be the case Tuesday), it will because Americans choose to have their voice heard since they have the freedom to do that.

Also those that choose not to vote are simply saying they trust their neighbors to make the right choice. Be it be fellow citizens of the state, congressional district, county, city, or neighborhood home owners association. A non vote is letting the majority of your neighbors decided which is a perfectly valid choice in my opinion.",still-at-work,e93l12p,The_Donald

"Well, with any form of communication, you analyze the audience, and you analyze the way to reach that audience.

When posting on reddit, the vast majority of the time you're not really communicating with the person you click ""reply"" to, you're communicating with those who come afterwards to read it.

With that in mind, if you determine that the person you're responding to is not going to be persuaded under any circumstances, you're free to respond directly to the readers who come after. Of course, this is not the only method - you can try to respond and persuade the parent, but it's time consuming and invariably you end up with an audience of one person.

And playing to the broader audience is a lot more fun - you can use tools like sarcasm and biting wit to draw out the flaws in the parent post by taking their argument to a logical end (or at least to the next step.) This usually angers the audience and prompts them to defend why they believe your response does not follow - but if you've done it correctly, they will realize that the (usually circular) path the parent post has put them on leads back to a flawed premise, and at that point you've given them the tools necessary to see through the lie for themselves. It's always more effective when someone discovers the truth themselves than when they are explicitly shown the truth.

"That's one answer but the reality is that the US can't take all migrants. There are over 7 billion people on the planet and the majority would probably like to move to the US. Do we want the US to have 1 billion in population? 2 billion? I grew up when the US had half the population it does now. It was great. Now, traffic has gotten much worse, the National Parks are overcrowded, housing/medical care/college are extremely high. Social capital has degraded a lot in many places and people are constantly anxious. Read Robert Putnam's study regarding diversity. Having massive population growth is a fool's errand and the Ponzi scheme of Social Security needs to be private accounts like Chile has.

The vast majority of these Latin American migrants are welfare dependent. Due to their cultural traits, they are forming a large underclass in the US. They have high dropout rates, high illegitimacy rates, high welfare use, high crime rates although not as bad as blacks. In California, hispanics commit 50% of homicides and rapes. California used to have the best K-12 school system, now it's at the bottom, not because of money issues, but because of changing demographics. Studies have proven that hispanic immigrants' children do a little better than  their parents but, by the next generation, they use more welfare. We have our own example of hispanic run America, it's called Puerto Rico. A place that, due to its corruption and high crime rate, was called Welfare Island by the Economist.

Excessive welfare use is why the majority of developed countries have a merit based immigration system. You can't have a sustainable welfare system and open borders. Immigrants need to be able to pay for themselves and their dependents. 51% of immigrant headed households in the US use some form of welfare compared to 30% of native born households. This shows we are letting in too many takers. 

So the short answer of they should get in line, too, is wrong. The answer is that we have enough unskilled 3rd world welfare parasites and we don't need more. There is NO line for them. It's also far cheaper to help them in their own countries. The countries they come from have plenty of wealthy kleptocrats that should be ""persuaded"" to share the wealth and invest in education and infrastructure. Why the elites in the West ignore this and promote 3rd world immigration is treasonous.",Acid_Howl,e93onvg,The_Donald

Its users construct their own characters and mash the keyboard to complete a series of missions and defeat an endless series of villains‚ÄîAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama‚Äîwhile advancing toward the end goal of rescuing the princess, Donald Trump, held hostage by the ‚Äúdeep state.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs speeches, rallies, and tweets function as cut scenes that ground the action, explain the plot, and establish new quests for players to complete.

"Reminder: 

During Obama's campaigns, the media gushed over this as Obama taking **bold new steps** in modern electioneering; tapping into the youth vote and bypassing 19th century canvassing by taking advantage of hip, new, ""transformative, game-changing""  social media technologies that ""leveraged the power of friendship"".

https://i.imgur.com/yoUpULQ.jpg

http://archive.is/grlwo

>The significance of the fusion of Facebook and voter file data is hard to overemphasise. ""This is the Moneyball moment for politics,"" says Sam Graham-Felsen, Obama's chief blogger in 2008. ""If you can figure out how to leverage the power of friendship, that opens up incredible possibilities.""

>Teddy Goff, the digital director of the re-election team, told Social Media Week that as the year progresses there would be more and more ""persuasion through interaction"".

>Goff said the campaign was focused on building relationships through social media. An Obama message would be crafted so that ""not only can it be passed to your friends but to those friends that we think are most in need of passing it on to"".",weltallic,e946fj0,The_Donald

"I see a large problem with the climate debate, that I am suspicious is the case for other people placed in the climate DENIER camp:


The Left are pushing hard that climate change is settled science, that ""literally"" all scientists agree and we need to act now, together. 


I agree action needs to be taken, but there are problems;


1. My first and major problem is that the debate has turned political, and therefore became a slinging match. We need open, transparent, non political debate and discourse into the problem and the solutions. Not by talking heads and celebrities, by people qualified to do so. 



2. The only solutions presented by the left are inherently anti capitalist and would violate the nation state, of which the right is vehemently opposed to. We need to think of and try solutions in the public domain, for instance Bill Gate's new investment initiative which appears to be a great idea.



3. Previous attempts seemed fundamentally flawed and almost corrupt, such as the Paris Climate Agreement, of which much I assume you know the finer details. If Western governments were so concerned with climate change why did they create a scam solution that didn't help anything?


4. Missing nuance and intellectual integrity, for instance there is strong evidence that we used to be slightly carbon starved, and now at around 400 ppm we are in a carbon sweet spot where crop yields are optimized and forests can recuperate. However we need to prevent it going too much higher >800 ppm to avoid danger. 


I do believe that man made pollution has accelerated climate ""change"", but for these reasons above apparently I am a backwards climate denier, for wanting in depth, research, debate and solutions outside of the political realm. How absolutely dare I....  I reckon there are many people at this position of distrust.

"Part of the issue with Republicans answering is the person on the other end could be any affiliation. While Independent and Republicans are much more accepting of other political beliefs, even if they disagree, much less people on the left are. So even moderate and right leaning independent voters are less likely to respond. 

It is also the biggest drive in pushing people away from the left and Democratic party. Regular straight line Democratic voters aren't as common as they were a couple years ago and it's a progressive change. That is one key reason why so much money has been pumped in ads for ""vote all blue"" etc. Also there isn't much of a unified platform other than ""Not Republican"".

I have seen signs that say ""Free Healthcare, Free Education"" Others ""Party of peace and sanity"" etc. Yet the local politicians aren't even running under these messages. They want you to vote because the other side is the boogieman. Which historically isn't a long term platform. 

Also why you see such a desperate drive for new voters, the heavy bleeding of Democratic voters. Too bad it has actually backfired.

"Polls can and do correct for their D oversampling bias. Knowing the breakdown of polling answers of each group, it's easy to adjust to the corrected numbers knowing the actual party breakdown in America. 

The issue comes about with the Independents and polling not being able to correct for their answers. According to Gallup's latest poll, 48% of Independent pollsters say they lean Democratic, while only 40% say they lean Republican. But we know that Trump won the actual Independent vote handily. And then the approval rating polls came and he had a miserably low approval rating among Independents.

"It's the wrong analogy in my opinion. I don't disagree that is what he said and did prior to the 2016 election, what I disagree with is the concept of probability when discussing predictions of elections. 

While at first glance, it may seem that, ignoring third parties for a second, ever voter is a 50/50 chance of being red or blue. But that is not how people work. They are not even weighted 75/25, they are not in superposition of both states and then collapse down in the ballot box. 

A voter has made up their minds for the issues and candidates they care about well before they enter the booth. There are a few jokers who decide then and there but their randomness should cancel out over a large enough population.

So the % of probability is really of the accuracy of the prediction. He is saying he is 70% sure Hillary would win. Yes that's not as bad as 100% wrong but it's still very wrong. Polling is about gauging the temperament and inclination of the potential voter base. So as to guess the outcome of where the majority will fall. 

Nate Silver's polling data was flawed and while his analysis of that data was correct but his ability to filter out bad data was not very successful. So he came to the wrong conclusion. 

Trump didn't have a 30% of winning, he had 100% chance of winning, we just didn't know that at the time. Outside of an invasion or major natural disaster, nothing that would happen on that Tuesday would change the outcome. Why didn't we know that Trump  would win? Because polling data in 2016 was very flawed and created a false picture of reality, something very few people grasped at the time.

What Nate Silver did do right was start to suspect his data was flawed, but not enough to avoid being very wrong in 2016.

But you know who did figure it out? The Trump campaign's own internal polling. Their predictions were dead on.",still-at-work,e93n4o3,The_Donald

"I'm a Research and Development Chemist, so while polling and stats aren't really my expertise, part of my job is to dig into raw data and see how people are reaching their conclusions, and quite often you can find significant problems within how that data was collected or interpreted. I did some in-depth calculations based on any poll that was brave enough to post their R-D-I splits back when Trump's first approval rating polls were coming out. The ABC/WaPo poll was notorious for oversampling Dems, but at least attempted to correct for it based off of Trump approval %'s within each party.

Yes, you're absolutely right that polls are easily skewed to get an answer that the people paying for the study want. Yes, there's probably some people who don't admit to voting Republican who still do. It's also very likely that the polls themselves drastically skew the outcome of an election based on people who see the poll results and decide they need to go vote or decide that they don't. 

If you're interested in my latest endeavor, the [Fairleigh Dickinson poll that claimed that watching only Fox News was worse than watching no news at all](http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2012/confirmed/final.pdf) was a terrible poll that drew conclusions off of some very thin data. They polled 1,185 people, which is pretty low in terms of sample size. They looked into the average correct answers for people who were only exposed to 1 news network to draw their conclusions. But the problem was, 76% of their respondents said they watched Local TV news, which automatically means that the sample size of people who could only watch 1 cable news network was down to 285. 72% read the local paper, 62% watch the evening news, about half of people responded yes to watching CNN, Fox News, MSNBC or talk radio. There's also a significant number of people who watch no news at all. The average news sources consumed per respondent was somewhere around 5.

Using this logic, we can deduce that the amount of respondents who only consumed a particular news network may be a couple dozen at the most. Drawing averages off of a sample size that small is a terrible practice and simply isn't repeatable because 1 right or wrong answer could significantly impact the average.

Rasmussen adjusts results based on party identification to more closely align with likely voters, which is why their numbers are significantly higher in favor of Trump compared to other popular polls. Coincidentally, they were the closest poll on election day. Some others adjust for party ID (or at least claim they do), but without polls posting their R-D-I splits and the approval rating by party affiliation, it's impossible to tell.

I am saying his methodology is flawed.

He is basically saying I don't know what will happen because there is too much unaccounted for error. 

But that is really just failing to collect the right data and analyzing it. Since that randomness is not real, its mearly a construct of bad data. 

In reality there was no randomness just bad polling leading to wide swing in the model to predict the result. He can only give probabilities because his data set is flawed. He underestimated how flawed his data was since it was still bias towards a Clinton win. 

Remember the randomness is not real but simply a manifestation of how much error was in the data. His analysis show that the error was there but still had a underestimated how much error and how bad the error favored one side over the other. 

There were other data sets out there that showed this, It wasn't as if the data didn't exists, just it was not counted a more reliable then the majority of the data which pointed a different direction.

So my criticism is not that he predicted the wrong result, as you said he didn't predict anything, my criticism is that his error margins were not large enough to reflect how bad his data was in reality. Classifying that as probability makes mathematical sense but it doesn't mean anything in the real world since the 2016 election only happened once and people didn't make their choice randomly. 

It only shows how flawed his simulations were that they got it wrong more time then not.

">Blue Bell Ice Cream is made in Sylacauga, Alabama

Blue Bell Creameries is an American food company that manufactures ice cream. It was founded in 1907 in Brenham, Texas. Unfortunately the advertising I remember from the 90's was a lie. It claimed Blue Bell doesn't leave Texas. It appears they expanded in 1992 to Oaklahoma and in 1996 to Alabama. That said, It's simply not the same in Alabama. 

>While we don't have as much oil as Texas, we do have a good amount with three refineries located in Alabama or 10 minutes over the line into Mississippi.

That's fine, but you are basically saying it's okay to be the neglected step child. 

>Alabama is home to the black Belt, some of the richest and best farmland in the world.

At a minimum, Texas has 3 times more farmland. Can sustain more crops and can fit 5 Alabama's in the whole of Texas. In this case quantity over a marginally better quality land for farming is what I am going to prefer. 

 
>Our gun laws are better than yours. For example, we can not be disarmed by the presence of a sign as you can under your 30-06 law.

I would wager that while you may have a few redeeming qualities on gun laws, Texas gun laws are much greater and allows for quite a bit more freedom. I could be wrong on this one, but given Texas gun laws and stand your ground/castle laws, I would wager Texas is in the top tier in the country for gun laws. 

Alabama is nice and all, but it ain't no Texas and that's a fact. I can blow through Alabama in a couple of hours. It takes me damn near a full day to clear through Texas and that is driving at the highest posted speed limits in the country, 85 MPH. 

There is simply more freedom in Texas and that is where I am comfortable staying, especially after having traveled through all of the lower 48 states.

"one thing we have to be wary of, is that although most combat troops are conservative, a sizable amount of the top brass of the Bush/Obama era is leftist, and also many of the noncombat troops. There was also a strong concerted effort in the Obama administration to reduce morale by removing traditions, instituting social justice reforms etc. with the intent to reduce the amount of red blooded Americans willing to enlist and re-enlist 

The same thing happened in Venezuela. Chavez removed the Venezuelan top brass and replaced them with Cuban military. He then spent years pushing through marxist doctrine in the military until the current military is run by Cubans and filled with brainwashed troops who will follow their commands without regard to them going against their people

It can and will happen here if we allow them to do it. Venezuela is a very good example of what can occur. Venezuela was  a nation of poor European immigrants with a constitutional republic modeled after the US with a bicameral legislature and two-party electoral system. They opened up immigration to the third world in the 1960's and began instituting socialist policies to win over the new electorate. The two party system became a uniparty and began using its corrupt power to enrish themselves at expense of a crumbling european middle class and a huge imported poor immigrant class. Until Chavez grew from the eventual chaos and won the support of the people with his leftist populism. The similarities with the US are truly astonishing and we should all learn from it

"listen man, you are either heavily misinformed, influenced by propaganda, or are a troll. Its pretty frightening that someone could still believe what you just wrote

the policies of the Chavez regime are directly responsible for what occurred, despite having the largest boon in oil revenues in history (10x larger) due in part to the US wars in the ME. 

The Bush administration retreated from the Western hemisphere after the 2002 failed coup in Venezuela and their policy shift towards involvement in the War on Terror. 

The plight of Venezuela is directly the fault of the ruling Socialist party and the Cuban imperialism behind it. I don't know if you are actually interested in learning why, so I won't write a lengthy response. But if you actually care to know, I'm more than willing to when I have some time.

It was long over prior to D-Day.

"I guarantee you I am not a troll, just a well researched person who is curious about other perspectives. 

This is where I get lost, I think the policies of the Chavez regime are not to blame for what occurred. I would actually make the argument that the policies were well thought out, the problem is when Maduro came to power. 

The subsidies were successful as was handing the means of production to the worker, unfortunately Maduro completely mishandled everything once he came into power. Let's take a look at the black markets that popped up after 2003. Chavez was smart enough to devalue local currencies when the black markets started to pop. Devaluing local currencies allowed black market goods to be at value with regular goods, effectively stomping out the black market. Policies like these ensured that growth and prosperity was possible.

I'm not saying Chavez was the best leader or anything, I'm simply making the argument that things are typically shades of grey. There's a lot that we can learn from Venezuela and the implementation of policies. Specifically, when we look at the way that those policies kept food and other goods affordable for the poor because they were proven to be an effective way to regulate the market.

It‚Äôs legitimate when they win and ‚Äúhorrifying‚Äù if anyone questions it yet some of them assume it‚Äôs illegitimate when and if Republicans win.

I think a lot of people on the left have trouble believing how many people actually support the president.  To many people it‚Äôs a foregone conclusion that he‚Äôs completely evil and they have a hard time swallowing the idea that so many people are OK with it.

Maybe that‚Äôs just my impression of the types of voices I see on r/redacted and not representative of most Democrats.  Personally I think most people are good and that both Democrats and Republicans want what‚Äôs best for this country.  We all just have different ideas about how to get there and that‚Äôs OK. 

I consider the push/pull cycle of the two-party system as another layer of checks and balances on government.  Conservatives try to protect society from the unintended consequences and hubris of idealism that can lead to the errors of the future.

Liberals and progressives seemed focused on correcting society from the perceived errors of the past.

I like to think of it like were all riding along in a big bus called America. Liberals are stepping on the gas as hard as they can to keep us moving forward and pushing us over the big inclines.  Conservatives are in charge of the brakes so we don‚Äôt get out of control when the twists, turns and steep downhills present themselves.

"At one point this may have been true.  There is no common ground between progressives and conservatives at this point and time.  If you think progress is the inevitable implementation of a socialist state, then yah, I can see where you can have some sort of belief in where the progressives want to take us.  If you think the highest good the Government can perform is the preservation of individual liberty, then the Conservatives are your best bet for the future you want.

&#x200B;

If you want to preserve individual liberty?  No, the progressives want to go backwards.  Socialism, with it's fetish for 'the rule of experts' is a re-branding of feudalism with 'rule of intellectual right' vs 'divine right'.  There are plenty of examples of how socialism will fail and lead to authoritarianism.  Expert also seems to be equated with perfectly moral.  Again no.  Humans are going to be humans, as such, it's best to limit the excesses to which any politician or person given power can go.

&#x200B;

The other problem is that quite a few of those errors that progressives say they want to correct are entirely to useful to them as wedge issues to drive up their voter tallies.  They don't want to correct them, they want to use them as a cudgel.

I'm not one of those people that subscribes to the notion of ""don't use their tactics against them, or you become like them"".  I much rather would employ something similar to the ""One Plus One"" rule for escalation of force, which in law enforcement advocates for the officer to use one level of force greater than the level of resistance used by the subject.

"Yeah the analogy is of course overly simplistic like most analogies are.

The breakdown of the family is a great example of the unintended consequences of progressive goals and policies.  

I‚Äôve often agreed with you not just that this country may dissolve into smaller units someday but even that they should.  The larger a Society becomes the less important the individual becomes unless it has a homogenous borderline libertarian mindset. 

California for example is really two entirely different states in terms of culture,beliefs and demographics.  Splitting us in two would be a much better way to continue the American experiment than keeping us as one.  It would give us the ability to see the results of disparate policies applied to each state so that we could better judge what works best for the common man.

"Yep. Back in 2016 when Scott Adams was playing the part of John the Baptist and preparing the way for our redeemer he mostly talked about persuasion. He felt that Trump is one of the best persuaders he had ever seen before but also talked about how the Democrats were evolving and slowly learning to counter.  Sometimes they do very well on certain issues but it feels like more often they just use brute force media messaging.

Judging by many of the headlines the last two years it‚Äôs clear that they‚Äôd rather just try to tell us *what to think* over and over and over.  I think a lot of people don‚Äôt have any resistance to that type of onslaught in their mind so they become NPC‚Äôs.

I think academia works the same way. They just keep repeating the same shit year after year to these college students until they simply submit and accept that this is just *the way it is* because that‚Äôs what the authorities told them and give up on the idea of trying to maintain an independent Spartan opinion.

"Ok :)  When i was reading I (obviously) had a few issues with where your analogy went.  

Totally agree no the states rights thing!  If progressives were content with just keeping their policies in their states then I'd be happy to let CA, IL, etc have their little socialist labs.  Though I'd also be happier if the people that voted that stuff in didn't flee to other states to escape the results that those policies could be predicted to create and then vote for the same shit in their  new home.

If I didn't have some concerns about what a split would lead to (China basically getting huge chunks of CA because we know when the newly independent country of CA goes to far into the money hole they are going to start selling land and everything else to China), I'd be happier with the idea of a split.  If for nothing else the ability to relax and not dread looking at the news headlines to see what new insanity the Progs are cooking up to inflict on all of us today!

They believed that our current society and culture are the central impediment to our ascendancy as a species and that removing all tradition is the only way that we could be equal.  In my opinion that mindset is basically just ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs destroy society to fix it.‚Äù  The problem is they‚Äôre blind to what is working already and think everything needs to be scrapped.

Tradition sometimes gets things wrong but I believe that‚Äôs the exception by a large margin.  It takes centuries to develop a tradition and it‚Äôs almost always kept around for it‚Äôs function.  It‚Äôs hard to argue with what has worked in the past to keep a society functioning well but there‚Äôs so many hysterical people that think we‚Äôre on the edge of a cliff at all times.

However, the change needs to actually make sense and not just because screaming children, with no idea of how the world actually works or have any experience with the rest of the world, want it.

"Just to educate my fellow pedes, socialism is when the government seizes private property and makes it property of the state.  Internet socialists don‚Äôt understand that when they advocate for socialized medicine, they are really advocating for the government to seize your healthcare options and the hospitals.  All private hospitals will be made into public hospitals.  That includes your small town doctors.  These idiots like to say that public roads and public schooling are examples of socialism, but they are completely wrong.  The government didn‚Äôt seize those things from private property owners, they created them.

The real socialists, the ones that actually know what they are talking about, have intentionally confused the meaning of the word socialism to help convince the useful idiots to help them.  The idiots hear ‚Äúfree college‚Äù and simply think that the government is just going to start giving people money for college.  They don‚Äôt realize that part of the plan has to be to nationalize all of the universities, otherwise costs would go way too high.  The real socialists know that what the idiots are talking about are simple subsidies, and that they would lead to disaster, but that they can use that disaster to convince the population to accept full socialism.  Why do you think Obamacare was passed?  It has been an unmitigated disaster that has sent prices skyrocketing upwards.  They knew that it would fail when they passed it.  Once it gets bad enough, people will cry out for the government to seize control of the hospitals to bring prices down.  ",Rifleshoot,e93ipsa,The_Donald

"I found this comment the other day. The subject was France then this guy began discussing Europe in general. It blew my mind and I'm already well aware of mass migration and Islamization. Longer read but worth it-

""Their desperation comes from their knowledge that the euro is soon going the way of the dodo and Trumps election has speed up the process to the point they cant contain it

Raising rates will first destroy the Italian financial world and subsequent most of the big euro banks, at this point poverty will be on the streets and the gibs to moderately placate the invaders will dry up

fun times ahead

further to the collection of Americans that have never been to Europe a few observations

the police and armies of almost all countries are completely castrated, the current governments do not possess the means to pacify even one big city in their respective countries, they rely solely on projection of strength, the first riots where the police are beaten back will result in total anarchy as people realize they can get away with anything, their own plans count on almost total desertion amongst general police departments after 1 week of sustained unrest

you are not going to abandon your family to guard the palaces of the rich when they don't even pay you anymore

there is no possible chance of balkanisation, the invaders are clustered in ghettos in large cities and are totally unproductive living on government assistance, they cant hold any territory. further all the invaders are also complete numales who live in heated government paid for apartments who have no idea of surviving without sleeping in their own beds, burning some defenseless cars for a few hours does not a rambo make

maybe the caliphate of Marseille will rise for a few months but the importance of the harbour means that it will be shelled into subsmission

also when the troubles begin there will be no effective interventions american, russian or EU

the logistic problems of keeping the large cities supplied are not to be fixed, no army could secure that large a population and feed it

also only one boomer has to be capture by nationalist forces to permanently prevent any foreign intervention, MAD does not work against a rebellion without any clear cities to bomb.""",GLOMPFFH_IS_FINISHED,e93sjg8,The_Donald

"It's not that they aren't bright. Europeans are quite intelligent and ""educated"" (in what they are allowed to know) and good and bright actually.  Reality is that WE did this to a large extent. We blanketed Europe in propaganda of collective guilting and shaming and degradation of whites and installed puppet governments and pushed what we thought was a moderate form of socialism ... aka, democratic socialism ... that we could control after WWII.  And all that collective guilting and shaming and empowerment of communism and socialism following WWII even allowed it to fester in the USA, which resulted in the 60s, fueled by the soviets throwing propaganda gasoline on the fire at the same time. 

Even up until recently and even today still to a lesser degree, Germany and Germans in particular have been relentlessly guilted and psychologically berated several generations after WWII ... which was a DICTATORSHIP ... that you didn't just somehow stand up and say ... I really don't want to take part in this ... because you would be dead; and that has caused MASSIVE psychosis and mental derangements in all of Europe, but mostly Germany's relationship to their identity and culture. 

It's really nothing different than a (mostly) woman that is/was in an abusive relationship where here abuser not only fucked with her mind and made her feel like shit and degraded her and made her feel like everything is her fault and all of the problems were because she didn't try hard enough and he beats her only because he loves her ... that level of fucked up ... and then she tries to leave and everyone around her is just constantly berating her for how damaged she is and how low self-esteem she has and how fucked up she is after years of abuse. It would fuck her up, just the same way that Germans and Europeans are fucked up. 

Then, on top of that, layer on that we have been babying Europe for at least 60 years now by taking care of their security and protecting the international trade routes and letting them live off of us with generous trade deals meant to get them back on their feet; so now, so long after having lived in that fantasy world we created and enabled for them, they are like delicate little flowers that don't know how to protect themselves and don't even know how to reproduce anymore. 

It's unfortunate, but our ""help"" that all the liberals pushed, has really done nothing but made Europe weak and naive and feeble minded. They have been propagandized for 60+ years that ""we are all the same"" there is obviously no difference between Africans and whites once you look past reality (which even we now suffer from) ...... so of course they thrown open the gates to those people who are of course exactly the same as they are in temperament, civility, courtesy, and mindset.

"The Democrat party is in a fight for its life.

Several years back, the news started to spread, not by the mainstream media, but through secret back channels: ‚Äúwhat have the democrats done for us?‚Äù the people started to ask. In places and races predominantly held under democrat control. The question became a single statement, uttered by Trump, but sending shockwaves through the democrat party: ‚Äúwhat have you got to lose?‚Äù So minorities started to red pill left and right. They started opening their eyes and abandoning the democrat party.

What was the party to do? The old tactics: call them Uncle Tom or NAZI weren‚Äôt working. They had to come up with a new scheme to stay in power. So they turned their attention to illegal immigrants. There were already so many in the country, more than we suspected. The party knew that first time immigrants almost always vote democrat. The scheme was hatched and plans were laid. Either get illegal immigrants legalized or at least get them voting without the feds being able to track them. So states like California went all in, giving illegals voting rights locally with some ‚Äúooops, looks like some may have voted nationally...sorry‚Äù, while refusing to provide any dat to the feds and fighting against anything that might give away their numbers. At the same time they worked to set up a system to get as many illegals into the country as possible. Those illegals could potentially become legal or at least start voting.

This idea will spread to over democrat controlled states and if enough start to participate, it could break the system.

This is their last ditch effort to stay relevant and win back power. Don‚Äôt let them do it. The only way to avoid this is to **vote on Tuesday and vote for Republicans**. Give Trump the resources to close the border and kick illegals out and put an end to birthright citizenship.",SomeGuysCat,e93nm3u,The_Donald

Manipulating which angle of what story we hear, gone. Biased opinions outweighing any factual evidence, gone. Force feeding emotions for political gain, gone. 

What a joyous time to be alive during this new age of enlightenment where we can read Podesta's emails (we got your emails). We can see politicians suffer crippling epileptic seizures all while accusing their opposition of health issues. We can see the genetic sequences that were lied about to further a politicians career. We can finally see the eyes watching us. What a truly glorious time to be alive.",Friedumb,e941owi,The_Donald

Even though this data was out there the other polls kept doing D+4 to an absurd D+13 sampling. This is why Nate's polling system is so flawed and he hasn't adjusted for it.

It doesn't happen overnight. It's a slow, gradual, constant process that slowly grinds freedom of speech and freedom of expression into dust.

Simply supporting the sitting president (who has above a 50% approval rating) is grounds for social media account suspensions and bans. Hell, simply telling people *they don't have to vote democrat* resulted in said entire movement being nuked from Cuckbook altogether. 




This ad needs to be seen by Americans, and that is precisely why it is being censored so heavily. A wise man once told me ""The only reason to want censorship is because your own ideas suck"". This is exactly what is happening in our country today; globalist democrat sellouts know their ideas don't benefit American voters, so they are doing everything they can to silence their opposition.

Is that how it works? So does this mean that only Caucasian-looking illegal aliens who are also murderers should be deported? But dark-skinned illegal aliens who murder people should be allowed to stay?

And where does the ad mention race? It's targeting illegal alien criminals. Is the media then saying all non-whites are illegal alien criminals?

So do CNN and NBC believe that US citizens should never have the right to refuse criminals infiltrating the country as long as the criminals are just dark-skinned enough?

"It definitely depends on where you go to school, but Gen Z is significantly more conservative than most young generations usually seem to be. Might have a lot to do with the rise in alternate media and homeschooling.

I'm Gen Z myself, and all my friends are conservative. We love Trump because he doesn't hide behind some fancy ""sophisticated"" words (not that eloquence is a bad thing) and says exactly what he thinks when he wants it. He gets the job done and can't be fazed or bought by any outside source. We love that about him.

Also contributing to this would probably be youtube compilations. Some of the most viewed compilations (all the rage among kids and teens these days) are SJW cringe compilations, Antifa getting owned, etc We see the BS pretty early on so many of us know it when we see it later.

Even though so few of us have actual adult experience in the outside world beyond school and hanging out with friends, we see the doom and gloom of the world; after all, we were born and raised to know a world of frequent terrorism, violence, insanity, and corruption, and make no mistake, we know who's fault it is. Surprisingly, despite all of this, we don't feel down and dejected because of this sad state of affairs and rather have our eyes trained towards the future, where we can help rebuild this great nation and bring it back to the ""good ol' days.""

"‚ÄúWhen a country is evenly divided ideologically, it‚Äôs unavoidable that those who split the differences will get outsized power, because they are the ones who will ultimately decide elections. That‚Äôs why every general election that begins with ‚Äòsecuring the base‚Äô ends with the presidential candidates begging for support from centrists, independents, moderates, and the folks who really put the *asses* in masses: the Undecideds. 


Every four years after each presidential debate we are forced to listen to interviews with undecided voters who not only can‚Äôt see major differences between the political candidates (which, by that point in the campaign, means they‚Äôve not been paying attention), but who also think the reason we have presidential debates is to give tutorials on policy minutiae: ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt hear enough about what they would do about education.‚Äô ‚ÄòI wanted more specifics about what [So-and-so] would do for someone like me.‚Äô Meanwhile, back in their election headquarters the anchors nod along as if this reaction is damning of the candidates performances.‚Äù

"It‚Äôs pretty simple.

When a woman gets pregnant, she carries to term and delivers a *human baby.*

Many women take / use a variety of methods of birth control to avoid getting pregnant which leads to you *having a baby.*

Instead of either using multiple forms of contraception like condoms, pills, etc. or abstaining from sex completely (oh the horror of that!) women slut it up and get reckless; maybe they use contraception regularly and as directed, maybe not.

‚ÄúOh no, I‚Äôve become pregnant! I don‚Äôt know how this happened! We use a condom every 5th time we fuck and I take my birth control every other day...doesnt matter the package says daily! A child will ruin my life! I‚Äôm not married! Waaaahhhh....‚Äù

Suddenly, the woman‚Äôs rationalization hamster goes into overdrive.

Ah-HA! I‚Äôve got it! Said the hamster; a baby isn‚Äôt really a baby until whenever we want to decide it is convenient for it to be a baby....like when republicans are continuing democrat policies of separating them from their parents at the border. Those are babies. Not when they are growing inside their mother. ‚ÄúFoolish humans,‚Äù says the hamster.

No, no, no...this ‚Äúthing‚Äù growing inside this woman is merely part of her own body; it is merely a clump of cells and it is a woman right to do whatever she wants with her own body.

If we excise this meaningless clump of cells from the woman‚Äôs body, it‚Äôs just like getting her appendix removed; her body, her choice.

Seriously; look up ‚Äúwoman rationalization hamster‚Äù - it‚Äôs a huge part of female psychology.

Like how a 500-lb ham beast continues to pig out like a sow at buffets, McDs, binge drink, then whine & cry that she can‚Äôt find any good men.

This is no joke, or anything to just dismiss as inept, just look at how absolutely vicious andcdegenerate they are after the election with their constant assaults and censorship and attacks without any kind of restraint; you think that would just somehow get better if they had control over everything? 

They will be unleashing utter vengeful retribution the next time they get power, and unfortunately I don‚Äôt see them being totally vanquished and taken out. Unfortunately, the spirit of the savages taking over is and will still remain intact for a long time and will only get worse with ever more savages that are brought into the western civilized world.

This is not going to go well if DRASTIC measures are not taken .‚Ä¶ and I am not even sure those would be enough since the enemies, foreign and domestic now essentially control our society through ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù that our foreigners and foreign allied people in control of our whole societies. 

It really doesn‚Äôt matter that there are some exceptions to the rule of non-whites that don‚Äôt hate the western civilized world, reality is that they are exceptions andvrhe Eule is that most non-whites wantvto doninate and conquer the west and all whites as they continue their genocide that has been going on for decades now unabated right under our noses.

Reality is also that this situation is hundreds of times worse than anything the west has faced because it‚Äôs mentally ill witg suididal negative feedback loops of self hate only spurred on by outside parties that have control over our mind and self-esteem, telling us ‚Äúgo ahead, you‚Äôre worthless and should give me everything and all your money and you should kill your self‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and it looks like we may just do that.",Suitable_Hero,e937ot4,The_Donald

If there was ever a reason for a state of emergency and martial law to remove, at the very least, EVERY SINGLE ILLEGAL AND GREEN CARD HOLDER IMMEDIATELY, then that time was about 20 years ago. 

We have, tops 8 years, before some other globalist shill is put in place and there is no other patriot that has ""fuck you""-money on a federal, Presidential election level and is willing to spend it on that. There are inherent systemic handicaps even that drag us down once we are in this state that pretty much hamper any kind of real rectification of the situation within the system itself. What people don't realize is what you laid out ... and more though ... that the very system that was put in place was usurped in such a manner that without even realizing it, they took over the system devised to ensure American stability and perseverance, and will now invariably use that not only against us, but it will also work against being able to take back control. 

Reality is that it ALWAYS was about race, and we are going to find out that truth in a startling and shocking manner one day when the mask comes off and they expose themselves for what they really are, savage parasitic pestilence bent on taking over and overrunning the USA and the civilized world just like Rome was, but the difference being that instead of competent humans, it's savages taking over now through parasitism.

If women perform as well as men it should not be difficult for women to ""get such roles"".   

Reality is that we have crossed a psychological rubicon that has psychologically broken down the defenses of our culture and society. Let's be real here, this whole ""women's rights"" moment is not going to last ... it's utterly self-imposed cuckery and self-destructive self-harm that will only go on for as long as it is needed to conquer and dominate us. 

Are women really going to be fighting the civil war against the brown savages when the day comes? If anything women, especially, liberal white women will be responsible for putting up the legal and law enforcement frameworks to formalize and even more deeply entrench the only systematic racism that exists, ""affirmative action"" that is nothing but theft of those who created things by those who are the pillaging parasitic pests ... whites by non-whites.  It's objectively so and unfortunately we will see that reality come true, regardless of how that works out for either party. 

Reality is there will be no delusional multi-cultural kumbaya-land of hugs and equality and diversity. When it comes down to it, the mask will be torn off and whites will hear ""wait. What?

"Fair enough, but reality is that they were and still are Africans. I hate to say it because it is impermissible these days to point to the ever increasingly agitated and freaking out elephant standing in the middle of the room and say ""uuuuhhh, why is there an ever increasingly agitated elephant in the room? Have you ever seen what elephants do when they freak out?""

Reality is that if Africans could have done that, they would have joined to fight off the muslims who started the African slave trade by first enslaving Africans and then creating a market that other Africans then fed. And they would have also been smart enough to organize and fight for their freedom when they were slaves brought to the new world by \*\*hispanics\*\*. And they would have risen up during the civil war that was claimed was all about slavery even though it really wasn't. And they would have been able to form a single successful, be it town, city, county, state, or country ANYWHERE after they were freed.  

Instead we have literally not a single example of anything run by blacks that is successful in its own right without delusional liberals throwing money at them with mediocre results at the very best. 

I would want nothing more than for Africans and blacks to be successful, but propping up wild exceptions like the black republican running for Congress right now, does not belie the fact that putting black people in charge of anything in white societies and countries whites built is utterly inane and disrespectful and utterly dangerous and foolish for a whole host of reasons. 

Sure, go ahead an dismiss what I say as ""racist"", but reality of the matter is that no one can point to even a single successful thing created, let alone just run by blacks that is a success in its own right? There are ZERO successes out of any black community. Even the globalist free basing self- fellating Foreign Policy magazine published an article titled ""There Are No Successful Black Nations"" (just Duck it).  It was of course more ""it's racism... white people need to bend reality to make fantasy come true so we can make believe that our fantasy came true"" but it still is rather important that even the genocidal liberals that are hell bent on destroying whites and the civilized world are recognizing that simple fact.

"You need to stop seeing it in absolute terms, with your ""were atrocities committed"", nonsense. Reality is that it is nothing but poisonous to think that way because EVERYONE commits and committed atrocities all throughout human history. What is even more important is the history that is hidden, that, e.g., the Comanche were utterly brutal in how they slaughtered women and children of any kind, including other ""natives"". 

What we unfortunately never understood is that all this stuff we are facing right now with ""white people are evil"" and ""white racists"" is ALL enemy propaganda to frack, infiltrate, conquer, and dominate by psychological warfare because we have absolutely no defenses against it because our ""defenses"" are ALL geared towards scanning the horizon for planes and ships and subs.  Our only real defense we could have had, the CIA, has been utterly garbage for decades now and has been totally infiltrated by muslims and hispanics for a while now, with a huge surge coming as a consequence of 9/11, invading this, that, and the other place and then hiring ""native speakers"" to serve in intel.

Boy, has he proved me wrong. Stellar economic growth, tough foreign policy that puts American interests first, winning on trade deals, finally enforcing our immigration laws. But honestly, those are things I always expected from Republicans (was always disappointed)

Trump is special because he fearlessly stands up to the corporate-media-hollywood-academic social justice cabal, who have been yanking our culture ever further to the left for most of my life, and who are so used to bullying to get their way. These coastal elites really and truly believe they know so much better than you what is good for you. They claim to care about the poor and minorities, but in reality they have nothing but contempt for anyone who is not part of their elite, ivy league, Whole Foods world.

For all my life these people have been winning against decent people. For the first time I've ever seen, they are losing, in retreat, in fear. They're showing their true colors (though I wasn't one of the people who needed to see it to believe it). A cultural force more powerful than them is building. Trump is the leader but the force is bigger than him, and will be around long after he's gone, if we play our cards right. Decency, patriotism, family values, and national pride are cool again.

"They *don't* actually oppose the Trump administration's economic platform. That's the frustrating part. Put out an opinion survey of economists and the vast majority of them support further steps towards deregulation, lower corporate taxes, reforming labor law, etc. The only major disagreement is on trade; in every major fiscal and monetary policy the current GOP mainstream is aligned with academic economists' consensus, and the Trump administration has mostly toed the line on the GOP's economic platform. But I cannot name more than 3-5 academic economists that have endorsed this Trump administration on *any* taxation, legislative or regulatory issue - and I subscribe to all the major newspapers and magazines and I regularly read their opinion pages.

I think the main factor is, economists are in academia. And the vast majority of their day-to-day colleagues (including some of their spouses) are far-left social science academics. It's socially convenient for an economist to just go ""I think Trump's general econ policy is sensible, but I detest his immigration policies / trade policies / rhetoric on race and religion"" and just fall in with the overwhelmingly anti-Trump crowd in the rest of academia. It's, on the other hand, social suicide for an economist to actually stand up and say ""*despite* all my disagreements with Trump on other issues, I endorse his economic plan."" You get no friends by standing up for one part of Trump's platform, even if it is the part that you are most qualified to speak about. And I imagine the same dynamic exists for the many IR experts that previously espoused views similar to the Trump administration's policy on the Middle-East and Eastern Europe. Or the engineers/energy experts that should favor this administration's policy on coal and nuclear. Disappointingly few of them are speaking up in defense of Trump's policies, because the social repercussions are too huge.",MundaneNecessary1,e939k75,The_Donald

"Agreed. My state, Minnesota, has 2 Senate seats up for grabs (both currently dem) and 8 House seats (currently 5 dem, 3 rep). Plus the Governor (currently dem but not running for re-election). Best part is looking at the past and the current election Minnesota is turning from a deep blue state to a swing state.

&#x200B;

Minnesota is traditionally a blue state, in fact it's had the longest democratic streak for presidential elections in the US, with the past 10 presidential elections going to democrats. We haven't had our electoral college votes go to a republican since Nixon. But in 2016, Not only did Minnesota have the highest turnout of any state ( 74%) Hillary only won by 1.5% of the vote. Only the 1984 election had a closer margin.

&#x200B;

The split is basically urban and rural areas, with the metropolitan areas of Rochester, Duluth, and the Twin Cities going to democrats and greater Minnesota going to republicans. What makes it a close race is the fact that the population of the metro areas and the population of greater Minnesota are very close.

&#x200B;

Many in greater Minnesota (or at least the vast majority of people I know) are voting republican again. If nothing else to stop Keith Ellingson from being our attorney general. Others are voting republican because around here people look down on those who sling mud during elections and the only group throwing shit is the dems, everyones tired of only hearing shit and having no idea what the candidates platforms are. Either way I'm hoping greater Minnesota turns out in even greater numbers than before. If nothing else to remind the cities that we exist.",djashburnmsc,e92vgh0,The_Donald

"I consider myself a member of the religious right, so this answer may be biased by my own perspective:  

Many people in the Republican Party leadership are either Evangelicals or Catholics (or other conservative religious groups).  Why? Because these people are passionate about issues affected by religious views:  Abortion and Religious freedom.  So, the nominees in Kansas are often, also, members of the religious right.

When you get out into the rural areas of the State (and even rank-and-file people in larger communities), I think the attitudes lean a bit more libertarian:  ""Don't tax us too much; don't regulate us; keep your hands off our guns; but fund our schools and maintain our roads appropriately.""  Polls have shown that most Kansas, including Republicans aren't as pro-life as many people active in the party.

So, what happens is that the Democrats do a really good job of portraying Kansas Republicans as ""Right Wing Nut jobs"" who want to violate the constitution with regards to abortion and who want to underfund schools.  School funding is a real big issue in our state, because a huge portion of the state budget goes towards school funding and our (liberal) State Supreme court has battled with the State legislature over the issue.  The Dems do a good job of controlling the debate on that issue; at least when they attempt to do what they are doing this year; tell the public that they will fully fund schools without raising taxes.

"The flag pole set was $130 at Lowe‚Äôs and it came with a quality American flag that the stars are embroidered and contrast stitching around the outside of the flag. To install you dig about 26‚Äù deep, put a layer of gravel and sand, then the sleeve that the flag pole fits into and put 100 pounds of concrete. All the supplies together was about $150. 

Bad news, about two months after install we had some storms roll through and snapped the flag pole in half. The pole is in five 5‚Äô sections. I ordered a replacement flag pole set on amazon for $60 and it came with a very poor quality, screen printed flag. 

I now check the forecast every day and if the wind is going to be 20+ mph I‚Äôll remove the flag and if there are chances of tornados I‚Äôll remove the flag pole completely and put it in my garage. ",mmos35,e92hj20,The_Donald

Trudeau loses to any conservative candidate, with the conservatives gaining a solid or super-majority.

So far, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba have all gone blue.  Quebec and Ontario are big ones, they're proportionally the two provinces that make or break a majority government.

In 2006 it was showing a 1932 level massacre in favor of Dems and it turned out to be a wave but nothing close to historic levels.

"> it's the easiest way to screen thousands of people very quickly. They send them through customs manned by the Secret Service. The rallies are free because you're already paying for them...

Doubtful they'd use customs for that purpose, since the thousands of people at each rally would severely impact the normal flow through customs. The Secret Service just sends a crew ahead to secure the area, setup queues, security checkpoints with metal detectors, tables for purse checks, etc, which leapfrogs to a future rally site afterwards to do the same.

"\>It's barely even conservative, it's just a party that doesn't want their entire nation bred out by mass foreign invasion. 



This is what Leftists (in the USA, anyway) consider ""far right."" Any deviation from 100% compliance with all aspects of the Leftist Agenda = ""far right."" 




This is also why we see them ""eating their own""/""tossing under the bus"" so frequently. It is difficult (even for the willingly indoctrinated) to maintain perfect compliance with the ever-changing narratives, buzzword invention, and lists of what is considered ""offensive"" to the Easily Offended. This is especially tricky considering how often Leftists go off on an improvised stream-of-consciousness rant in public and/or live TV (and also taking into account that any statement made in the past, any activity or association with people who are now out of favor, or a ""problematic"" choice of clothing/costume/hobby/food item are all grounds for shunning and placement on the ""nazi list"" if these transgressions are discovered, no matter how long ago the ""offense"" occurred nor the context of the situation historically or otherwise.     




Interesting example of the Leftist Purity Test: US Mainstream Media (""news,"" TV shows, movies) in general is extremely Left-biased, openly and deliberately. Coverage of Our President (and anyone who supports him) is consistently negative, and even those caught in the act of perfectly normal deeds of Patriotism and American Tradition are criticized. 




However: The Left is so spoiled for pandering at this point that **any** smidgen of dissent is seen as unreasonably harsh opposition that justifies physical retaliation. Fox News is often slandered as ""the mouthpiece of the Far Right"" and accused of being Our President's personal PR firm. In reality, Fox News is truly ""Fair and Balanced"" as their former slogan stated. They employ anchors/commentators like Sheepard Smith, Juan Williams, and other Leftists/RINOs/never-Trumpers who are just as Left-biased as anyone on CNN/MSNBC etc. Tucker Carlson's show frequently has guests from the most radical Leftist Fringe, and he allows them much more freedom to speak than a Conservative guest is allowed on most other MSM ""news"" outlets.

It most certainly is. If someone is objectively underperforming, we replace them. Or at the very least, remove them from exasperating the problem.

You are going to have to give examples. The departments of the federal government that actually contribute positively to society are few and far between.

The EPA? How is it that the EPA has been in existence for the entire time the climate debate has been ongoing, yet somehow things are always at their catastrophic worst? Is it the EPA that keeps you from burning lead batteries, or is it your own knowledge of what that will do?

The FDA? Plenty of useless health products are sold every day, the FDA doesn‚Äôt prevent that. Enough money and the FDA will endorse just about anything. Remember, jolly ranchers and Taco Bell are ok in the FDA book. We have a diabetes epidemic and an opiate epidemic, both have happened under the FDA watch.

Please explain to me how they are vital to society.  Not to mention, constitutional in general. 

> So it wasn't meant to serve the people's interests?

Where in the Constition does it say ‚Äúto serve the people‚Äôs interests?‚Äù

> It wasn't meant to engage in foreign policy on their behalf?

That would be national defense, and it doesn‚Äôt take a large government to do as such.  Next. 

> It wasn't meant to delegate resources in times of emergency?

An argument could be made that such an activity would be allowed through the general welfare clause, but no, that isn‚Äôt explicitly mentioned. 

> It wasn't meant to engage in federal law enforcement?

Absofuckinglutely not. It was explicitly established to avoid federal law enforcement. See the 10th amendment. 

> And I'm saying that's utterly ridiculous to want a successful country, but also a government that only engages in those things.

Thats not entirely true.  Before Blizzcon, Blizzard tried to hype sales by indicating they had something big to announce for Diablo fans.  Then like 2 days beforehand (after the Blizzcon tickets were sold) they tried walking it back some.  People weren't exactly expecting D4 at that point, but were expecting something for PC since, to this point, Diablo has been primarily a PC dominated game.  Then, at Blizzcon, the Diablo mobile game was revealed as the opening finale which is usually reserved for really big reveals.  So they revealed a mobile based re-skin developed by a Chinese company to a bunch of thirsty PC gamers as the big reveal.  

Once the disappointment from the initial shock had died down somewhat, a person asked if the game was going to be made available for PC (again, a somewhat normal question given the overwhelmingly PC dominated crowd) and their response was, I shit you not,:

"Fair enough, but let's talk it a step further. Nate Silver has no fucking idea who's going to win and he's hedging his predictions.",JediMasterGandalf,e942r3u,The_Donald
"Hold on. 

4/5 cannot be as common as 1/5. Thats exactly what probabilities ARE. You can't say, something is 4/5 likely, then say theres a 50/50 chance that its 4/5. All you're doing is labeling one side ""4/5"" and giving it a probability of 50%.

OP is exactly right, he's hedging his bets and not sticking to what he is predicting. Otherwise he would say Republicans are only 1/5....period.",MAGAManARFARF,e9435py,The_Donald
"He's smart bc he never loses. The reason for that is that his model doesn't make predictions just probabilities and he can always say that the not probable thing happened.

He said Trump had a ~78% chance of losing in 2016 but the ~22% thing happened. It's not that rare for a 1 in 5 to happen. He never went all Huffington Post  on us. Think about it as having 4 blue balls and 1 red ball in box. The odds of pulling out the lone red ball is only 1 in 5 but it can happen.",Cangeorge,e9448ua,The_Donald
"He didn't say it was 50/50. That was my point, he was taken out of context. He said that the possibility of the R's or D's getting the House is very possible, not that they both have a 50/50 chance. 1/5 is a good chance too, just not as good as 4/5.

I think the mistake people make with him is that they think he's reliable, kidding aside though, he's not a pollster. He only inputs other people's information in to his algorithm. If the polls are bad then his probabilities will also be bad. He comes across as if he's hedging but he's not really hedging on a red or blue wave but rather on the information being fed to him being accurate. A pollster that has D's at +10 who then says the R's might win is full of s**t, but that's not Silver's job.

I'm not sticking up for him as being reliable as I think he's partisan who was fed internals by the Obama campaign in 2012. In this instance though he was taken out of context and it makes us look stupid.

No shit, there's two parties.",MAGAManARFARF,e945d2i,The_Donald
"You're missing my (the) point. 

Nate has to pick. Is it 4/5 to 1/5 odds? Or is is something else?

You can't say its 4/5 to 1/5, as a ""reputable pollster"", then in the next breath say ""but anything could happen.""

""Anything could happen"" is a given, we all know that, so backing off from that essentially makes your 4/5 to 1/5 completely worthless.",MAGAManARFARF,e94577z,The_Donald
I agree. I'm no fan of his personally or his system. Just don't want us to look like fools. I always though that metrology is the best profession for a talentless person if you can get a job there.

"I apologize but I think you're missing my point. He's not a pollster. He takes other people's polls, inputs it into an algorithm, and then he puts it in to probabilities of different occurrences happening. So he's not hedging the polls bc he doesn't poll at all.",Cangeorge,e946eqh,The_Donald
"No, he makes predictions. But he doesnt support his own predictions.",MAGAManARFARF,e9479rl,The_Donald
"We're playing word games here. 
He doesn't make predictions in the sense of a final outcome. He makes predictions on the probability of a final outcome.

You and I both agree that his business model is a sleazy way of ensuring that he's never wrong, bc he can always say the less probable thing happened and voila! It's all good and he can continue on to the next election as the undisputed master. 

The reason why this scam works for him is bc he's not a pollster and so you'll never hear from him that D's or R's will end up with these final numbers. Larry Sabbato used to be the best prognosticator until 2016 where he failed miserably and he questions himself to this day bc he actually is a pollster with predictions and when they don't happen you question your methods, if you have integrity. If you don't have integrity others question you.

Silver won't have these issues precisely bc he doesn't predict final numbers nor does he poll.

"It shouldn't be and isn't a we vs. they issue, because blanket statements are blanket statements. All kinds of people cross lines. I've seen stuff on T\_D which disappointed me and people here laugh at it cause it's a hot meme. The takeaway from Crenshaw's little video here, isn't that it wasn't funny or distasteful, it's that he was man enough to not even give a shit. Some times people make jokes in poor taste (some like SNL do it a lot, but they're just not funny) I just don't think it's right that every Norm McDonald, or Aziz (who I fucking hate lol), or just regular joe on twitter, right, left, or whatever, has to be fearful when they do. It's killing free speech and comedy.

&#x200B;

To reiterate, I hate SNL, and don't think what they said was funny, but I don't think the act of poking fun or ribbing a veteran is in poor taste. I joke with my mentally challenged  neighbour and thats because he always says he wants to be like any other person, and I rib all my friends. ""Nice haircut man! Where's the soup bowl!"" kind of thing. But I know they will rib me right back, and I know the people to know something like that won't hurt them and they know it's a joke. Look at what T\_D does to McCain lol. No one should be off limits for a joke (its sort of like what South Park saw with the Mohammed stuff), but there should be a respectable line, the trouble is, figuring out that line is incredibly hard.

"This is why they have been LYING about President Trump & his supporters since day one.

Constantly misquoting his comments about illegal immigration at the border ""DRUMPF said ALL Mexicans..."" üôÑ

Pretending he refused to condemn the KKK & David Duke, despite him disavowing them over & over again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoXThCb8EZA

Pretending he called nazis ""very fine people"" despite him explicitly denouncing them in the same conversation & ruling them out of that description: http://magaimg.net/img/6n5o.jpg

>Trump: You had some very fine people on both sides...**I'm NOT TALKING ABOUT NEO-NAZIS & WHITE NATIONALISTS, THEY SHOULD BE CONDEMNED TOTALLY**

>Media: TRUMP SAID NAZIS ARE FINE PEOPLE

Trying to pin the ethnonationalist wing of the ""Alt-Right"" on him & claiming he never disavowed them, even though he has done so explicitly: http://archive.is/2LnPx#selection-379.1-379.60

>Trump denied Tuesday that he did anything to ""energize"" the alt-right movement...
>""I don't want to energize the group, and **I disavow the group**"" 

They simply PRETEND not to know about the above, and the many times he's said something like ""**Racism is Evil**"", e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzNPXkpWObA

If they had ""forgotten"" the many times he's denounced hate, he reminded them again with a passionate speech condemning anti-Semitism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuiOOdPQ9M

>This evil, anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us. It is an assault on humanity. It must be confronted and condemned everywhere it rears its ugly head. **We must stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti-Semitism and vanquish the forces of hate. Those seeking their destruction, we will seek their destruction.**

Even AFTER witnessing that speech, they have the audacity to accuse him of ""dog-whistling"" to anti-Semites.

And they ignore the many, many times he called for racial unity, including in his beautiful inaugural address, which they called a ""dark vision for America"":

>**Through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.**

>A new **national pride will** stir ourselves, lift our sights and **HEAL OUR DIVISIONS**

>It‚Äôs time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that **WHETHER WE ARE BLACK OR BROWN OR WHITE, WE ALL BLEED THE SAME RED BLOOD OF PATRIOTS**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRBsJNdK1t0&t=14m43s

-----

**This is patriotic American Nationalism. By embracing our identity as AMERICANS, rejecting the dividers who insist we see each other primarily through a racial lens, & working together to defend our common values, we can MAGA for ALL.**

**When We the People embrace each other, the Republic WINS & Democrats LOSE.**

#MAKE AMERICA UNITED AGAIN

"LOL the ""Morrissey is a big pharma stooge"" is one of the most blatant propagandized pushes from the left I have ever seen!

Sorry you got bamboozled by the left, but the work Morrissey did with pharma was perfectly in the right, had NOTHING to do with opiates or pushing addictive substances, was not during the time of any pharma crisis, did not start any kind of pharma crisis, and he recused himself from the case where the Republicans in his AG office sued the *former* pharma group he worked with on unrelated stuff (they won and got $20+ million to combat drug addiction in WV) but while he was recused he was very OPEN about how to win that case and why it had to be done.  He's done more for combatting drugs and addictions than ANY previous AG in WV history, and has worked on it on the international stage as well, and championed/co-authored many laws about it that have passed in WV and have been proposed elsewhere, like the anti-pharma-retribution law that makes it illegal for companies to punish clinics that refuse to push their pills.

Contrast that with Manchin whose wife and daughter are both CURRENTLY pharma lobbyists representing those companies pushing those pills and whose other daughter is the VP of MYLAN who got a FAKE DEGREE from WVU and a QUID-PRO-QUO job to bilk the nation on the EPI-PEN scandal!

It's all PROJECTION.

You have NOTHING to be ashamed of with your vote for Morrissey!

Meth in the border states is more likely to come from Mexico.  In WV, as pointed out that's as local as you're gonna see.

The path for that shit is China.

The ports are so busy that even if they bust a $100m(street value), it's a drop in the bucket.  Port traffic is just that busy, stupidly busy at that.

Heroin is much more interesting in it's path, Mexico is right, but they're big buyers in ""chinese white"" these days which is far more potent then a lot of the other stuff.  It's also on the illicit market about 40-60% less then say what comes out of Afghanistan.  Funny thing, is  you remember all those problems China was having with muslims?

"Its not for release,  but we are seeing James down just outside the margin of error.    This race will come down to who actually shows up to vote, which is hard to predict.  Enthusiasm seems incredibly high based on the phone calls and emails for signs, and the lack of Stabenow signs sure seems to convey that we have more people excited, but not much we can do if the conservatives don't go out.     Midterms are normally light voting in the heavy blue areas here,  but this might not be a normal election cycle.  

The close race is from the same polling firm that we used 2 years ago that was showing Clinton and trump in a dead heat 2 days out from the election when most polls had her at +5 to +6. Trump ended up winning with less than a 1% edge. 

Polls are never 100%,  but private polling tends to error in favor of quality over quantity.  

In the last week 3 polls have been made public showing Stabenow with +17, +13, and +7.   This is not even close to what we are seeing internally.

They never acknowledge why their families came here from Britain/Germany/Ireland/etc because that would mean acknowledging the opportunity here. Of note, these purebreds are usually the only ones who can hear these dogwhistles I keep hearing about... 

Sadly, there are still people of color who are disgusted with interracial marriage. (There‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúso you think you‚Äôre too good for your own kind?‚Äù in certain communities.) There are still white people who are against interracial marriage. And even as recently as the 90s, there were still parents who canceled play dates after they met my mother, a woman of color. My parents car was egged, windows broken, and the word ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù written in red paint on the rear window when I was six and my parents were in town for a wedding in Tennessee. My dad was called a ‚Äún****r-lover.‚Äù

As a result, I don‚Äôt disown my heritage, but I really prefer not to bring up my background. But some folks want to bring it up at every turn.

Running a no-name against Trump seems even mode sad than running Hillary again. With that said, keep reminding the masses that Bill Clinton is a rapist, Hillary Clinton actively silenced his victims, and that people who have incriminating information about them tend to commit suicide with 2 shots to the back of the head.

Trump v. Hillary was a rare case of both being extremely high-profile, where even non-political people had heard of both. That's not the norm.

"Speak the truth brother. I'm over these sealed indictments and stealth sessions bullshit. If it turns out he's actually doing shit behind the scenes and brings the hammer down, I will eat my words and admit I was wrong. Trump wants to save America and bring traitors to Justice. I truly believe that, and I know it in my heart God chose him to save the county, and the world as a result. But people are out to stop him bringing these monsters to Justice, and the swamp is deeper than we can imagine. People will hamstring him and stab him in the back at every opportunity, and will lie, cheat, steal, and decieve Trump at every turn. Sessions, I believe, was compromised, be it threats against his family, or something from his past. He is not doing his job. Maybe I'm expecting shit to happen to quickly, and they are setting up for a massive purge all at one time. This is possible. But I don't think that's what Sessions is doing. The Keebler elf is asleep at the wheel, and needs to be replaced. I hope I'm wrong, and we have been making progress this entire time. But it doesn't seem to be that way with social media trying to sway the election with all the interference, banning of conservatives, refusing to run ads for Republicans, and a number of other things. I hope there is an operation unfolding that we aren't privy to, but if there is, they are doing a fantastic job to make it seem like nothing is being done. I trust noone but the president, he has earned that trust. Sessions has not. Pence has not either, even though people here seem to love him.

"One would think.. Until the American people find out Barak Obama was a manchurian candidate designed to allow Valerie Jarret to run the US for Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. If actually released to normies in a digestible narrative... The nation may never recover.

Saudi rival to throne funds c student non naturalized citizen Obama's Ivy League Harvard education in cash. Obama groomed by Communist Frank Marshall Davis and Leftist terrorist Bill Ayers. Valerie Jarret grows up n is radicalized in Iran, made a deep cover agent. Introduces young "" community organizer "" Barry Soetoro into the VERY POWERFUL Chicago political machine of Richard Daley. Makes and pays for all the needed connections.

It is known Barry is homosexual. For optics he is introduced to transvestite Michelle Obama, encouraged to start relationship with and marry. A suitable couple is found to have two children as a ""beard"" for Barry and Michael. This Obama nanny, is CONSTANTLY around the kids, also her and her husband are a dead on match for Sasha and Malia genetic material.

 This arranged gay/transvestite marriage/non citizen is in actuality blackmail. It will be used to threaten and control Barry should he ever grow a consience or decide to go off script. The power elite only DEAL with you if your willing to be blackmailed, they only TRUST you when you molest a child..

So Mr.Harvard Junior senator has his Saudi financial backers get him the finest speech writers, use their fortune and media contacts for a HUGE Oprah appearance, the media contacts get told to push the "" Our Next President "" tag line. They use their  Chicago political machine to run a hugely successful slogan and campaign.

Meanwhile.. in the background. Muslim Brotherhood and Islamic Iranian fundamentalist Valerie Jarret watches it all unfold with a smile. Once in the Whitehouse, she is named advisor. People and Millitary aides watch her with a close eye. Obama WILL NOT attend a meeting without her present. When she was left out of any meeting or briefing because she did not have the proper clearance, its said that she would pitch such a shit fit untill Obama convinced others to let her attend, that one could be forgiven for thinking that "" SHE WAS THE PRESIDENT "".

A TOP SECRET DRONE WITH ALL THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY LANDED PERFECTLY UNHARMED "" ACCIDENTALLY "" IN THE MIDDLE OF IRAN. JUST AT A TIME WHEN THEY WERE HURTING FOR AN ADVANCED GUIDANCE SYSTEM FOR THEIR ICBM PROGRAM.

A CIA TRAINED ASSET NAMED EDWARD SNOWDEN BECOMES A CONTRACTOR FOR THE NSA. OBAMA KNOWS THAT THE US MILITARY IS WATCHING HIM LIKE A HAWK, HE FIRES GENERALS LEFT AND RIGHT, FILLS THE DOJ AND JOINT CHIEFS WITH AS MANY FRIENDLY FACES AS HE CAN. YET STILL , THEIR ARE GOOD MEN WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

SINCE THE WHOLE BIRTH CERTIFICATE FIASCO, THE NSA QUIETLY TOOK A DEEPER LOOK AT THIS BARRY SOETORO GUY.. THEY WERE WORRIED AT WHAT THEY FOUND OUT, HOW DID WE NOT SEE THIS BEFORE.. WAS JOHN MCCAIN IN ON THIS?? WAS HE DESIGNED TO RUN AND LOSE TO PUT THIS GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE?? 

WHO IS THIS WOMAN MAKING ALL THE CALLS? WHY DIDN'T WE FIND OUT SHE WAS RAISED IN IRAN. SHE HAS STATED THAT "" HER SOLE MISSION IS TO BRING THE IDEALS OF ISLAM, TO THE US"". THAT SHE MAY HAVE CONTACTS WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, SAUDI ARABIA, AND IRAN?? HOW DID ONE OF OUR NEWEST AND TOP SECRET DRONES LAND IN THE MIDDLE OF IRAN UNSCATHED?  WHY WOULD A US PRESIDENT BE SO OPENLY HOSTILE TO ISRAEL?

WHY THE HELL IS HE SIGNING THIS GOD AWFUL NUCLEAR ""DEAL"" THAT WILL ALLOW A CORRUPT IRANIAN REGIME TO GAIN PRESTIGE, MONEY, TIME FOR WEAPONS RESEARCH, RELIEF FROM CRIPPLING ENERGY AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.. BY THE TIME OBAMA WANTED TO RETURN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THE SHAH OF IRANS ASSETS FROZEN BY THE US BACK TO IRAN.. IN THE FORM OF HARD CURRENCY IN DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS AND CURRENCIES (HARDER TO TRACE) SHRINKWRAPPED ON PALLETS, AND FLOWN TO IRAN BY BRENNAN'S CIA IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT.. THOSE PATRIOT GENERALS IN THE NSA KNEW FOR SURE THAT AMERICA HAD A PROBLEM. OBAMA KNEW FOR SURE THAT HE WAS BEING WATCHED. HELL HIS SECRET SERVICE CODENAME WAS "" RENEGADE "".

THIS IS WHEN EDWARD SNOWDEN WAS ACTIVATED. HE WAS GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT TO COMMIT THE WORST LEAK OF CLASSIFIED DATA IN US HISTORY. THIS UNASSUMING LOW RANKING CONTRACTOR SOMEHOW GETS ACCESS TO EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO BLIND THE NSA EYES AND SIDETRACK THEM FOR YEARS TO COME. SNOWDEN IS CIA.

OBAMA SENDS THE CASH TO IRAN. (THE PLAN ALL ALONG) A SECOND PLANE IS THERE TO TAKE BARRY AND JARRETS PAYMENT OR ""CUT"" FOR THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF PLACING A DEEP COVER IRANIAN AND SAUDI MOLE IN THE WHITEHOUSE. THE NSA AND US MILITARY IS  FUMING..

 HOW DO THEY JUST COME OUT AN ANNOUNCE THIS WITHOUT THE CIA USING THEIR MEDIA TO SPIN AND COVER THIS AS AN ATTEMPTED COUP? HOW DO WE SAVE THE REPUBLIC FROM COLLAPSE IF WE LET EVERYONE KNOW?? WHAT TO DO? NOW THEY WANT TO KEEP POWER AND PUT AN EVEN WORSE CRIMINAL IN..NOW THEY ARE SPYING ON THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS WITH THE DOJ AND FBI! HOW DO WE SAVE THE REPUBLIC?

CUE ADMIRAL RODGERS. HE TELLS NO ONE. HE GOES TO TRUMP TOWER. IT IS REPORTED HE MAY HAVE TOLD TRUMP THAT OBAMA  HAD SPIES IN IT HIS CAMPAIGN AND THAT THE TOWER.  WAS BEING ILLEGALLY WIRETAPPED. THE NEXT DAY WITHOUT ANY NOTICE THE CAMPAIGN MOVES ITS HQ FROM TRUMP TOWER.

Dan Bongino has been like a wild dog going after this case, he deserves an immense amount of respect, gratitude and admiration from every single American (hell, everyone worldwide, if you're on the side of good and not evil).  Without him, Papadopoulos would've been relegated to the dustbin of history, an interesting mid-length wikipedia entry that could go either way in regards to fitting one's argument re: spygate/his innocence or guilt.

"They call it red pilling for a reason. Remember that scene? Neo had a choice, he could have taken the blue pill and everything would be hunky dory, could have lived a simple life coasting along.

For people who grew up in Texas, Florida, Virginia, or some other more moderate state the burden of going ""against the grain"" or not feeding into the liberal mindset is hard to relate. My life would be so much easier right now if i just shut my brain off and agreed, ""Yeah, drumpf is bad"".

My entire family is liberal, the only conservatives i can think of are some uncles i'm not in any way connected to. My friends are mostly all liberal, my coworkers in the tech industry were all liberal. Literally everyone that meant anything in my life was a leftist. Around the time of the Orlando shooting I started questioning my politics. When I told my brother ""Hey maybe Trump won't be so bad"" after the election he angrily said he wanted to punch me in the stomach. My Mom asked me if I was racist. Coworks started shunning me in the workplace for saying a similar thing.

What's shitty is i try to be professional. I don't go out of my way to be political in the workplace, but these leftist zealots do A B testing on people. They shout out ridiculous shit and take note of everyone who agrees with them, and who doesn't. ""God I hate having an idiot in the white house, does anyone else miss Obama?"". Or while you're grabbing coffee, ""Ugh, this country is turning into nazi Germany, what do you think about Rex Tillerson?"". They have this internal mental check for everyone in their lives. They MUST know if you are on their side. Disagree on a SINGLE bullet point and you get branded a nazi in their brain. I miss the days when people judged people not on the color of their political affiliation, but by the content of their character.

Then you become ""that guy"". You're the guy no one likes, you're the embodiment of all their sorrow and lost dreams. More or less a whipping boy for their democratic frustrations. They couldn't win the election, but they can make your life hell. And on this coast and in a techy office, you're either alone, or part of a very small marginalized minority.

My entire life has been shaken since the election. I don't feel comfortable getting jobs in tech any more after working my ass off and accumulating a lot of student debt. I grew up in California so i pay an insane amount of child support that barely allowed me to survive renting a single cheapest room i could find and working my ass off for several years. This is just icing on the cake for other shit that plagues this industry.

The rabid, unconditional hate for anyone outside of their bubble has had a negative toll on my life both personally, and professionally. And I can absolutely relate to your feeling of being drained. To top it off most single women are leftists and they WILL want to know where you stand on Trump, and i'm not willing to lie to get into someones pants.

So yeah, every single time i see a negative post, ""Drumpf is bad"" I see someone that would be willing to destroy my life and indirectly my children's' lives over the most bullshit of things. And that in turn makes me lose most all respect for them.

Everyone in my life is a liberal, too, minus a very small handful of co-workers I met over the past couple of years. On election night, in fact, my co-worker was a Trump supporter, and I seemed a bit confused as to why he was cackling as states were turning up Red like mad. Fast forward to now, and hoo boy, I see exactly why. But he is was just one out of, I dunno, maybe three, with one of them being a question mark all together. I've found that, when it comes to work, I just fall back on the age old excuse of, ""I am not going to talk about politics while I'm at work"", and I haven't gotten crucified for it yet.

"**Recalling the Oklahoma 'Dust Bowl' migration of the 1930s...** which was the **caravan of its day**, almost solely in the direction of California -- despite that the Okies leaving their homeland might have had much better success if they had scattered and sought refuge in neighboring states or land to the North -- there was deceitful hype by the press.  There was even a badly worded notice from a California paper placed there by a local farmer that said to effect, ""come one, come all"" hoping to fill a few dozen seasonal laborer positions... but that notice was picked up **(as Fake News!)** by countless of other papers in the Midwest and copied endlessly, creating the false impression that California itself was inviting *any number* of them.  So they squandered their effort to the single journey and found great hardship when they arrived as a destitute group.  

[cite](http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/reel_new/films/list/1_70_6) *""California was seen by numerous migrants as ‚Äúthe land of the new beginnings.‚Äù Many believed opportunities here would lead to a ‚Äúfresh, new start‚Äù into the ‚Äúgood life.‚Äù Because of this perception, the media blew California‚Äôs success out of proportion. Songs written at this time cried that ‚Äúwork [was] easy found‚Äù and that plentiful crops allowed families to ‚Äúeat and eat till [they were] full!‚Äù However, in reality, an abundance of work and food was not always found. Another way the media affected the Okie migration was through tourist advertisements. In order to attract tourists, marketers directed the publics‚Äô attention towards California‚Äôs charm. Their advertisement mainly focused on sunny climate, majestic landscapes, and, of course, Hollywood. Hollywood was associated with glamor, money, and success. By creating ads that appealed to the masses, Okies saw California as Heaven on Earth. The Okie migration did not take off because of the common misconception that the dust storms were the causation. Their migration occurred for a multitude of reasons.""*  

**So imagine... if a few misleading news items and a badly worded employment notice could take in so many people, what could a coordinated campaign and pre-paid debit cards do?**  We are experiencing the 'weaponization' of migrants.

"I realize that, but just look at the legal immigration numbers alone, they have sky rocketed since the end of Clinton going from about 190,000 per year which is already a whole city worth of people EVERY SINGLE YEAR until it has been inching ever closer to 1,000,000 per year just alone in naturalizations, not even to mention the 1,000,000 legal residency permits issued EVERY SINGLE YEAR on top of that. 

And realize they are overwhelmingly for Ondians and Latinos now, who reality simply is, are not going to lead to the USA continuing on as thei bring their communist/socialist mentalities and cultures to the USA. 

The rather deflating reality is that without DRASTIC measures being taken even way beyond what Trump is doing, the USA simply will not survive this to approaching zero degrees of likelihood. 

The elite think they are creating a new neo-aristocratic vision of fractured and polluted peasantry they can rule by divide and conquer, but reality is they are probably just going to cause a massive conflict and destroy the whole civilized world. Maybe that‚Äôs their plan all along, even as I suspect it‚Äôs not a plan at all even though they will surely take advantage of being able to cull the peasants since it is becoming ever more apparent that just as, e.g., the African population is expected to grow by roughly 40 Millions  EVERY SINGLE YEAR humans will become ever less useful to them as robotics and automation take over.

And George ""Retard"" Bush just continued the immigration rates. 

People really don't get that the trajectory is in no way you look at it good, regardless of whether we are able to feel good about winning a battle.

Because someone somewhere other than me must have realized by now that IF you assume that climate change and even just pollution in general is as devastating as it is claimed ... once you objectively look at things you find that there is only a single solution that has any effect whatsoever in the long run .... and that's population reduction by drastic amounts. 

Fact of the matter is that one way or another, whether accidental or unintentional or deliberately or systematically or actively  ... the population of humans on this planet needs to come down DRASTICALLY. Yet instead, even after decades of delusion about how if Africans just have their basic needs met they will stop reproducing like pests, they have done nothing of the sort and actually have increased their reproduction rates as you would expect when giving unlimited and unbounded resources to mice.  

There is no way around the fact that by the 2030s the African population is projected to increase by 20 Million EVERY SINGLE YEAR and by the 2040s it will increase by 60 Million EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

"Statistically, Republicans have better turnout when the weather is bad.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00565.x

*The relationship between bad weather and lower levels of voter turnout is widely espoused by media, political practitioners, and, perhaps, even political scientists. Yet, there is virtually no solid empirical evidence linking weather to voter participation. This paper provides an extensive test of the claim. We examine the effect of weather on voter turnout in 14 U.S. presidential elections. Using GIS interpolations, we employ meteorological data drawn from over 22,000 U.S. weather stations to provide election day estimates of rain and snow for each U.S. county. We find that, when compared to normal conditions, rain significantly reduces voter participation by a rate of just less than 1% per inch, while an inch of snowfall decreases turnout by almost .5%. Poor weather is also shown to benefit the Republican party's vote share. Indeed, the weather may have contributed to two Electoral College outcomes, the 1960 and 2000 presidential elections.*

"Of course the little twerp Pete Davidson is the one who's cracking the jokes, he wasn't funny on Guy Code and he definitely isn't funny on SNL. Anytime I see him attempting comedy he's the only one laughing at his own jokes.",YoureAWhiteMale118,e92bqlk,The_Donald
"My position is that the only real sin in comedy is not being funny. No subject should ever be considered completely off-limits for jokes as long as its:


A.) funny
B.) in the right context
C.) intellectually honest. 


So what pisses me off about SNL/Pete Davidson controversy is that they‚Äôd never take that kind of jab at, say, a black Democrat or any number of other possible targets. It would be far different if SNL was known as a true equal-opportunity offender a la South Park. But, no, in their infinite and entirely predictable leftist smugness they make a snide and low-effort jab at an objectively amazing dude because he‚Äôs a white conservative male and therefore doesn‚Äôt count as people. So it‚Äôs not only not funny, it isn‚Äôt even honest since they‚Äôd never direct the same type of jab at...let‚Äôs say, Alexandria Oscario-Cortez. Nope, that would be inappropriate. But a white, Texan, war hero GOP candidate? ‚ÄúFuck em lol.‚Äù

Contrast this with Family Guy. McFarlane is obviously a huge lib, but he doesn‚Äôt pull punches for ANYONE on that show. I hugely respect that. (He always gets away with jokes that no non-libera ever could.) McFarlane skewers everyone in the crudest and most demeaning ways possible, but it‚Äôs *honest* because he reserves no special kid gloves for any of his targets.

"Nah the instructors at BUD/S are awesome. Whether you make it or not, they still want you to succeed in life. I would certainly attribute many of my best character traits to the discipline and motivation it took to endure many days at BUD/S. I ended up getting performance dropped before 264's Hell Week for my run times.    
    
I have zero regrets. I was relatively fresh for that final 4mi run on Monday of the third week of 1st phase. I ate well the weekend prior, slept well, and felt I gave it my all, but I still couldn't make that 32min cutoff. Usually they roll a student to the next class, but I was already rolled from 263 for a separate issue. Ended up doing two Indocs, 2 1/2 weeks of 1st phase, passed the 50m underwater swim, and spent about 6 months down there as a white shirt.    
    
Even knowing I was about to get dropped I refused to ring that bell. I stayed with my boat crew for those extra few days and still put out, hoping maybe for a rare two-roll exception simply for my steadfast refusal to quit. Ended up helping my boat crew get secured early from night rock portage the evening before I was dropped, so I got to go out on a win of sorts :)    
    
I was just kidding about my earlier reply. My experience at BUD/S has been nothing but a positive impact on my life thus far. Well, except for the occasional nightmare in which I find myself back at BUD/S of course.    
    
Dead serious about that part too. Some of us BUD/S duds (we wear the term with pride) at my squadron called 'em, ""Returning to BUD/S dreams,"" and they're the fucking worst, lol",ack567,e92o2b4,The_Donald

"This continuing line of ""misinformed or under-informed Trump voters"" is complete crap.

My greatest takeaway from yesterday's Chattanooga rally (my first!) was how knowledgeable the people in line were about midterm issues and candidates/races nationwide.  I mean, I'm in Chattanooga chatting with all kinds of people about John James in Michigan, the closeness of the Nevada race, Tester in Montana, how Hugin might be a hold-your-nose candidate, but New Jersey HAD to reject Menendez.  These people were definitely NOT ""under-informed.""

This doesn't even take into account the chats I had about Merkel in Germany, Brazil's ""Trump"", Austria leaving the UN Migration Pact, the Chinese trade situation... Trump voters are NOT the zombie-like cult members the MSM likes to portray.  They seem to me to be some of the most informed people in the country.

"The real secret of these rallies are that think more people have probably seen this president in person then any other president in history. And those people tell friends and family about the event and how they saw the president wave at them. 

That doesn't seem like much but it resonates. The President of the United  States of America is the most powerful person in the world and him deciding to talk to you directly is an honor. Doesn't matter that you are there with thousands or that its basically the same speech he always gives at these stops, or that you can watch them all on YouTube. The fact is you can stand in line for 4 or more hours you too can see the most powerful person in the world speak to you personally about issues you care about. And it's free. 

I don't know if it will be enough to have a 'red wave' this Tuesday but I guarantee without these rallies the turnout would be much lower.

Based on early voter numbers (of which I count among their number) this will be the highest turnout in a midterm for 50+ years. And I very strongly believe that higher turnout favors the party in power when the nation is in an economic boom.",still-at-work,e92igow,The_Donald

My very based wife has a theory - that John James doesn't need a Trump rally to win. I know for a fact that Michigan was well-sampled by a firm that does internal polling for Republicans, namely TPC (they called me twice): https://www.targetpointconsulting.com/ourwork/

I believe he would be here if he thought it was necessary.

The yard sign count is well beyond 2016 and James signs outnumber Stabenow signs by at least 2:1. John did his own rally blitz and all his events were standing room only. Most telling are the last two polls on Real Clear Politics showing James suddenly dropping from a point outside the margin of error to about 10 points down. Nothing happened.

I agree Islam is incompatible by design with the West. But on the other hand Islam is a good check on excessive western progressiveness. So whenever Kavanaugh gets accused without evidence of rape, you can always count on Muslims to know even women can lie about being raped.",beatricejensen,e93yxnd,The_Donald
"What if they support Trump and are Republicans? There are plenty. Or a from a Muslim nation that has strong military ties to the US, like Qatar, Kuwait, or Jordan? Are they incompatible still?

">Trump hates terrorists, he‚Äôs never been anti-Muslim. 

I didn't say anything about Trump.

> You got this info from a meme and don‚Äôt really know what your taking about. 

I know exactly what I'm talking about because I'm an atheist, so my head is clear of bias against a particular religion and I pay attention to the fucking world.

An individual or small number of muslims may be Trump supporters. Sure. That's fine. 

But, as muslims increase as a % of any population - and that is even down to a neighborhood - they become more radical. As they become more radical, a larger % start advocating for all of the things that make muslim countries shitholes - like the things I mentioned above. 

There have already been studies that show that the 2nd generation is more prone to radicalizing as well.

Look - the things I mentioned - marrying 9 year olds - disrespect for women - those are *foundational* in the muslim faith.

Go look at the surveys of muslims in britain - look at the % that advocate for sharia for all - muslims and non muslims - look at the support for death to apostates - look at he % of ones that want speech critical of islam banned...

Islam is incompatible with western values, and we can see *right now* the results of mass muslim immigration to the west, including their higher birth rates.

So, take your ""you don't know what you're talking about"" and shove it up your fucking ass.

"Mass migration is a problem, no matter what faith the migrants follow. There are many Catholics like me in this caravan, and I still don‚Äôt want them to cross the border illegally. I‚Äôve lived, worked, and served in Muslim countries, and never ONCE seen a 9 year old as wife, and strict Sharia is definitely not imposed everywhere. As the other person mentioned, there are good and bad flavors, simple as that. ",acanto11b,e94488i,The_Donald
"It‚Äôs not about mass migration (although I agree that mass migration, diversity and multiculturalism are all bad as well)because it‚Äôs not about culture.

You guys aren‚Äôt getting this- Islam is not a culture. It is a religion. It‚Äôs a religion that has sacred accompanying texts. The rules in those texts- the foundation of the religion- are objectively bad. 

Islam didn‚Äôt go through an enlightenment like Christianity did. It is not the same.

I don‚Äôt care if you worked in predominantly Muslim countries. I know what the numbers show of the attitudes of Muslims *right here in the west already*.

And I see how those attitudes have their roots in the religion.

Again- this isn‚Äôt about culture. You grew up in the west, founded in judeo-Christian culture. *It is not the same as Islam*.",scarmine34,e945ab7,The_Donald

Here is my final point, and why I made my original comment: there are those on this sub, which I have been a part of since day 1, who think saying ‚Äúfuck Muslims‚Äù makes them patriots and more MAGA. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs you because you say you‚Äôve actually researched your claim, but it is something that I will push back against because of my experiences. It‚Äôs not what this movement is about, at all. ",acanto11b,e946kt5,The_Donald
"19% of United States Muslims believe suicide bombings are at least sometimes justified.

And, yes, the US is part of the west.

I understand and your point about people saying fuck Islam just because- and I also care about the optics of that to people outside of this sub.

But, I don‚Äôt care about your experiences. You say you don‚Äôt care about polls- but that‚Äôs a terrible way to look at the world- you are picking your subjective experience over objective facts.

Objectively, Islam breeds extremism because it is in the foundation. That doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt plenty, even the majority, of Muslims that are great.

It means that they will always be a problem population.",scarmine34,e947put,The_Donald

"My very based wife has a theory - that John James doesn't need a Trump rally to win. I know for a fact that Michigan was well-sampled by a firm that does internal polling for Republicans, namely TPC (they called me twice): https://www.targetpointconsulting.com/ourwork/

I believe he would be here if he thought it was necessary.

The yard sign count is well beyond 2016 and James signs outnumber Stabenow signs by at least 2:1. John did his own rally blitz and all his events were standing room only. Most telling are the last two polls on Real Clear Politics showing James suddenly dropping from a point outside the margin of error to about 10 points down. Nothing happened. There was no scandal, no October surprise. Both new polls are heavily skewed D and are purely propaganda. We have the energy, the motivation and the amazing candidate. We are going to win!

So they needed to tag him with a crime to justify that past tense FISA as well as get a scalp for Mueller to gaslight the American people and justify the Special Counsel.

"Your best bet for public information in a ""concise"" manner is to read Dan Bongino's *Spygate: The attempt to frame President Trump* (too lazy to check if that's the exact wording), and if you are more interested in diggin, review the Snowden releases and some of the Hillary emails. 

The Ryan with The Intercept did some decent pieces over the years https://theintercept.com/2018/03/01/nsa-global-surveillance-sigint-seniors/

But be  a bit weary of The Intercept, there have been some notable shifting over the years that indicates to me some deliberate direction probably by way of funding. For example; take one of the current front page stories lamenting how it's really tough to vote in Georgia elections if you only speak Spanish ..... O_O   These are people claiming to be preserving people's rights. 

As an aside, it's utterly bizarre how things have gone so sideways so fast in just the Obama administration. Sure, Bush royally fucked America up, but in a dumb as fuck retarded frat boy surrounded by retards LARPing as functioning humans type of way that is ultimately still fixable, but Obama just poison pilled America and the whole world in such a way that it has psychologically broken people's minds and especially spirits that is kind of irreparable no matter how long or hard you try.

Summary

Two Scoops refers to TIME magazine story that reported President Donald Trump's special dinner in which his chef brought one scoop of ice cream for each his guests but two scoops for the President. ""Two scoops"" quickly became a joke online as people mocked the president's two scoops as indicative of his apparent domineering personality, as well as the news media's coverage of his dessert.

"The Senate is a territorial body that represents the geographic interest of a state. This means each state gets 2 Senators x 50 states = 100 Senators.

The House is a population representation. There are 435 House seats that are roughly proportional to population.

This balances the interest of location versus population. Some areas are key zones with tons of resource extraction, but low population. Having a purely democratic body would under-represent  these regions.",fwipfwip,e922ufa,The_Donald
"We have 435 house members. All of them serve two year terms and are always up for re-election.

We have 100 senators. All of them serve six year terms. They are divided to have only 1/3 seats up for re-election every two years. So only 33 senate elections in 2010, 34 in 2012, and 33 in 2014 plus a few special elections if someone dies.

In 2018 there are 26 DEM senators for re-election and only 9 GOP senators for re-election. Only 2 or 3 GOP senate seats are at risk. OTOH a whopping 10 or 11 dem senate seats are at risk and in states that trump won in 2016.

"And just to throw in another fact totally unrelated to the midterm elections..........when there is a presidential election (every 4 years) the winner must have a majority of  270 electoral votes.
The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. A state‚Äôs entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.  This means 435+100 +3 (Washington DC gets 3 electoral votes)=538. This also shows how the largest states with the most representatives (and therefore electoral votes) carry so much weight during an election, and why middle America is often termed as Flyover states.

And if you voted for Trump in 2016, you approve of the direction that the country is head, you approve of Trump's job performance in general, and you're splitting your vote then I literally can't even process that as a logical thought.

If Congress is split then Trump's agenda for the next two years is dead in the water. He will only be able to act through executive order, and EOs are bad for business as a president because they will just be overturned by the next president.",IsNotARussianBot,e92fcsn,The_Donald

"I think the candidates were less ideologically fixed to their party platforms, and at least somewhat believed in the philosophy they were espousing, and weren‚Äôt afraid to disagree with the platform.

The dems this election cycle are either NPCs or area ‚Äúbosses‚Äù of the democratic party platform. 

So today, voting dem for senate and rep for, say, governor makes very little sense to me, and I don‚Äôt really believe it‚Äôs as common. It‚Äôs something that confounds me as a Texan because Abbot polls so much better than Cruz. 

Something else to think about, representatives don‚Äôt represent the whole state. Only the population in that representative‚Äôs district vote for that seat, which also explains why a dem may win a seat in a texan district. An example of this is Beto having been a congressional representative from a heavily democratic district, El Paso. 

That being said, if the majority of people are electing republican senators, it should stand to reason that the majority of voters would elect republican representatives as well. ",drunk-deriver,e932xv2,The_Donald

However, I have had plenty of core classes with serious leftist undertones, mainly English and Poli sci. 

One of my English professors was a self proclaimed feminist, so I did my final report on the PATRIOT act, the NSA and government surveillence. I gave a presentation over the sancitity of our Constitution and our god given rights and the responsibility today's society has in paying attention to how our intelligence agencies and new technologies are being used. 

This was before Trump started his campaign, so it was easier to talk about that kind of stuff without being labled partisan by angry NPC's. I got a good grade, but based on the discussion portion of my presentation, I think it still went over the heads of most in my class.

"" IM SO PROUD OF MY "" RAINBOW BOY "", LOOK REDDIT I'M SUCH A GOOD MOM, GIVE ME GOLD AND KARMA NOW PLEASE! WAIT.. YOU WHAT? OHH HE IS? OHH I SHOULD? THANKS FOR THE ADVICE ARMCHAIR DOCTORS AND MENTALLY ILL FOLKS! I JUST FOUND A DOCTOR WILLING TO PUMP HIM FULL IF ESTROGEN! CAN I HAVE MY REDDIT GOLD NOW? I'M SUCH A GOOD MOMMY!""

This is why I HATE single motherhood. I realize not all women, but goddamit you need a father around to prevent shit like this. Coincidentally, it's why ""THEY"" have worked so hard to destroy the family unit. Divorce is a win win situation for women. The community no longer shames slutty or cheating women. Things like Tinder, Match, Snap chat, Instagram, Facebook have begun the 3rd feminist sexual liberation intifada.


 Men are portrayed as bumbling idiots on EVERY TV show and movie. Estrogen mimicers are laced into every piece of plastic that our food comes into contact with. When women flush their birth control it enters the water supply ( cannot be removed ). Yellow food dye for over 290 different types of food has Tetrazine in it ( the making the frogs gay) thing is real. What do you think it's doing to your kids? Kraft macaroni and cheese, Mountain dew, Margarine, hostess cakes, sunny d, corn and potato chips, and literally anything with a yellow / orange hue in it.

No you WILL NOT see a father taking his child to a doctor to ask about gender re assignment. I am sorry but this is something WOMEN specifically do. Men WOULD NOT let their 8 year old boy dress up in drag, and spend a week unsupervised running around with his favorite drag queens from TV. Fully grown gay men unsupervised with little boys who idolize them! Yup, smart move mom, your so courageous!

My unpopular opinion. When you factor in just how many gay people were sexually molested as a child, how many sexual predators were molested themselves as a child, how many gay people are on depression medication, and commit suicide a year.. The Numbers are staggering. Being gay should be classified and treated as a mental disorder first, if given the all clear at an appropriate age, then fine go have a blast if you aren't a pedophile, suicidal, or depressed...

They try to say 10 percent of the population is gay.. I say that's bullshit. It's more like 5 percent if that.. Out of that population the percentage of depression and suicide is ALARMINGLY HIGH. Over 70 percent. So do NOT try and tell me that I am wrong for wanting to wait untill a child grows up and begins to experiment with his sexuality  before he decides he (sigh) "" is a woman "" or Gay..

G. If wanting gender re assignment, than be made absolutely sure it is who they are, and what they want. No regrets which could lead to depression and suicide.

I'm not talking about putting gays in camps. Just using a mental health based model. I think this could greatly benefit young confused kids, who may be experiencing weird feelings and experimenting sexually with friends of the same sex. To know that it's normal, it doesn't mean they are gay, and if it does than they aren't broken, and have nothing to be ashamed for. That it doesnt mean they are a woman in a mans body, or vice versa, and if they think it does mean that. Than a battery of psychological examinations should be done to ensure it is for the right reasons.. 

That's my Unpopular Opinion when I look at the mental health statistics. For such a tiny portion of the population to be so over represented in suicide and depression.. I think it's a cop out to blame it on all straight people, and say its because of bullying. When it could be a mental health problem for many.

Saying that everyone else must change for us! You have to be okay half naked men dancing in the street with massless chaps and angel wings, little boys pozzing themselves up and hanging out with trannies. Pumping children with hormones for normal children type behavior. Making 58 different gender pronouns and compelling speech. Forcing children to abandon basic biology in school because someone somewhere might kill themselves because the kids are being taught that biologically there is ONLY 2 genders...

This is all bullshit. If people want to be gay, be gay. If you want to cut your dick off and have an open wound that accumulates pubic hair and smeg, and pretend your a girl whatever.. Don't tell me MY child has to indulge you in your little fantasy or you might kill yourself. If you are that sensitive than there's something wrong upstairs anyway.

It sometimes takes some strength of will to stand up for this idea, but perhaps the words of Chesterton can help:

>After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.

I mean, there are people 1 generation in America and they are Americans now. Seems silly a person with 400+ years as farmers in the bush of South Africa and they have no credibility as an African? This is just US ignorance and maybe political correctness.

In South Africa if you were black you were a Black African, or just black. Every Black African I know in the US prefers to just be called Black as African seems to have negative connotation, though not necessarily, but in some cases.

The person responsible for many of the threats, law enforcement officials said, was half a world away, in Israel, a Jewish teenager.

" Honestly if you read this board - that shouldn't even be a question. Liberals believe that all races/cultures/sexes/cultures are equal. There exist no differences naturally. Where differences exist one group is cheating/racist/scheming/evil/ etc.

So Jews for example - only a blind man would not admit that Israel is a massively better place then Palestine. That despite not having oil Israel is a flat out better place to live then most of the Middle East.

Likewise Jews make more money, have better jobs, and such in the US as well. So this proves that the Jews are evil.

 Success is a crime. Relative success of a group can only come from oppression/rascism/slavery/explotation/lying/scheming.

The good news is this dogma leaves liberals powerless to make intelligent decisions. They can't decide to say keep out MS13 - because hey all groups are the same..They can't advocate merit based immigration. They can't see how lower taxes or the rule of law would help the economy.

lots of people hate themselves for whatever reason: previous mistakes, not being the fastest/strongest, maybe fucking up a job, not being pretty enough, or something. its human nature. Its essentially the concept of 'original sin'. everyone wishes they were better than they currently are or regrets something they've done in the past.

in the past, people could go to christ for forgiveness and get a new start on life. Like, through baptism or confession or whatever your particular flavor of christianity believes in. Jesus provides forgiveness and redemption.

with the rise of athieism, there is no method for people to be forgiven or redeemed. They are forced to suffer for their previous transgressions with no chance of a clean slate. They are forced to live with the weight of their sins pressing on them from now until forever, with no relief. not ever.

Is this why lefties are so adamant about white guilt? they have no outlet for being forgiven for their sins? is this why self-hate is a core component of all lefty ideologies? their lack of jesus and the forgiveness he offers causes them to seek out self-harming ideologies as a way of punishing themselves for their own sins?

&#x200B;

"I believe that does play a part, but I think the more common reason for liberal beliefs is a bit simpler. 

1) Indoctrination by schools and especially colleges - we are naturally predisposed to get to college and feel out of our element, like everyone (especially professors) might be smarter than us or at a minimum that it is a group of smarter people than we have encountered thus far in our lives. So when 100% of those professors are liberal, that has an impact. Especially if we have not actively practiced critical thinking on political issues throughout our lives and educated ourselves. Who fact-checks teachers and professors regularly (on non-political issues)? Pretty much nobody... The whole system is geared towards taking the word of the textbook and the professor, so we aren't even in an environment where skepticism is top of mind, even if we are a skeptical person in other aspects of life.

2) With the fall of religion came the fall of morality. We NEED morality in our lives as a guiding principle. Even many church goers frequently show up week after week because they want to appear to the congregation that they are good Christians (or Jews or Muslims or whatever). The good type that doesn't just show up at Christmas and Easter. But when you take away religion and mix in a little social media, you get a recipe for virtue signalling. People don't even have to leave their couch now to demonstrate their self-righteous morality to the world. They could go help at a homeless shelter, but then the only people who would know they did that (unless they take photos and post to social media) would be the people working at the homeless shelter (who would beat them in morality bc they work there full time), the homeless people (and we don't care what they think, bc their opinion of our morality doesn't earn us any status in society), and the other volunteers (who are our equals in terms of this morality we seek). So not only would going to serve at a homeless shelter require actual effort, it wouldn't even service our need to be viewed in society as an upstanding and moral citizen. Therefore, it is more effective and more easy to just proclaim on social media how moral we are.

3) Liberals are far less tolerant of alternative political views than conservatives. This is not an opinion, it has been scientifically proven. Conservatives shrug and still befriend the liberal, whereas the liberal likely cannot befriend the conservative due to their political beliefs. So if you want to fit in, you should lean left. Conservatives won't care and will continue to be your friend, and you also can now be friends with leftists. There have been studies showing that any organization not EXPLICITLY conservative will turn left over time - conservatives will usually be willing to hire liberals, but liberals won't be as likely to hire conservatives. So naturally, the population of the organization shifts left, and then increases it's leftism exponentially once a critical mass of liberals is reached within the organization. Society can be viewed similarly, especially large cities. If you're in a large city with a critical mass of liberals, the leftism grows exponentially and only the most hardcore conservatives stick to their guns, the rest just give in because their political views aren't worth quite literally ruining their lives and destroying all possibility of a friendship in the city where they live. Even a portion of the hardcore conservatives who stick to their guns will at a minimum not make public their feelings, so naturally you create these huge echo chambers where liberals literally believe every person around them holds their same beliefs.

Again, I believe that self-loathing can certainly play a part, and not having the self confidence and self esteem to be comfortable with who you are and what you believe will make it easier for you to ditch your conservative beliefs for liberal ones that will help you fit in better, but I think it's only a portion of the deadly cocktail that has created the current state of leftism in our country.",pedegear,e92edv2,The_Donald

"This is a brilliant suggestion, especially from my point of view as a devout Catholic.

The devil loves to twist what is good in us and turn it into something evil. In this case, the desire to overcome original sin and unite with God.  Liberals deny it exists then turn around and reconstruct a new version of it which applies only to their own race. Then when they go to redeem themselves, do they do so through self examination and self denial of the urges that would harm themselves and society?

No, the devil teaches that all things are permitted in their personal life, and that their path to redemption lies in advocating for a system of governance which forces other people to make sacrifices. Not only that, this advocacy can consist of vile hatred and vitriol--indeed the *best* liberals are those who spit the most venom at the people around them.

It's like saying ""we believe in the goodness of man, but man is pure evil we are waiting for a reason to crucify him as well for any simple mistake or association"".  I guarantee that that is part of the reason why Minnesota in particular, which is extremely collectivist in culture, has a higher depression rate and numerous articles detailing how lonely a lot of transplants are.

"Interesting factoid...the reason that the Federal Reserve money went to the wall street guys and NOT main street guys during the Obama administration was , at least in part, due to the passage of Dodd Frank and attendant regulations.

They were too scared to run afoul of the new laws. 

Fast forward to Trump administration, and he relaxes many of the regulations that were promulgated by the executive branch under the Dodd Frank statutes (i don't have the specifics right off, sorry).  Following the relaxation of federal regulations on lending by commercial banks to ""main street"" businesses, the economy begins to take off and wages start increasing faster than inflation.

"You're both right, and we need to remember an important thing.  Correlation does not mean Causation.  Women who wait for marriage already have a mindset to dig in, do the hard work, and keep vows they've made.  The same goes for men.  Meanwhile, the 42% for even one sexual partner also includes the numbers of women (and men) who are sluts, bang one dude in highschool, get married because their parents throw them both out of the house, realize they're both shitheads, cheat on each other, and get divorced.

The things we do are caused by the people we are.  Every being acts only in accordance with their nature: Even GOD.  God, source of all truth, can not lie.  He is incapable of it, not due to lack of cleverness, but due to strength of character.  Infinitely Honorable, Malicious Untruth is so far beneath God that it is an impossibility.  Much the same way, strength of character will result in a person keeping their vows of abstinence and their marriage vows alike.  This is not to say that someone with the same strength of character might not be averse to premarital sex, they may just manifest their strength of character in other ways.  Ways like loving America and being proud to lend their face to that support.  But neither of us know.

Just saying that maybe you should consider that these numbers you bring up have less to do with being the women's fault, and more to do with...something that isn't that, or a multitude of factors.

Not going to pretend I know like yourself, because...well I don't care about those numbers. Seeing as my wife and I are building our legacy despite your numbers, I'll go with that, and keep the notion that the beauty in this picture could very well be wife material despite exercising her rights.",BassRiderX,e92rh3w,The_Donald

It wasn't true. You'll have GA turn into Venezuela with Stacy. Stacy Abrams & I spoke to LE she's really weak on crime. End death penalty for even most vicious & ruthless killers. Voted against tougher penalties for violent criminals who assaulted our police officers. Stacey wants to turn your wonderful state into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens putting innocent GA families at the mercy of hardened criminals & predators. Abrams voted in favor of allowing illegal aliens to receive public benefits. Oh that's wonderful. She even voted to let illegal aliens HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE! Isn't that wonderful? Stacy Abrams wants illegal aliens to vote. They want them coming in they'll eventually be able to vote & they'll vote for democrats. For other reasons too. Can't let that happen. 

She oposed requiring proof of American citizenship at the ballot box & she recently said she wants illegal aliens to be part of her blue wave. I think her blue wave isn't goiing to happen.

But it is true. I've been working for great Senators. We do whatever we can for Congressmen & women but not so much for governors. this is an important race for GA for Governor. I am here for Brian becuz the gov of GA means so much to our country, to our country. So you gotta get there. You gotta get out there. This is a very worthwhile stop & in addition I happen to like the people of GA so much. It gives me an excuse to say ""Hello.""

If democrats gain power 1 of 1st projects socialist takeover of Amer healthcare. Long waits bad service. They'll possibly come up with that in their campaign. You will not be happy. Obliterate medicare medicare Advantage for more than 635,000 GA srs. who depend on it. GOP will protect medicare for great srs who have earned it & paid for it. Tk U.

"Democrats like to spread false rumors. They're the ones that won't be able to becuz nothing left when your system  is obliterated. They'll raid medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants they want. They are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders & destroy our nation essentially. W/O borders we don't have a nation. Over yrs we've been fighting for other countries borders. Even with worst laws they have given us so little. They don't want to change they want this chaos. I personally think it's backfiring on them & they made a big mistake. Illegal immigration costs our country far more than 100B every single yr. More than double the entire state budget of GA. Illegal immigration is deeply unfair to Amer workers includ African & Hispanic & Asian American workers. Democrats open border policies drain our treasure but endanger Americans. 
Nearly 100% of Heroin thru so. border, 90% of cocaine majority of meth & substantial portion of ultra lethal fentanyl killing our youth. Killed 70,000 Americans. I think they'll do very poorly at ballot box but I may be wrong.

Elizabeth Warren wants to get rid of ICE. Can't call her Pocahontas becuz she has no Indian blood. I have more than she has & I have none. I said that a long time ago b4 she brilliantly sent out test results. That will be great leadership when dealing with China Russia. Not good. She's pushing a guy in OH who would be a disaster. He's a disaster he's worse than she is. Dewine will make a great governor so important. People don't realize how important governorships are. They can destroy states or make it better.

"These two based gentlemen are Canadian. 

&#x200B;

Right now, Trudeau has mandated one of Canada' previous police chiefs to study ""A full ban on handguns and assault weapons in Canada, while not impeding the lawful use of firearms by Canadians,‚Äù

&#x200B;

(Yes they actually called it that).

&#x200B;

This has already become a huge talking point for the next election, coming 2019.

&#x200B;

What you can do to help: (Whether you are Canadian or American)

&#x200B;

The Canadian government put out a survey asking the public if handguns should be banned. You can fill out that survey here:

&#x200B;

[https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/cnslttns/hndgn/index-en.aspx](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/cnslttns/hndgn/index-en.aspx)

&#x200B;

Next thing you can do is let people know about this on Social Media. You can send them to this link:

&#x200B;

[https://thegunblog.ca/2018/08/28/trudeau-says-to-study-full-ban-on-handguns-and-assault-weapons/](https://thegunblog.ca/2018/08/28/trudeau-says-to-study-full-ban-on-handguns-and-assault-weapons/)

&#x200B;

Next thing you can do is join the Canadian NRA (called the CCFR)

&#x200B;

[www.firearmrights.ca](https://www.firearmrights.ca)

&#x200B;

And heck, Canadians were joining the NRA, so I can't see why our American counterparts couldn't join, or at least donate. 

&#x200B;

And last, the only party that has publicly stated that they will protect our gun rights (what little we have), the Canadian Conservative Party, with leader Andrew Scheer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So here‚Äôs a story.  Last weekend, a new Sikh learning center open a few doors down from me after they bought and renovated an old church.  They put invites in all the mailboxes inviting all the neighbors to come learn about them when they officially reopened the building.  Every time they are outside and I‚Äôm walking my dog they always wave with a smile, super nice people from my limited run ins with them.  Anyway on their opening day of the newly renovated church, there were a mass of ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù wearing purple turbans.  A couple hours later I see about 50 people and a million cars on my street and it looked like some shit was about to pop off.  So naturally I had popcorn in one hand ready for an entertaining brawl and my Beretta in the other hand in case shit went to far.  

Needless to say nothing ended up happening but on Sunday I checked my mailbox and found this flyer, which was clearly put there by the purple guys. I have absolutely no idea who they but the fact that according to  the flyer, the Sikh‚Äôs are a cult group promoting rape and murder, they are the ones that clearly left it.  

I will admit I know nothing about either group, but if I‚Äôm choosing, I‚Äôm going with the ‚Äúcult‚Äù because they are polite and nice, while the flyer fucks don‚Äôt even sign their name on a piece of paper that has nothing on it but slander.  Also, if anyone knows who the purple guys are please share as I‚Äôm very curious. 

PS - I will try and upload the pictures but forgive me if it fucks up because I‚Äôm using the Narwhar app and don‚Äôt have it quite figured out yet.

First and easiest way to cheat is to oversample Democrats. But far more insidious is the locations chosen to poll. The pollsters know, for example, where conservative vs RINO Republicans are most likely to be found. So they skip conservative areas and poll 'Republicans,' in wishy washy urban areas where people's favorite politician is probably Paul Ryan (or John Kasisch).

"That's retarded.  It might be semantics, but I do not believe a person can simultaneously be amoral and racist.  Racism is an active, ***immoral*** position.  Amorality simply deprioritizes the moral element of an issue.  It's like the lioness that preys upon the lame gazelle in a herd because that's the logical choice.  She isn't ""evil"" for taking the easy kill and refusing to be sporting -- morality simply fails to be a part of the equation.

People like numbnuts in the tweet simply see ""amoral"" as a zinger with which to accuse people they dislike.  It's just another synonym for ""bad"" to them.

Not to mention, if *I* lost to Trump, *I'd* describe him as a ""mastermind"" or a ""genius"" -- the last sort of person I'd ever want to lose to would be an idiot.  Because, what would that make *me*?",BasedMcCulloch,e92s9z3,The_Donald

Medicare denied the claim saying that according to ""their records"" he could use a walker and didn't need a Power Wheelchair.  He had BOTH LEGS amputated above the knee and couldn't wear prosthetics.  And he had just gotten out of rehab from a bad stroke and one arm was paralyzed.  You know damn good and well Medicare payed the hospital to cut the guys legs off and payed the rehab after the stroke.  They don't even read the letters he spent a month getting from the Dr's.

" **GOD our Glorious ETERNAL Wall builder and Nationalist**

 REV. 21

10¬†And  he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and  shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven  from God,

11¬†Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

12¬†**And  had a WALL great and high**, and had twelve gates, and at the gates  twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the  twelve tribes of the children of Israel:

13¬†On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.

14¬†**And the WALL of the city** had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15¬†And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and **the WALL** thereof.

16¬†And  the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth:  and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The  length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

17¬†And  he measured **the WALL** thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits,  according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.

18¬†And the building of **the WALL** of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.

19¬†And  the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner  of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second,  sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;

20¬†The  fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the  eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the  eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.

21¬†And  the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one  pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent  glass.

22¬†And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.

23¬†And  the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it:  for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.

24¬†And  **the NATIONS** of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and  the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.

25¬†And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.

26¬†And they shall bring **the glory and honour of the NATIONS** into it.

27¬†And  there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither  whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are  written in the Lamb's book of life.",TheDeadBeatLebowski,e91gf1c,The_Donald

"Proverbs 22:28 ""Do not cheat your neighbors by removing the ancient boundary wall your ancestors set up to mark their properties.""  Unlike many of the verses quoted on this thread, this one is *not* out of context.  Another one (after the Israelites returned from captivity Ezra 9:9): ""For we *were* slaves. Yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage; but He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to repair the house of our God, to rebuild its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem."" One of the biggest Old Testament heroes is Nehemiah, who traveled from Persia (modern day Iran) to build a big, beautiful wall in Jerusalem. His wall was just around a city (Jerusalem) but as the verse above references, the king of Persia additionally financed a comprehensive border wall between Judah (an entire state) and Samaria (another country) because the Idumeans were stirring up trouble. If you visit Israel today, you can see pieces of this wall.  Throughout the entire Bible, the image of God as a ""strong tower,"" a ""bulwark"" and a ""wall of strength,"" is common.  Jesus talked about the evil men of the land tearing down the wall around the vineyard, which represents his Kingdom.  On and on.  God is all for walls, because walls bring peace and prosperity and lack of walls creates weakness, division, and strife.

View the bible as the bible, but if an instance like this comes up... Yeah, probably fair game, as long as you're accurate about it and not misrepresenting what was said/done or why it was. Some of the bible serves as a lesson in history and doesn't always reflect how we should live. Especially when looking at the old testament. There's a reason for the new testament.

"Nehemiah 6

1 When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it‚Äîthough up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates‚Äî 

2 Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: ‚ÄúCome, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono.‚Äù But they were scheming to harm me; 

3 so I sent messengers to them with this reply: ‚ÄúI am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?‚Äù 

4 Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.

5 Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter 

6 in which was written: ‚ÄúIt is reported among the nations‚Äîand Geshem\[b\] says it is true‚Äîthat you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king (FAKE NEWS)

7 and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: ‚ÄòThere is a king in Judah!‚Äô Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us meet together.‚Äù (FAKE NEWS)

8 I sent him this reply: ‚ÄúNothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.‚Äù  

9 They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, ‚ÄúTheir hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.‚Äù But I prayed, ‚ÄúNow strengthen my hands.‚Äù

10 One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, ‚ÄúLet us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you‚Äîby night they are coming to kill you.‚Äù  (ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT)

11 But I said, ‚ÄúShould a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!‚Äù 

12 I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.  (HIRED OPPOSITION)

13 He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me. 

14 Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me. 

15 So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days. (A BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL )

I Corinthians: For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness;  But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

Now for children and the mentally retarded, I also assume you mean babies and ones that died of abortion also young children who don't understand the message of salvation? they're going straight up there, `Jesus says it in Matthew 18:3 ""And he said: ""Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."" Now people take this pretty figuratively but it's also quite literal. Not the changing part, I mean, the one about being like little children. They go straight to heaven cause their innocent and like you said many of them wouldn't have heard the message of the cross for some would have died in their mother's womb, others aborted etc 

For people who recognize God but not Jesus, Jesus says it plainly in John 14:6 ""I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father except through me."". God will not acknowledge You if You do not acknowledge His son who is God, see, they're a triune God, God the Father, God the son and God the Holy spirit and they're at the same time one. God will not accept you cause you've not accepted the sacrifice of His son who has paid the price for your sins and covered it wholy.

Yes, you won't get to heaven by what you've done in your life, Ephesians 2:8-9 says ""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast"" 
works here being ""what you've achieved in life"".
Jesus made a way for you to get to heaven and re-established man's connection to God, that path is completely free and open to you and is given as a gift to you, your works won't add to it or subtract to it, your works will only matter at the time of judgement when God judges all.

Oh no, sir, Jesus outlines how we are to obey and live with the commandments, we can't act the way we please and then say ""well I accepted Jesus so I can act in every way possible whether it be evil or good"". The Bible says that we will be judged for our actions, christians especially.  Jesus says it in Matthew 7:21-23
‚ÄúNot everyone who says to Me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.  Many will say to Me in that day, ‚ÄòLord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?‚Äô And then I will declare to them, ‚ÄòI never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!‚Äô

That's why the laws has been outlined so we can act according to it else chrisitans aren't any different from the ones who reject Jesus as well. To answer your point to a still, what you did in life will matter at the time of judgement, doubly so for those who accepted Jesus' sacrifice for them and still chose to act opposite to how He asks us to be.

We'll take your example of Hillary and Bill Clinton, if I recall correctly, they're christians but I'm assuming you know of all the vile things they have done, It's an assumption but I think they've broken every law in the Bible and then some and did everything that is detestable in God's sight, in that way, they will never get to heaven, they will be cast down to hell.

"This theology is flawed. God doesn't change. His kingdom is and always will be exclusive.

In the Old Testament it was exclusive to only those who obeyed His laws and respected His covenant. As we all found out, no one can follow those laws perfectly.

Then Jesus came which allowed all people to have a relationship with God, forming a new covenant. Understand that Jesus spent a lot of time talking about the exclusivity of God's kingdom and the stark division between those who accept Christ and those too proud to accept His grace.

The story of Lazarus and the rich man is a good example, Luke 16:19-31. Matthew 25:31-46 talks about separating people like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He separates the wheat from the chaff, he pulls and burns the weeds, and there will be ""wailing and gnashing of teeth."" Matthew 13:40-43

There has been a perversion of the Gospel that says that Jesus nullified the law and now God is nice and a harmless grandpappy.

"Ever since Bernie ~~lost the primary~~ agreed to a rigged process, Reddit has been infested. It started in politics, news, and has now spread to every major sub, regardless of content. 

Before the Democrat primary ended in 2016, Reddit was still free, and it showed in how every post crticized the establishment, left and right. But when the primary was over, the establishment of the left realized they were in deep trouble. They couldn't win if everyone was against them. I mean daily, 20-25 posts on r/politics we're ANTI leftist establishment policies like the TPP, or leftist politicians. Even some posts criticizing Obama. So the establishment left went into overdrive, sending marching orders to their media puppets, and began infiltrating social media.  I used to be a big lefty and would watch the Young Turks daily (ewww) They never really talked badly about Trump as much as Hillary. But when Bernie was out, they sucked Hillary's dick so hard, and overnight, even as a brainwashed liberal I was like 'WTF?!'

They began manipulating Twitter with scripts to automatically post, like, share, bot voting/manipulation on Reddit, etc. Even Reddit lefty admins like Spez have revealed in their transparency reports, data that shows coordinated positive vote manipulation for leftist subs/posts.

Maybe Reddit can be normalized again, but the leftist tactics will probably drive us all to a new social platform.

"Oh for sure, Hillary threatened to call in some favors with her federal goons regarding Bernie's 10 million dollar embezzlement, among other threats I'm sure, unless he played along.  Which he and the rest of them all did before the debates even started. They were all in on it.

So they did the dog and pony show of the initial debates, but still had to have some of them at least run against her in primaries/caucuses, as an immediate coronation would be very suspect.  Although to almost everyone's surprise, most of all the establishment left, Bernie was polling well.

Despite that, I think they were generally fine with Bernie at first because he was a socialist, and I don't think the leftist establishment realized how popular socialism is with lazy millennials (""GIVE US FREE STUFFFFF!!!"")

But then he started to do much better than he should have in the actual votes.  He almost beat her in Iowa to start things off, and gave her a good run in many places, including Massachusetts, and beat her in places like Michigan.

And for a brief moment at least in the first half to first third of the primaries, I think Bernie ""is a lying scumbag socialist pos"" Sanders truly thought he could win.  After all, if he won, her threats would mean so much less if he then also somehow won the Presidency; so he campaigned harder, lying to everyone more and shilling the false promises of socialism to all us stupid liberals. 

He was doing all sorts of crazy rallies.  Kind of frightening in retrospect, but he almost got President Trump levels of attendance if you don't remember, usually several thousand.

This pissed off the Hillary campaign as they viewed this as a direct violation of their agreement, and thus the infamous emails where Podesta and team HRC specifically mention this.

So despite all the Superdelegates (most famous example was when he won Wyoming by 10 points, but had less total delegates lol) massive voter fraud was occurring.  Ballots for Bernie found in dumpsters, voter suppression by not allowing Bernie voters to vote, changing of rules on the fly (most famously Nevada, and  Iowa tiebreaker rules).

It was all set up from the start, and he had no chance, even if at one point he was going rouge and thought he could win. I'm glad it was all exposed so former liberals like me could see not only what a sham the DNC was, but what a fraud people like Sanders are.

"> put yourself in the shoes of the police.

Unfortunately, I'll never be in the shoes of the police. I could not go along with things like Civil Asset Forfeiture, gun confiscation, or the War on Drugs. There are blatantly unconstitutional laws on the books and I would turn in my badge before enforcing them. I don't have any sympathy for people who break their oaths to defend the constitution by enforcing such laws.

I have a feeling police go along with these things mostly because, if they don't, they have to find a new line of work. In the meantime, they have to explain to their wife and kids why rent isn't getting made and they're getting evicted.

> They have the same constitutional right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness as we all do.

True, but only to a point. Everyone has those rights, but those rights are forfeit when someone violates the rights of others. If that weren't the case, self-defense wouldn't be a thing because someone being attacked wouldn't have the moral authority to shoot back at an attacker.

> And there are lawful ways to get you gun back if it gets taken from you.

True, but the process is it's own punishment. Check out civil asset forfeiture laws. Property has no rights, so you don't have the right to a lawyer to get property back. A lot of the time, the price to get them back is about the same or more than the thing that was taken.

The government DOES have the authority to take property (including guns) from people, but it needs to pass a MUCH higher bar to take way such rights. People need to either be proven a criminal with a guilty verdict, or declared incompetent and given a guardian who exercises the rights on their behalf.",RemoveAllKebab,e942z3q,The_Donald

Open your eyes, every European country that opened their hearts to Muslim ""Refugees"" was Invaded by INGRATES who committed crimes beyond European imagination. Invaders who gang raped their women (and little boys). Invaders who committed murder on a grand scale unimaginable to Europeans. (Nazis were more efficient but less vile.)

As for the Left, Planned Parenthood (Margaret Sanger, Hillary's stated hero), and associates (familiars): they've murdered just under a million babies. What piece of an infant will convince you? Heart liver lung arm leg? The misery, the pain, the humiliation, it's all there for the glory of their unrecognized MASTER.

The rank and file of the Left do not realize who they serve. They are just Snowflakes and worse. The leaders Soros, Clintons, British Royalty they know and have been richly rewarded for their treachery. NOW you have been told (confronted).

I have cheated. I did not come by my understanding fairly, I had an NDE. I do not have faith I have fact. You live in a description of the end times but you lack an understandinf of ""time"" which is itself is damn near meaningless. (""the end is near""?  really? You only live 80 years, the end was near the day you were born.)

"They key about Obamacare, though, is it was \*supposed to fail\* and it was \*supposed to be the Republican's fault\*.

This, in no way, gives Republicans an excuse for not fixing it since getting control, but...

The left wants Single Payer.  They want an NHS, with massive taxes and borrowing and government regulation of your care.  Every time they tell you you can keep your doctor, or that your doctors won't override your medical decisions, just reflect back on all the horror stories you hear from Britain of courts blocking medical options and slapping gag orders and no-flight orders on the victims so they can't complain or escape.

They want power.

The whole goal was to set up a ponzi scheme that the Insurance companies would jump onboard with for massive upfront profits, but which would INEVITABLY collapse under it's own weight.  And they tried to bully Republicans into voting for it.  Just a handful of RINOS would have done;

\*If even one republican had voted for it, the narrative would have been that everything good was the Democrats' single payer stuff, and everything bad was put in by Republicans to get their votes, so throw the R's out and let us do Single Payer right.\*

But the Republicans all said no, and the Democrats, having made too many promises to too many constituents, had to go forward, with no exit strategy.  Because now it belonged to them.

Obamacare was never supposed to be OBAMAcare.  He made all kinds of promises on what good healthcare would look like, in full knowledge that he was talking out his ass, because it wasn't his law.  He had an out when ""the Republicans screwed it all up"" by pointing to his speeches and saying the law isn't what HE wanted, they screwed it up, but he had to sign it for the children.  Let us make what we wanted to without the Republicans and it'll all be good.

Alas, it's now known as OBAMAcare, and it IS his legacy.  And it's the only piece of his legacy to still be around.  The Democrats suffered bigtime for their support, and the Republicans got a lot of credit for promising to stop it.  However, it's totally royally screwed up, and for every person actually fucked by the law, there's two people totally dependent on it staying around... so the Republicans have a pretty bad dilemma;  the concept of ""repeal, collapse, rebuild"" would have bankrupted the Republican party before Trump, because they never would have gotten out of Step 2 and the Democrats would have gotten back their ""Republicans screwed it up!"" talking point.

Even now, we've got the votes to repeal and collapse, but not to actually rebuild.  And other than platitudes like ""Free Market"", there really isn't a plan on how to transition all those people who ARE dependent on Obamacare into something better for everyone.",AutoDMC,e91svq0,The_Donald

"Except it's not that easy, because the ""old system"" was completely destroyed, and the Democrats kept their abortion of a system running long enough to screw everyone over.  *It was designed to destroy the old system.*

For example, it made it impossible for insurance companies to break even, then put the taxpayers on the hook to pay the downfalls.  As much as I don't like the machinations of Aetna and BCBS, if we want to ""go back to the old system"" we need them to be functional.  Just yanking out the old law *will* trigger a collapse of the very companies you want to ""go back to.""

We have to give the Democrats credit where credit is due... They do poison pills, self destruct clauses, and legislative traps well.  If the spineless RINOs had town up Obamacare like eight years ago when we told them to do it, it would have been painful, but doable.  They let the legal cancer metastasize.

In a way, the Democrats got what they wanted after all.  The public perception of Obamacare really isn't that mysterious... The old system did have a problem with pre-existing conditions, so everyone who now had subsidized insurance is rightfully terrified to lose it.  We're talking about crippling 50,000 dollar a year medical problems that we don't have a ready solution for.  Over the years, as Obamacare stuck around, people have forgotten about Like Your Doctor Keep Your Doctor, and they already have a new Obamacare doctor, so that's not a pain point.  The media and Democrats have non-stop praised the currently existing system while vomiting the alternatives, and the RINOs have publicized nothing but If You Like Your Doctor You Will Probably Lose Them.

Trump isn't really teaching the Rs how to win races, they can do that just fine if they can get the voters out.  He's teaching them how to win the court of public opinion.  We're on the cusp of having that on our side... My only remaining concern is that the Democrats have been putting polish on Obamacare for fifty years for maximum sabotage...

Riders not familiar with their polling place; most voters have been to their polling place.

Rides from unusual places to the polls, like from a bus, or any place you do not normally find riders.

In the past lethal weapons and tactics tended to stay lethal for a long time with occasionally huge improvements in some area, think of it like punctuated equilibrium.

Now so much is about sensors and computing power and software and really cutting edge engineering.  Some in the U.S. Navy already think our carrier battle groups are obsolete in terms of real warfare.  Now we've invested in a ton  already and they are great for force projection and all sorts of missions, but it's no secret that as awesome as a carrier is it's a huge target and there are all kinds of ways to attack one.  Once upon a time the CAG's group formed a perimeter and the airwing formed an even greater one.  You had layers and you had pretty damn good radar coverage and sub hunting.  We still have all that, but now we have enemies with hypersonic cruise missiles that can stay just above the watet.  We had Iran which has decided that a simultaneous suicide wave of speedboats attacking in narrow waters might be hard to fully repel.  And God only knows for sure what's going on underwater.

Additionally, if there‚Äôs no transaction/record of the transfer of the firearm, and a crime is committed with the weapon & left behind, the original owner is in trouble.

"I am the CEO of a decent sized company,  here is what you do. 

1) Document everything - interactions you had with this co-worker, interactions with your management and HR on the subject, even when you may have browsed TD.

2) Speak to a labor lawyer. Now. Lay out your case clearly. Do not embellish, exaggerate or lie. 

**This may not be needed but doing this is insurance. It protects you.**

3) Do not go to your management about this, go **DIRECTLY** to HR.

You do not want to include your management as it has the potential to create bias. Plus it could put your management in a legal bind if this got ugly. Let HR make the call if your management needs to be in the loop. 

Remember that HR **IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. THEY ARE THERE TO PROTECT THE COMPANY.**  When speaking with them be factual, just as you were with the lawyer. Do not be emotional. Do not be threatening. Just lay out your case.

4) **DELETE THIS POST**. If your HR department, or the person making the claim, finds this post it potentially can look like you are the one with the bias.

You are calling the person ""batshit insane"" and making assumptions that the coworker is in the ""I'm with her"". You are also now on record saying you are contemplating vandalism. This could, potentially, be seen as a fire offence depending on how hardline your company is.

You want them to have as little a case against you as possible.

> Defamation is an act of communication that causes someone to be shamed, ridiculed, held in contempt, lowered in the estimation of the community, or to lose employment status or earnings or otherwise suffer a damaged reputation. Such defamation is couched in 'defamatory language'. Libel and slander are subcategories of defamation. In order to prove defamation, the plaintiff must prove:

> 1.; that a statement was made about the plaintiffs reputation, honesty or integrity that is not true;
2.; publication to a third party (i.e., another person hears or reads the statement); and
3.; the plaintiff suffers damages as a result of the statement.

> Slander is a form of defamation that consists of making false oral statements about a person which would damage that person's reputation. Typically, damages, such as loss of earnings, demotion, firing, denial of benefits, etc. would need to proven to show harm in the workplace.",Chistock,e91k7of,The_Donald

I had a similar situation with a former manager of mine. Luckily he was a rank ass piece of shit with no redeeming values who people only slightly tolerated and he was noted for wishing people to drown in a hurricane in the workplace. It helped that he was fucking humiliated time and time again as I correctly predicted that the POTUS would negotiate peace with North Korea and the r/politics information he read from his iPhone was proven wrong by reality repeatedly. You might want to check around and see HOW she talks about politics in the workplace and get your peers' opinions. Does she wish for others to die based on their political beliefs? Does she condescend and call them garbage? Do her political rants get in the way of conducting her job professionally?

"Matterhorn's reply is great. Another reason for \~5,200 troops compared to a smaller caravan is simply that there is a lot of land area to watch. The migrants have maps, indicating multiple different paths to travel to enter the country, so it is very likely it will split up as it nears the border. Additional troops allow for better coverage of the border, as well as a higher ""safety factor"". 

&#x200B;

Having the larger force will improve the safety of both the US military, but also of any migrants (Let's be honest, no one except libs want to see a child shot in the news).

&#x200B;

The only concern I can see against a larger troop deployment is how much it costs. I don't see this as a very valid point though - out of all of the things our military is used for, protecting our border is probably one of the most important uses. A domestic deployment like this should be far less expensive than overseas (per troop).",NcVii,e92c4t8,The_Donald
"It's the logistics and support that takes up so many soldiers. The military has to provide for it's own, and doesn't (rarely) outsource it's own logistics and support. So for every 1 infantryman, there's like 4 guys supporting him at any one time. Just for that single helicopter alone there's about 50 soldiers ""in the rear"" to keep it flying: 8 different technicians, fuelers, part suppliers, run way operators, air traffic controllers, cooks for the pilot to eat, etc. I bet there's maybe 2000 soldiers in a front line role, everything else is support.

Also, to be really effective, they should embed border patrol into those infantry squads so when they do make drops like this, the border patrol can make the arrests and the infantry can set up security. Makes me wish I was in the Army again.",ModernT1mes,e92hrw4,The_Donald

And the recent conclusion of 10 scientists, several grants, several institutions, several studies, and several research programs in the United States:

""Although the mechanism by which ketogenic diets demonstrate anticancer effects when combined with standard radio-chemo-therapies has not been fully elucidated, preclinical results have demonstrated the safety and potential efficacy of using ketogenic diets in combination with radio-chemo-therapy to improve responses in murine cancer models. These preclinical studies have provided the impetus for extending the use of ketogenic diets into phase I clinical trials that are currently ongoing.""
