>As Dr. Fiske has written, “Both science and history suggest that people will nurture and act on their prejudices in the worst ways when these people are put under stress, pressured by peers, or receive approval from authority figures to do so.”

-Richard Nixon barely lost the presidential election of 1960, then decided to run for president again and won in 1968.

So not only is there precedence for a candidate who won the popular vote running again and winning, but there's also precedence for someone who already ran for president and lost running again and winning.

And in fact, *every* person who won the popular vote for president and lost the election who then ran again *all* won the next time.

What people aren't realising is that Russia and the GOP hate machine won't go away if Hillary doesn't run again. They are priming for anyone who wins the Dem nomination. Biden, Harris, Duckworth, Booker, Sanders, whomever, once they're the Dem nominee they will be just as hated and just as maligned online by an army of bots making it seem real and cool to hate them and the GOP will make them the devil incarnate like they did Hillary.

This GOP hate machine didn't even start with Clinton. It started with Obama, they made him the devil incarnate for the conservative base.

Even more disingenuous when he's spewing his tired spiel about a government benefiting the wealthy while shamelessly trying to profit off his position and influence.

He's basically spent the last two years bashing Democrats and now it seems like he's trying to capitalize off the blue wave momentum.

Seriously though, what was the point of that AMA? He talks a lot of anti-Trump stuff but not one mention of progressive candidates we should be voting for. At this point he's nothing more than a copy and paste politician.

- I don't yet have proof, but it seems to me that HBJ responded to overtures from MBS. Naturally, Kushner owes MBS in favors as well as money. Without MBS, Kushner didn't have the line of credit he needed to offload 666 on August 3rd 2018.

- Jared Kushner ""greenlit"" Khashoggi

- MBS (Mr. Bone Saw) ordered Jamal Khashoggi murdered

- Mashal Saad al Bostani (who was himself killed by KSR security forces on October 18 2018) and Salah Muhammed A Tubaigy and others implemented the murder ordered by MBS
The murderers will probably be killed to ensure that this doesn't get back to MBS (Mr. Bone Saw).

"You need to interview more than 430 though to be able to draw valid conclusions about an entire subsection of society. Especially when that conclusion is condensed to 'Trump voters say white men are discriminated against more than women, gays, minorities'. A more genuine title would read 18% of 430 republican voters believe that men are discriminated against more than etc because if you look at the survey it doesn't mention white men, just men. Lets not get into the sub title of the article either which states that 'Nearly half of Trump voters said men face either “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of discrimination in America today.' With about 63 million people who voted for Trump the article is claiming that 31.5 million+ people believe men are discriminated against more, when the reality is that 160 people think that is the case.",blahblahblah80,e88l6jd,hillaryclinton

There's plenty of Democrat messaging going on yet you have publications like the Daily Beast publishing Hillary bashing articles by GOP strategists, passing them off as ""journalists"". 

I read this ""article"" from Liz Mair... a whole lot of garbage. She basically admits that bashing Hillary is a public service to Republicans like her.

"Meh.
I'm not absolutely against her but I cant get excited about her possible candidacy either.
She's too limited for my liking. Never hear her about race, women's rights, lgtb rights, foreign policy and so on.
I was appaled by her attempts to win over the bernie crowd by claiming the primaries were rigged.
Then when she attacked Obama for his speeches, she kinda lost any appeal she might have had for me.",Danie2009,e81dkc4,hillaryclinton

"No. In my local community the county board of elections received instructions from the state Republican party to reduce early voting capability as much as possible because Democrats rely on the flexibility more. They also removed a voting location away from a historically black college to nudge things in their favor. As part of a statewide plan, these nudges add up. It's straight up an effort to keep people from voting. It's undemocratic and un-American.

With voter ID, it's a question of motives. If there is no voter fraud problem in my state and the current verification methods work, why ask for voter ID? The belief is that it will further disenfranchise Democratic voters. It's another nudge and another effort whose real motive is to stop Americans from exercising their rights.

[deleted],,e7pfjvp,hillaryclinton
"Hillary delivered some pretty critical commentary towards the administration lately and she might be anticipating that her own security clearance will be revoked as a consequence, like former CIA director (and frequent Trump critic) John Brennan's was. When that happened, it dominated the news cycle for awhile. Plus, the President revoking security clearances because he disagrees with them politically is not something that was done before Trump.

My interpretation of this is that Hillary would rather voluntarily give up her security clearance rather than having it *revoked* because 1) revocation would create a bigger news story, the press would rehash 2016, and more important issues would be ignored and 2) she doesn't want to take part in establishing this new precedent of the President revoking security clearances for people he doesn't like. She wants to limit the ability of Trump to politicize the security clearance process.",secretlovesong,e7p91wt,hillaryclinton
"Well firstly, he can’t try to take it away now. And she’s showing the world she’s not looking to use or abuse her security clearance to influence anything against him. ",Lamzn6,e7p8ghh,hillaryclinton
"Clearances don’t quite work like that. They’re one part of the requirements that gets you access to sensitive material — the other is “need to know.” If she doesn’t have a “need to know,” she can’t access classified material even with a clearance.   
  
So really, it would’ve been more of a symbolic tool — not very useful. Pretty sure she could easily get it reinstated if she returns to service. ",noirthesable,e7pjlzb,hillaryclinton

I'm a Democrat, and I've always been in the economic & foreign policy progressive wing of the party, the one which usually gets its clock cleaned by the moderates.

When Bernie spends time standing up for Democrats instead of bashing them and giving ammunition to the right to do the same then I'll gladly give him credit. 

Bannon is pointing out what Bernie is doing to help the right. I agree.

Imagine the Church of Scientology had tens of millions of members and a multi-billion dollar propaganda operation - even it's own magazines and TV channel. Imagine you knew a lot of them... they were your neighbors, family members, and co-workers.

You have to think of people like Boot as having just left a cult. When Max Boot was a kid and getting interested in politics no one told him the GOP was nuts. His mother and father probably just thought ""Well, we hate communism because we lived under it, and these Republicans really hate communism too, so that's for us.""

Point is a lot of us could've ended up carrying water for the cult just like Boot.

I recommend [his interview on weekslystandard](https://www.weeklystandard.com/tws-podcast/max-boot-on-the-corrosion-of-conservatism).

">Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh decided that to have any chance to reach the court, he would have to shed the pretense he was a fair-minded, calm, judicious thinker. **He came out in the afternoon filled with venom, screaming at the committee. His life was being ruined, he claimed. This was a Clinton-like smear.** His anger was both **frightening and unexpected** — if you thought he was that intellectual whom conservatives have swooned over. He yelled, and he cried. If you thought he was sincere, one could also appreciate how **partisan and emotional** he had become.

~

>If President Trump loved the nasty, male grievance game, the rest of us had reason to wonder if anyone of this temperament — Cornyn, Graham or Kavanaugh — should be in a position of power. **If they were women, they would be called “hysterical.”**

~

>The refusal to get the facts is both a telling admission of concern about what they would find and a violation the judicial goal of truth-seeking. It’s **a political calculation, exactly what you don’t want to see from a judge**.

~

>The worst moment was his confrontation with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) who questioned him about blackout drinking. She explained that she understood alcohol abuse because her father was an alcoholic. Have you ever blacked out? she asked. He sneered in response, “Have you?” It was **a moment of singular cruelty and disrespect**. One saw a flash in the exchange with Klobuchar the same **sense of entitlement, cruelty and lack of simple decency** that Christine Blasey Ford allegedly experienced way back when, the memory seared in her brain of two obnoxious teens laughing at her ordeal.

~

>Kavanaugh says he was not the attacker. But even if you believe that — despite Ford’s riveting testimony — one can reasonably conclude he is not the right person to sit on the court. **His anger toward liberals is palpable, his lack of humility bracing. He has the partisan mindset that opponents are unworthy of respect and kindness.**

~

>... his heart is that of a **conservative partisan**, one who tried so very hard to make himself into Supreme Court material. The **mentality of a political operative** — willing to go on Fox News, **ready to inflame passions, disrespectful toward opponents** — is still there. A nonpartisan would ask for, if not demand, an FBI investigation and Judge’s appearance. Kavanaugh wants to avoid both at all costs.

Protecting Trump is the only thing that matters anymore.  Let's say any evidence comes out Trump was supported by the Russian State directly.  It would implicate and destroy the entire Republican party.  In order to preserve their power, they must destroy the country first.

"I don't know how to process today but one thing that is clear to me is that Kavanaugh told lies under oath in pursuit of this job. Obvious lies about things he was asked directly about. He lied about his drinking. He lied about the meaning of the messages in his yearbook. He also became belligerently defensive about these issues. These weren't oopsies or incomplete memories. He intentionally and repeatedly misrepresented the facts in order to minimize the truth about the kind of person he was and is.

The other thing that really stood out is that he came out of the game spouting conspiracy theories and partisan hackery.

Finally, Ford didn't hesitate or stammer or equivocate. She was asked how certain she was and she said she is 100% certain that Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape her. Not some unknown guy. Not, she's sure she was assaulted but less sure by whom. 100% sure it was Brett Kavanaugh. And Republicans all heard that and every single person there said she was credible and they believe she was assaulted. But EVERY SINGLE republican also said they think they know better than she does about who did this to her.

">Michael Schmidt, we should recall and as I recount in my book (pp. 105–113 in the paperback) was the reporter who wrote the misleading (and quietly retracted) initial stories about Hillary Clinton’s emails that launched the “scandal” — and he was at the head of the media juggernaut that kept it running throughout the campaign. Now, he’s nabbed a new headline based on what may well have been a sardonic joke made by Rosenstein about recording Trump. The notes were fragmentary, the tone was unclear and — most significantly — never resulted in action of any sort.

>Now we must do all we can to save our democracy and heal our body politic.

>First, **we’ve got to mobilize massive turnout in the 2018 midterms.** There are fantastic candidates running all over the country, making their compelling cases every day about how they’ll raise wages, bring down health-care costs, and fight for justice. If they win, they’ll do great things for America. And we could finally see some congressional oversight of the White House.

>When the dust settles, we have to do some serious housecleaning. After Watergate, Congress passed a whole slew of reforms in response to Richard Nixon’s abuses of power. After Trump, we’re going to need a similar process. For example, Trump’s corruption should teach us that all **future candidates for president and presidents themselves should be required by law to release their tax returns. They also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules.**

>**A main area of reform should be improving and protecting our elections**. The Senate Intelligence Committee has made a series of bipartisan recommendations for how to better secure America’s voting systems, including **paper ballot backups, vote audits, and better coordination among federal, state, and local authorities on cybersecurity.** That’s a good start. Congress should also repair the damage the Supreme Court did to the **Voting Rights Act by restoring the full protections that voters need and deserve**, as well as the voting rights of Americans who have served time in prison and paid their debt to society. We need **early voting and voting by mail in every state** in America, and automatic, **universal voter registration** so every citizen who is eligible to vote is able to vote. We need to **overturn Citizens United and get secret money out of our politics**. And you won’t be surprised to hear that I passionately believe it’s time to **abolish the Electoral College**.

>But even the best rules and regulations won’t protect us if we don’t find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and **rekindle our civic spirit**. There are concrete steps that would help, like greatly expanding national-service programs and bringing back civics education in our schools. We also need **systemic economic reforms** that reduce inequality and the unchecked power of corporations and give a strong voice to working families. And ultimately, healing our country will come down to each of us, as citizens and individuals, doing the work—trying to reach across divides of race, class, and politics and see through the eyes of people very different from ourselves. When we think about politics and judge our leaders, we can’t just ask, “Am I better off than I was four years ago?” We have to ask, “Are we better off? Are we as a country better, stronger, and fairer?” **Democracy works only when we accept that we’re all in this together.**

That isn't the case and isn't how the electoral college works. Again, you don't understand it.

Because this is a huge, diverse country and letting a handful of liberal urban centers control literally every single presidential election is stupid. We're a union of 50 states.

>How exactly does direct democracy suck?

Because people are fucking idiots. Some of them can't even understand the basic point of the electoral college! There is not a single surviving direct democracy in the world today for a good reason.

>Kavanaugh has consistently argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has limited authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon and other pollutants that are causing the planet to heat up.

>Kavanaugh would replace Justice Kennedy, who was the deciding vote in a pivotal 2007 Supreme Court case that established greenhouse gases were ""well within"" the EPA's authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act and made it possible for the agency to start reining in emissions.

>Replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh would swing the Court to a new, hard-right majority that would rule against curbing greenhouse gases for years—maybe decades—that we can’t afford to waste on inaction.

>During the Obama years, Kavanaugh came down against the EPA in every one of the three major cases he heard about the agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

>Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion for the D.C. Circuit Court in 2012 that struck down a federal program to curb cross-state pollution from power plants.

>In 2016, he argued that the Clean Air Act was a ""thin statute"" to support the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants.

"Sigh.. What was an enjoyable lunch break is being ruined as I sit here and listen to this guy next to me talk to his colleague...

""For the most part I don't like anything Trump has done but at least he's not Hillary."" ""I did like his tax bill though."" 

""I used to be a liberal Democrat but a few years ago I became conservative.""

""Liberals have shouted racism so much that it's lost its meaning and now people are more racist."" bla bla bla ""Identity politics."" 

Then he went on to say again that he doesn't like Trump and how polarizing Trump is and that when he and his wife were traveling internationally last year people would ask where they're from and he'd say American and they'd roll their eyes at him with ""ooh, *Trump*"" and he that didn't make him feel good and was embarrassing. 

So he's conservative, used to be liberal just a couple years ago, and hates Trump. But hates Clinton more? I can't imagine what Clinton did to make him ""Never Hillary,"" especially when he was liberal just a few years ago, but whatever it was, why not also be ""Never Trump"" if he's so aware to how awful and embarrassing Trump is?

Populist politics is extremely dangerous - we're seeing it with Trump right now. We've seen it with the Germans pre-WWII when their brand of populism failed and allowed extremists to take over. That's what is happening now.

Populism is dangerous whether its from the left or the right. There's no point in electing candidates on the basis of their rhetoric if they can't deliver once in office. Populism feeds the masses without actually providing actual solutions. It's a power play tactic. 

If the voting public actually care about how laws are changed then they should care enough not to vote on rhetoric alone because we all know that fizzles out eventually. 

Policy detail is exactly the thing we need to be thinking about in progressive candidates. For far too long we've had so called progressive candidates who have been elected on their rhetoric and then have failed to deliver once in office. You call it the establishment but they did exactly what people like ACO are doing now to get elected.

They use populist rhetoric to get elected and then stay in office for years without doing anything. This is exactly the thing we should be fighting against.

I'll actually disagree here especially in terms of the red wave - yes she might have had the GOP congress and senate but we all know she would have veto'd those tax cuts and not even allowed Obamacare to be changed. And as for the red wave - I don't think that would have happened because this is where her experience would have come in to play. I love Obama but his inexperience resulted in the dems losing the house but Clinton as president would have been far more experienced and politically shrewd. She was already anticipating 2018 even during the campaign. She was already advocating for a lot of the candidates who are winning now.

>One reason for that is a lot of people have grown disgusted with the limits of the status quo. One party found a way to validate that, the other wasn't in that position.

We're not in power because of people being disgusted with status quo. If that was the case the GOP wouldn't have won congress and senate in 2016. They kept power on the back of populist rhetoric. There was no validation here.

No one stuck their heads in the sand. That's kind of false. Democrats didn't pretend that everything was fine. They just engage that narrative on extreme rhetorics with false promises.

The only ""Elite out-out-touch complacency"" came from Trump. I feel like this a huge misrepresentation of what happened and is a result of the dangerous populist politics at play.

Your message about moderation I agree with completely. But there's no moderate populism. We just have to hope the right kind of candidate replies to it - one who has tangible plans and policies to address populist concerns beyond grandstanding and rhetoric. 

There's no point in being in power if you can't do anything with that power. If AOC and other populist candidates get elected under Trump and a GOP government then what's the point of their ideology and rhetoric if they can't make anything happen? ",FrankieGH,e5h0rd5,hillaryclinton

Yes the trend is that the opposite party gains the midterms but trends are not concrete. And that's my point - Hillary knew even when she was running how important it was for down candidates to succeed. You might not agree based on your opinion of her, but she would have made it a priority to get Dems back in power which is what Obama failed at when he became president. She is just more politically astute.

>and Clinton's skills (even her most ardent supporters usually admit) weren't those suited to the bully pulpit and rallying public pressure. 

And this is completely false. You won't see any ardent supporters admit to this because it's completely false. There's a difference to being suited to the bullying pulpit vs getting attention from the media. I don't think you should misrepresent her skills by tying in her supporters. Her supporters know better than anyone else what she can do. Do you think a woman like her would have elected senator twice, run for the nomination in2008 when she lost by a 1% (she probably won the popular vote) and then run again and win handily if she didn't have the skills suited for the ""bully pulpit""? 

>Let's face it, we'd be mid-impeachment trials right now.
And this is where you betray yourself - what exactly what she be impeached about? This is the argument people used to dissuade independents not to vote for her but there's no basis. There's literally nothing that she could be impeached for.  This is the argument the far left uses as a justification for her not being in office which is ridiculous.

>But despite her triangulation she'd be getting obstructed by the whole right as a communist, and from a much more unchastened left as a neoliberal. Not a recipe for productive success.

And again... you assume there would be this partisan politics at play. She might have got obstructed from the right but she could have also prevented all the destructive things Trump and the right have enabled - tax cuts... obamacare under threat... CHIP... DACA... muslim ban... the Paris agreement. All of those things would have been prevented if she was president even with a GOP congress and senate. And the only people on the left who would call her a neoliberal as a negative label (because these people only care about labels) are not in the government.

Either ways, liberal values and policies would be far more protected than they are now even if populist candidates like AOC win. Cause they can win but how do they exactly hope to achieve their socialist rhetoric under a Republican president whether it be Trump or Pence. They have no plan to achieve their ideologies. What's the point then?

Do you think a person like her would have been elected Senator twice if she didn't have intimate access to a former 2-term POTUS's rolodex, staff, and list of favors to call in -- such as making sure the other primary candidates in the blue state to which she had just moved, withdrew before she entered?

And btw she did run against primary candidates - they lost the first time and even harder the second time because she served NY well. There's a reason they love her in NY.  You're insinuating a lot of things here... why don't you back them up with facts?

And yes she did win handily in the 2016 primaries - she beat Bernie by almost 3 million votes - that's not close at all. In 2008 she lost to Obama by less than300,000 votes. So yes her victory in the 2016 primary was more than comfortable. If you disagree and want to imply it was rigged (like y'all usually do) then provide receipts instead of hurt egos.

Yeah sorry but AOC winning in NY isn't an indication of the leftist populist movement across the country and that's been proven with a lot of primary wins.  The party isn't going to automatically endorse far left candidates accross the country because states like NY elect them. And regardless, populist candidates have been running and they've lost - why can't you accept that? Bernie lost. And a lot of the candidates he endorsed lost as well. At the end of the day you can't look beyond the party when it's about your beliefs - sorry but there are democrats who are not ""far left"". And we're going to elect people who are not ""far left"".

And again, all of this is false. Party leaders and Obama didn't tell him not to run because they'd rake him over the coals... that's completely false. Firstly that was not the reason and secondly neither obama or any party leader was part of his decision and he's spoken about this. So it's curious where you're getting these ""facts"" from? And if you read his book, you'll see that he and Hillary had discussed running against each other and were okay with it as long as they didn't run negative campaigns against each other. Again, these are facts not ""establishment/party"" conspiracies which you keep trying to imply.

And also about Lowey's experience - she dropped out and was even supporting Hillary for the seat before she dropped out.  It's not red carpet treatment at all. This is what people who support their party do. Also by this logic, the party would have probably not Bernie run since he was an independent but of course that's not true because it's not the party at play here. 

You seem to be insinuating that Hillary was gifted all her elections - can you say that about her re-election to the Senate?

HELOC = Home equity line of credit,wi_voter,e50f9vc,hillaryclinton
Here is a link to an article about how much money in HELOC resets occurred between 2014 and 2017.  https://www.ezlandlordforms.com/articles/news/382/billions-in-helocs-due-to-reset-from-2014-2017-fueling-fears-of-a-coming-storm/.   111 billion dollars worth of HELOC resets between 2014 and the end of 2017. But the first 50 plus Billions in HELOC resets occurred during Obama's second term. In terms of geography. Lets not forget that Republicans won something like 90% or higher of the total land area of the United States. So trouble with HELOC resets could have occurred in many Republican leaning areas of the country.,VHSalessandro,e50tzyo,hillaryclinton
"I guess its difficult to explain. The HELOC's reset in 2014, which was when Obama was still in office. From 2014 though 2016 hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of HELOC's began resetting. This means that the monthly payment doubled or tripled. Many people who were never late on their payments could not afford a doubling of the payment. The obvious solution was to offer a Replacement HELOC so homeowners would have another 10 years of interest only payments. Their homes were the collateral so the HELOC was a safe investment.  There were millions of voters who wanted more than politicians making deals with each other to make each other look good.

As for Trump, it was the combination of an agreement between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to not admit to anything that could look like an oversight or mistake, including not responding to Bernie Sanders and some crazy claims he was making against Hillary Clinton. Then factor in Obama's not so nice comment about the Heartland having a lot of Bible Thumping, Gun Loving, Bitter over losing jobs, people.

A RENEWAL HELOC was not a Bailout since it was based on home equity and would simply renew the terms of the prior HELOC for another 10 years, meaning the homeowner would just keep making their payments as they had for the prior 10 years before.

Actually, I'm extremely familiar with the problems that aggressive male sexual behaviour cause for women. I've listened to my partner describe harassment on the street and in public locations by men on a daily and weekly basis for as long as I have known her.

"""Blame men"" is not ""discussing the fact that women who reject a man sometimes end up murdered and that most murderers are men."" ""Blame men"" is identity politics.

Should we ""blame black people"" because black people on average have a higher rate of murders than white people? No. There are a complex web of historical and socioeconomic reasons for this, such as slavery, such as Jim Crow, such as mass incarceration of black fathers via the war on drugs.

Well there's a complex web of phenomena behind this. Men today did not invent the expectation that men should make the first move in dating, or male ""toughness"" & ""boys don't cry"", or the idea that a rejection is somehow an insult. Those things are nasty inheritances that have arisen from the fact that our societies have developed in a patriarchal manner, and these expectations have proven difficult to shed.

The civil rights acts of 64 and 65 created this demographic shift, right or wrong that’s the nature of the two parties.

Being called racist and sexist is what white men deal with within the Democratic Party.  I personally experienced at the county state and national level with other Democrats that I would meet.  Denying racism or sexism I’ve experienced is no different than denying racism or sexism anyone else experiences.

Democrats need to understand and address the issues white men experience to win elections across the country.  If they want to remain a party for the coasts of the US we are in for a long ride.

Labeling a white man as entitled without understanding his experience doesn’t address the issue democrats face demographically but was a common tactic Hillary Supporters used and Obama Supporters did not.  That’s why he won and she couldn’t.

Yes, it is important to push back against the oppression of individuals based on their race, sex, orientation, religion, and gender.

White men are simply not oppressed based on their race or sex.  To act as though there's an oppression that needs to be pushed back against is white supremacy.

The homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him he’s privileged and that’s why you won’t give him any money.

Even Trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  If white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.

A year ago I moved from Oklahoma to Los Angeles.  The two cultures are so vastly different.  The Democratic Party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country that’s why we are where we are at.  In Oklahoma where I was apart of the Democratic Party, the Hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in Oklahoma as sexist and say that’s why they wouldn’t vote for Clinton but at the very same time we had a female Republican governor running the state.  Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Arizona and many other “Red” states have had female governors while states like New York and California have not.

It’s not about privilege, race or gender it’s about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.

"> If you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.

I never said this. Nobody actually ever says this. They say (something like) having white skin is a privilege.  That's different than legit thinking that all white men are privileged. I mean, obviously, we people in Los Angeles don't think this.  We see white homeless folks every day.  The right willfully misinterprets this, just like they did with Black Lives Matter (Too)... not (Only) Black Lives Matter.  To be honest, I'd like there to be a better word than 'privilege,' because it gets easily misinterpreted... but, then, when you have a massive machine trying to discredit liberals who want to get rid of the bigoted oppression of individuals based on what 'group' they belong to, any phrase you use will get twisted to be intentionally misunderstood.   

""Sad to say but Democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican.""  This is far from true.  Most Republicans voted for Trump.  He is a fascist bigot who openly stated he wanted to ban all Muslims from entering America.  You are engaging in a false equivalency.  

""It’s not about privilege, race or gender."" For people who are oppressed, daily, based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion?  Yes, it is about that.  A poor black dude faces oppression that a poor white dude does not.  This doesn't mean a poor white dude has an easy life - that's not how existence works.  Like, the fact that my skin color doesn't cause me to be oppressed... that doesn't mean my life is sunshine, roses, gold, and happiness. 

It's just that society does not oppress a poor white dude because of his whiteness. 

The greatest trick ever pulled was to oppress people based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion...

"#For Those Paywalled

New data makes it clear: Nonvoters handed Trump the presidency

Then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shakes hands as he arrives at a campaign rally on Aug. 30, 2016, in Everett, Wash. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)

Most of our assessments of the electorate in 2016 are dependent on estimates. Polling before the election that suggested where people were leaning; exit polling after the fact that gives us some sense of who actually turned out. When more than 137 million people vote, understanding exactly who they were and why they voted the way they did necessarily involves some guesswork.

On Thursday, though, Pew Research Center released an unusually robust survey of the 2016 electorate. In addition to having asked people how they voted, Pew’s team verified that they did, giving us a picture not only of the electorate but also of those who didn’t vote. There are a number of interesting details that emerge from that research, including a breakdown of President Trump’s support that confirms much of his base has backed him enthusiastically since the Republican primaries.

The data also makes another point very clear: Those who didn’t vote are as responsible for the outcome of the election as those who did.

As we noted shortly after the election, about 30 percent of Americans were eligible to vote but decided not to, a higher percentage than the portion of the country who voted for either Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Pew’s data shows that almost half of the nonvoters were nonwhite and two-thirds were under age 50. More than half of those who didn’t vote earned less than $30,000 a year; more than half of those who did vote were over age 50.


Pew’s data allows us to see very specifically how voter turnout and candidate support compare. By looking at the preferred candidate in a demographic group and then comparing the density of that group in the population that voted with the density in the nonvoting population, we get a sense for how nonvoters determined the 2016 results.

We’ll start simply. Women tended to prefer Clinton to Trump and made up a higher percentage of the voting population than the nonvoting population. That split alone helps explain Clinton’s popular-vote victory.


But “women” contains multitudes. Black, working-class Democratic women; white, wealthy Republican women. The split by party shows how that makes a difference: Republicans made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool and, unsurprisingly, broadly supported Trump.


(Remember: We’re not comparing actual turnout to the pool of registered voters — we’re comparing percent of voters to percent of nonvoters. In a world where voting doesn’t vary by demographic, the percent of voters from any group would be the same as that group’s percentage of nonvoters. If a demographic group votes less than another, though, it will be below the centerline while the other group is above it.)

Looking at race and ethnicity, we see how the heavier turnout of white voters affected the contest. Black and Hispanic voters voted much more heavily Democratic than white votes backed Trump, but they turned out less.


While half of nonvoters were white, 74 percent of voters were.

An even more dramatic example of that comes when we look at age groups.


People under 30 preferred Clinton by 30 points but made up much more of the nonvoter population than the population that actually voted. A third of nonvoters were under 30; only 1 in 8 voters was in that age group.

Here’s what the income divide in Pew’s chart looks like.


Each of these demographic groups contains fragments of the others, of course. Some of those earning under $30,000 in income are Republican or black or female. If we overlap race and income, the dots above separate a bit.


Whites making more than $30,000 a year skewed Republican and made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool. Poorer whites and nonwhites generally made up more of the nonvoter pool than the voter pool.

Income and education generally correlate, but the chart looking at education and race is remarkably different from the chart above. College graduates leaned toward Clinton — but whites without college degrees voted heavily for Trump. Nonwhites without a college education were 40 percent of the nonvoter pool and only 1 in 5 actual voters.


Evangelicals were the most strongly pro-Trump of the religious groups of voters, and they represented more of the voting pool than the nonvoting pool. Black Protestants and Hispanic Catholics made up less of the voting population than the nonvoting population — and strongly preferred Clinton.


If we step back and look at the bigger picture — all the demographic data points from Pew’s analysis, including those above — the expected trend emerges.


Demographic groups that preferred Trump were three times as likely to be a bigger part of the voter pool than nonvoters. Among groups that preferred Clinton, they were about 50 percent more likely to be a bigger part of the nonvoting community.

Clinton nonetheless won the popular vote. But an increased turnout of under-30 voters in, say, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan could easily have changed the results of the history.",ostrich_semen,e406ba8,hillaryclinton

One party negotiated a deal with Iran to arrest their nuclear program and avoid war, the other is tearing it down. One permitted trans people to list their proper gender on their passport, the other wants to remove gay marriage and permit discrimination. One party passed the motor voter law, the other seeks to restrict access to the ballot.

"**Exhibit A: Russia's disinformation campaign**

""By one estimate, the Russians reached 126 million people on Facebook alone. And the kind of phony stories that they spread, claiming for example, that the Pope endorsed Donald Trump or that Hillary Clinton dealt arms to ISIS, those kinds of fake news stories actually had more social engagement and reached more readers than legitimate stories in the last three months of the campaign.""  

**Exhibit B: Russia's hacking of voter rolls**

""They penetrated voter rolls in at least 39 states. And we know from what the Senate Intelligence Committee said that in a small number of states, but possibly pivotal number of states, they changed the voter rolls, potentially disenfranchising Clinton voters who might have showed up to the polls and found out that they were not registered to vote.""

**~ ~ ""All of these things add up quickly in an election that was decided by fewer than 80,000 votes in three states."" ~ ~**

**Exhibit C: Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign** 

""The Russians began leaking these massive dumps of stolen emails through WikiLeaks on the eve of the Democratic convention, and the story line that emerged from those stolen emails was the the DNC was biased against Bernie Sanders. And then the next big tranche of documents was released, very significantly, 29 minutes after the Washington Post reported on the Access Hollywood video in which Donald Trump was heard bragging about grabbing woman by their genitals. And so that last-minute intervention by the Russians via WikiLeaks was incredibly important, which is why Donald Trump mentioned WikiLeaks 164 times in the last month of the campaign. 

~ ~""Nobody would suggest that the Russian intervention was the only factor behind the election outcome, but if you talk to experts like **former FBI agent Clint Watts, what he will tell you is that if it were not for the Russian intervention, Donald Trump would not have been within even striking distance of Hillary Clinton.**

**""I think we have great cause to fear for the security of our elections in 2018 and 2020.** Donald Trump benefited from the Russian intervention in 2016, Donald Trump probably would not be president if it weren't for the Russian intervention in 2016, and he shows very little interest in opposing the Russians."" ~ ~",BumBiddlyBiddlyBum,e3q8h8e,hillaryclinton

The problem is that the election was decided by an electoral college that is in no way recognizable to the spirit of what the college is supposed to be.

"I don't think that's at all true. Think about the United States when the Constitution was being written: A bunch of states worried about what it means to give up their sovereignty. The small states wouldn't have joined without assurances that they would continue to have a say in how the nation is run. For example, the New Jersey delegation's proposal had the President elected by a Congress where each state received one equal vote. The drafters of the Connecticut compromise (basically the system we have today) was very well aware that the electoral college it created would serve to ensure a geographically diverse national support for a presidential candidate. 

It serves that purpose quite well. If you imagine an election with two presidential candidates, where each gets 50% +1 votes in each state they win, the most lopsided scenario possible where one candidate wins the electoral vote without the popular vote still has the winner earning 49.6% of the vote.

2016 changed things. In 2016 she was receiving classified briefings that confirmed what her campaign was seeing: they were being hacked by Russia. US intelligence communities were putting out official statements—though not largely covered—that stated Russia was working to thwart her campaign.

Would there be direct evidence?  In a well-run setup, possibly. Depends on how good the hackers were.

In almost any of these setups?  Fuck no.  

All the circumstantial evidence others are complaining about is *probably* the best the public's gonna get.  I can't speak to legal status, but in the tech world, the evidence Michael Harriot laid out in this piece is more than enough to answer the kinds of questions we tend to have.  Those questions boil down to essentially one:

Given the available metadata (logs, audit trails, system monitoring histograms, diffs between backups and live data, etc), *can we trust that this system wasn't tampered with*?

That question itself is generally made up of two smaller ones:  What *do* we know? and What *can* we know?  I almost started basically typing out the article in my own words, but I'll skip that part.  Between how badly-secured these systems were (both design and implementation, and all the way from end-user to database backends), how badly audited and logged they were, and how badly backups were kept (if any), I think most competent professionals would generally agree on these points:

* We know attackers gained access to live voting systems/databases

* We know end-user voting machines are embarrassingly easy to gain access to.

* Due to bad security practices of many kinds, and in at least one case deliberate deletion of backups, *it is not possible* to verify whether or not data was changed in many of these cases.

In the computer security world, if you can't verify something, being thorough means you must assume the worst-case scenario.  How you deal with it depends a lot on context but to stay focused: This means that we as technical professionals *must* assume rolls and votes were tampered with.

The malfeasance and incompetence continually demonstrated over the course of the last two decades or so of modern electronic voting in the US has the general public in a position where anyone with a strong enough political lean can accept or dismiss the available data as they wish.  The pattern-matcher in me wants to think that's on purpose but that's neither here nor there.

As an industry expert, the 'case' presented in this article is highly convincing.  ""Can we trust that these systems were not tampered with?""  No, full stop.  Will we ever have *direct* evidence that votes were changed? Given the mismanagement involved, I very strongly doubt that.  Is that enough for a legal case? I have no idea. If I were brought in to fix the situation? This is more than enough.",tuba_man,e3537y7,hillaryclinton
"I wanna do this as a separate point cuz I talked too long already on the other one:

What standards of evidence do we need?  Well, what's our part in it and what action are we taking?

* Law enforcement/investigation: The available circumstantial evidence is more than enough to point to the suspects they already have.

* Prosecution: I imagine this needs to be pretty airtight, so we'll see.  Again, not a legal expert.

* As a policymaker: We already should be nowhere near this shitshow. The available evidence both for this past election and the trend over the last twenty years is enough that much stronger regulation *and enforcement* should have place ages ago.

* As a member of the general public: Speaking as a professional in this field, the evidence presented in this article is more than enough for me to continue under the assumption that voting and election data was tampered with in some way.",tuba_man,e353uup,hillaryclinton

If Trump got 20 votes and Clinton got 5 in a huge precinct, that's a lot of dark red splashed across the map.  And given that the electoral college is based on vote totals for the entire state (with slight exceptions in NE and ME), it doesn't actually matter how many precincts each candidate won.

I wish this were set up like the [population dot map](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/) so that all those huge areas in the midwest and west where no one lives would LOOK like no one lives there.

"It is still hard to read articles like this. 

One thing that has always seemed strange to me about WI is the fact that Ron Johnson beat Russ Feingold along with trump winning. I know Johnoson was the incumbent , but Feingold is a former senator , well known, and there was no reason he wouldn't have had support of lefties who refused to vote for Clinton and voted for Stein. If Clinton + Stein voters had more votes than trump, why didn't Feingold win? I've never taken a deep dive into the numbers . Did Stein voters not bother to vote in the Senate race? That senate race made even less sense to me than trump's victory here. Without going full blown conspiracy theory I always have thought that should factor into the equation when investigating WI. WI did have a known voter data breach that the state GOP downplayed. ",wi_voter,e318lv8,hillaryclinton
">Hillary Clinton lost the presidency not only because of the anti-Obama backlash, but also because we Democrats went slack, then did what we so often do — we fought among ourselves.



>Granted, Russia helped Trump. It may even have been the difference when you look at how close the vote was in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida that put Trump over the top.



>But every Berniecrat who couldn’t get over it, every Democrat who saw the election as the choice of two evils and sat it out, every unengaged citizen who didn’t engage — they contributed to our arrival at the point where everything we’ve gained since Brown vs. Board of Education is at risk.

",FrankieGH,e2z9hj1,hillaryclinton
"That is suspicious. If I had to take a guess, there might have been some folks who went in to vote for Stein without bothering with the lower parts of the ticket.

Then again, I'd imagine some normally-Republican voters who voted for Johnson would also pick Hillary out of disgust with Trump, pick Mr. Where's Aleppo, or just leave the top of the ticket blank.",LexPlex9000,e347312,hillaryclinton
YES.  THAT IS WHY IT DIDN'T GO WELL.  The far left and the purists still won't recognize their part in making Trump president and just like to pin it all on Hillary.,kerryfinchelhillary,e2z9y5y,hillaryclinton

You have told us that the only way to combat your hate fueled war on us is to raise our voices—loudly—and to protest and organize with everything we have.

If they didn't succeed with those hearings in front of a GOP congress and Senate then they certainly wouldn't have success if she were in office even with a GOP house and Senate. 

It was just posturing to deter the lazy independents and skeptical moderate republicans.

And then think about this, would McConnel and the GOP with a majority in the house and the senate really waste time trying to impeach Hillary when all it would result in would be Tim Kaine become president? That means they would effectively waste 2 years of house and senate majority achieving nothing.

"It sickens me to keep repeating this, but Trump was already talking about how the election was ""rigged"" (thanks Bernie!) and he would contest it if he lost.  The last thing we'd need would be for Obama to give him the excuse.

Everyone talks about Russia, Comey, the emails, etc.

But the fact is that if the state-level pollsters had gotten things right, then everyone wouldn't have assumed Hillary was going to win regardless of all these things.

If the race was seen to be closer, then maybe Comey would have avoided making his 11th hour email announcements (or equally announced the Trump-Russian investigation) and Hillary could have put more effort into the states she assumed she was going to win.

When Obama spoke to the people, he assured us our elections couldn’t be messed with - call it rigging, influencing, hacking, or something else, but the bottom line is that he was quite confident it was impossible and told American voters so, while in private he knew that Russians were in fact rigging/influencing/hacking. Very dishonest.

> their candidate's shortcomings is because they're anti-abortion.

You know what I'm starting to think?  
I'm starting to think we should just lie to them.  

The New York Times is keeping track of Donald Trump's lies, he broke quadruple digits a long time ago, I believe.  (Don't remember the number, but it's not small.)  Anyway, he goes on Fox and lies, he lies on twitter, he lies at pressers, and nobody on the right gives a shit.  When Fox News points out a lie, Fox News ratings go down.  
  
So fuck it, why don't we just run a Presidential candidate who goes out there and says: 

>""You know what, I'm pro-life as fuck, life begins at attention, and anyone who says otherwise is a communist.  Also I believe in Medicare for All and a $21/hr federal minimum wage phased in over my four year term.  Also I shoot lots of guns all the time, just for the fun of it, big ones too.""  *wink wink*
  
The Republican *voters* wouldn't notice the middle part, just the bits at the beginning and the end.  Hell, Donald Trump once said that the Government should pay for your health care, because ""well someone has to do it.""  They didn't care, they were pro-public health care that week, to the left of Bernie if it meant aligning with Trump.  
  
We run our candidate, and we just lie, say whatever they want to hear (while winking at our base the whole time), then govern however we want to govern.  When they ask us questions about why we're expanding abortion rights, we'll just keep lying.  
  
>""Wait... President Effort, this would nullify all the trap laws in the nation!!""  
  
>""No it wouldn't.""  
  
>""It's called the 2020 Trap Law Nullification Act.""  
  
>""No it's not.""  
  
>""But Fox News is saying that the 2020 Trap Law Nullification Act will nullify trap laws nationwide!""  
  
>""Fox News is lying to you.""  
  
>*""Planned Parenthood is building a 60' tall granite sculpture in your honor, the plaque reads 'The day trap laws were nullified nationwide by President Effort's 2020 Trap Law Nullification Act,' and quotes you saying how pleased you were that trap laws were a thing of the past, and you were proud to have nullified them!!!""*  
  
>""Anyone who's seen my record knows that I am no friend of Planned Parenthood.""  
  
>""Your record says that you dramatically increased their public funding.""  
  
>""That's the wrong record.""
  
Then we just win!  I guess.  
  
If lying to the voters meant that we elected a President and a Congress that would act against climate change, would it be worth it?  Let's not mince words here, Democratic policies save lives, if the past eight years of fumbling through Obamacare had proved anything, it's proven that.  With that in mind, how many lives could we save if we did what the Republicans were doing?  Gerrymandering the states, unbalancing the judicial bench, targeted election laws... okay that last one feels gross... but you get the picture.  
  
We always think about the worst case scenario, but let's ask ourselves about the best case this one time: How much practical good could eight years of dedicated Democratic governance do for this nation?  Hell, I'll be arrogant, how much good could it do for the *planet?*  
  
Health care, wages, research and development, labor laws, financial regulations, tax justice, environmental protections.... we could use the tax code to incentive vaccine research, and federal revenues to fund promising-but-not-profitable technology.  We could save lives, and improve the quality of the lives we saved, not just for ourselves, but for the world.  
  
If we lied.

Confirmation bias is universal, y' know?  

So I decided to check it out.  This synopsis is courtesy of Hamilton 68:  
  
>*[The #walkaway movement, a campaign highlighting alleged discord among the left, got a boost this week from accounts linked to Russian influence operations. The first use of the #walkaway hashtag from accounts monitored on Hamilton 68 was noted in early June (a few weeks after the grassroots campaign began), but engagement remained relatively low throughout the month. Activity spiked on July 2, when Hamilton 68 noted 73 unique tweets using #walkaway, and roughly another 50 using related campaign hashtags (e.g. #walkawaymovement). The late engagement suggests Kremlin-oriented accounts are trailers rather than leaders of the campaign, but the high-level of current engagement indicates an effort to astroturf support for the movement and hijack the narrative. This includes several monitored accounts that have changed their handles to include the hashtag, or that have shared their own supposed walkaway moments. The campaign also received a direct boost from Russian propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik, both of which ran stories on the movement.](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/)*   
  
Keep your eyes out for attempts to divide our movement, and our party, in ways both blatant and subtle.  *We lost the 2016 by 80,000 votes,* less than a football stadium, we can't afford to be at anything less than full strength this year.  A moment's foray into r/WalkAway should tell the average user everything they need to know about the movement.
  
If you see someone using WalkAway talking points around social media, take the time to disarm them.  I'm still hearing people talking about the ""rigged primaries,"" a talking point that was [disproven](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/14/16640082/donna-brazile-warren-bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-rigged), so either Russia is playing its greatest hits, or people still believe it, or both.  
  
Our enemies will be pushing back at us just as hard as they did in 2016, and if they're smart they'll push back *even harder* now that they have an entire political party on their side, but we know what we're looking for, and how to defend against it.

There's been a lot of that.  Trump really fucked with the fabric of our nation.

That same day my grandmother wrote a letter back, outlining the importance of the word of Christ, the 10 Commandments, and how little her ministers knew about what it means to be Christian.  
  
I'm pretty sure they got a lot of letters like that, because she got another letter next week, begging her and everyone else to come back.

Hillary Clinton was right - and warned us - about A LOT of things.,kerryfinchelhillary,e2kjsnb,hillaryclinton
"**Hillary Clinton was exactly right about Trump being Putin's puppet**

She tweeted, ""Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?""

Cue the flame emoji for a serious political social media burn.

Regardless of whether Clinton expected an answer to her tweeted question, she got one. The President of the United States clearly demonstrated to the world exactly which team he plays for: Russia.

""I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,"" Trump said at a news conference with Putin, regarding his belief that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

His message could not have been clearer: I trust what Putin tells me, despite what the US intelligence community uncovers about Russian election meddling.

Trump has been bashing the US intelligence community from day one of his presidency, famously labeling the Russia investigations as a ""witch hunt,"" and very publicly feuding with the FBI.

And Trump continues to be dismissive of them even now, despite the comprehensive report by the CIA, NSA, FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, all concluding with ""high confidence"" that there was Russian interference during the 2016 presidential campaign.

It may seem that Hillary Clinton's tweet predicted a disappointing display of Trump's allegiance to Putin, but Trump may just have fulfilled a prophecy that Clinton made before he was even elected president.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton famously called out Trump, implying that he would be Putin's ""puppet.""

""You encouraged espionage against our people. You are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list: break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do,"" Clinton said. ""You continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race.""

And she was right. Trump's clear anti-NATO remarks have generally aligned with Russia's sentiment about the organization; his expressions of admiration for Putin have played right into the Russian leader's hand.

And then came the fated Trump-Putin summit, and Trump's failure to condemn Russia for the coordinated cyberattacks during the 2016 presidential campaigns. This was particularly bold given that just last week, the Justice Department announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officials for interference in the election. Trump has, once again, proven that Clinton's prediction was spot on.

Heck, there's even a #SheWarnedUs hashtag on Twitter documenting all the times Hillary told us how the Trump presidency would pretty much unfold from the get-go.

With Trump's track record, there was no reason to believe Trump would not, once again, take Russia's side.

After today's press conference, Democrats and Republicans are both speaking out against Trump's comments, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stating that ""there is no question that Russia interfered in our elections,"" and acknowledging the need to recognize that Russia ""is not our ally.""

John Brennan, the former CIA director labeled Trump's comments ""nothing short of treasonous.""

As members of both parties distance themselves from the President's comments on Putin and are largely still absorbing the shock of having an American president openly side with and embrace a known adversary of his country, the one glaring truth we must all accept is that it was possible to see this coming. And Hillary Clinton did.

After witnessing the summit, Clinton herself had tweeted a response to her initial question: ""Well, now we know,"" the tweet read.

She knew all along which team Trump would play on -- and by now we should, too.

I sadly think the nation will treat her just as insanely as they did Clinton, but that will mean we as a society can no longer use Clinton as a scapegoat for our collective misogyny and we'd have to admit that we treat female candidates differently.

Donald Trump wouldn't have beaten any other candidate? You know that for a fact right? You know that cause Bernie was scrutinized by the right and Fox News? 

The truth, which is difficult for Fox News, GOP and Bernie Bros to accept, is that Hillary's loss didn't reflect the will of the majority of the country. Her loss was because of a flawed system.

"I am moderate but I don't mind seeing people like Cortez bringing their ideas to congress. It's easy to be conservative if you feel like your and your family's future is relatively stable , but ideas like democratic socialism take hold because their is a wide swath of people who do not feel comfortable with their present or future. This brings their voice to the table. I don't agree with everything and on some points I probably actually lean conservative. Take paid family leave for instance. I've had 2 kids and certainly that would have been more than helpful to get us through those early days. But I can look at the issue from the other side and see what would happen to school districts or certain healthcare organizations that are already barely keeping themselves above water if they had to suddenly provide for this expense. An idea that helps working families in one area is suddenly hurting kids in the classroom, because it is not just the Googles of the world that would have to abide by a paid family leave law.

And for the record, HILLARY BEAT BERNIE BY A FEW MILLION VOTES IN THE PRIMARIES.  And I can't speak for all Hillary supporters, but I hate Bernie because he's basically a left wing version of Trump - full of hatred and anger, has a huge cult that will go to great lengths to defend him, constantly trashing the establishment and corporations (politics is an expensive business and not everyone is like Trump and can pay for it all themselves), trying to run for president in a party he wasn't involved with (and that Bernie attacks every opportunity he gets), over the top plans that are unrealistic and that aren't fully detailed, want to be president despite never doing anything of substance in politics and seeming to be in it because they want the title and prestige more than anything.  Bernie never did anything of substance in Congress.  People like Trump and Bernie claim to hate the establishment, but what they really hated was that there were people who had more power than they do.  They complain about corporate donations, but like I said, politics is expensive and most people can't do it all themselves.  Just don't let who gives you money direct what decisions you make.",kerryfinchelhillary,e1v755s,hillaryclinton
I don’t know about that. I didn’t vote for Bernie in the primary. And a lot of what you said is true. But I don’t see it as his fault. He wasn’t the one claiming it was rigged. It was people like his jack ass campaign manager who complained about it being rigged. I like that Bernie is a senator and he has a more important voice than he did. I do hate the nasty rhetoric against Hillary to this day and will follow us until after she dies.

My educated guess is they exclude liberal voices because that is what their donors want. Makes it easier for them to get the legislation hand-crafted for themselves. They pay people to come up with the plans for that exclusion. It's not like all of the gerrymandering that went on in 2011 was the result of the legislators thinking up those things themselves.

It is kind of offensive that someone would suggest the more progressive democrats are a wedge that can be used to peel off some more support for this Republican party.

And honestly I don't see why any decent person would remain associated with Republicans at any level. It's not like local government happens in a vacuum.

"Her campaign in the general didn't advertise in the Rust Belt until days before she lost to Trump. Her advertising in the general almost totally ignored policy, and the vast majority of her ads almost exclusively focused on ad-hominem attacks and Trumps unfitness for office. Which no other political campaign in advertising history has done to the degree her campaign did.

Trumps campaign, in contrast, stuck to a more traditional advertising strategy of comparing and contrasting policy.

So considering the vast, vast majority of Sanders voters voted for Hillary in the general I think I'm gonna have to point more towards a bad general campaign and a historically weird advertising strategy than anything involving Sanders as a primary cause of her loss.

They should of just stuck with the tried and true method of compare and contrast advertising like she did in the primary against Sanders. But instead they gambled on a novel advertising strategy against Trump, and lost.

True, but at the same time, it doesn't do any good to be so close-minded in local govt. Tbh, I hate it when local govt candidates even label themselves as rep or dem unless it's just for political sway....which IS the whole reason for campaigning. But still, sometimes local govts get really bloated or get pigeonholed for no other reason than being a certain label.

"Yeah that's a very one sided and unfair assessment.

The facts are that all her major policy speeches were ignored by the media, which was entirely obsessed with the emails.

Did Sanders contribute to her loss? Yeah you're damn right he did.
When it was all too clear he had lost (after NY and especially after CA) he didnt concede but started to lie to his supporters he could still persuade the supers to vote his way, which was an outright lie.
For over  1,5 months he continued to attack Clinton and the DNC, all but preparing his supporters for the Wikileaks dump days before the convention.

By then his supporters had been convinced BY SANDERS that the DNC had rigged the primaries against him (he used the same rhetoric as trump btw) and they were ripe for wikileaks to ratfuck the left.

And afterwards? Did he really campaign for Hillary as he claimed?
Nope.
I saw his Hillary events: whenever he mentioned her name the crowds booed and he smiled, after which he diverted to his usual stump speeches.

In the 3 months Wikileaks started to dump the Podesta mails, did he ever address his supporters and warn them his own campaign emails wouldnt have looked very much different?

Did he ever warn his supporters Russia was playing them (while he now claims he knew?)?

He's a bitter POS who wanted Hillary to lose and who was planning his 2020 run instead of fighting trump.

That doesnt mean Hillary didnt make mistakes btw, her advertising and her general campaign relied too much on the old ways/ old methods, sure. But seeing how she still won by 3 million voted, Im pretty sure a strong Sanders support from after the CA primary would and could have made all the difference.

"I didn't say her campaign in the general relied too heavily on the ""old ways"" I said basically the exact opposite.

As is outlined in those studies I linked, her campaign used a novel and never before seen advertising strategy in the general that virtually ignored policy based ads and instead focused almost entirely on ad hominem attacks on Trump and his fitness for office.

It's true that Trump isn't fit for office for a lot of reasons, but you should probably also run policy based ads too so people know what you're gonna do as president.

All the more so when the media is ignoring the speeches you're giving about policy, and not many people watch the news to begin with.

"I would never argue she made no mistakes.

In fact, I can list a few more.:P

Now the question is: can you admit Bernie made a huge mistake too?

The key moment in 2016 was imo the morning after Bernie lost the CA primary.

You may remember that rather dramatic moment. The whole press and every politically interested man/ woman was waiting for him to admit defeat, endorse Hillary and go to work.
Not with a huge chip on his shoulder but enthusiastically.

He didnt.
Instead he spoke about how he'd still win, and launched a huge attack on both Hillary and the DNC.

He continued that for 5 full weeks afterwards.
Those 5 weeks are key. They gave us a time period in which Bernie and trump double teamed in their attacks on Hillary.

He created an illusion among his followers he could still win the primaries (which he couldn’t) making their disappointment bigger and bigger.

And then we saw the melodrama at the convention where Bernie’s supporters (not all but a lot) behaved like complete and total scum.
Booing John Lewis? Booing the mothers of the movement?
Booing any POC they could?

Sitting there with their mouths taped and playing the spoiled disgusting drama queens they were?

The months afterwards, I made the silly decision to start working for Our Revolution as a kind of peace offering. I worked on the campaigns of Jayapal and Teachout.
Not a single fucking Berner wanted to work on those campaigns, instead they obsessed over wikileaks and their immature hatred of the woman that won and the dem party.

On the day before the election I wrote a deeply felt passionate plea to the Bernie subs here on reddit begging them to vote for Hillary.
If not for themselves, for minorities, for women, children, Muslims, poc, lgtb.
I warned them how much trump would hurt us.

I was laughed at, yelled at, scorned and ridiculed by the entitled, privileged scumbags who call themselves Bernieorbusters.

And now, we see everything happen that Hillary and we warned for.
Women, poc, lgtb, children are hurting. 
And you or any other Bernie supporter who voted for Hillary are ok, but do not question that :yes Bernie did enormous damage to Hillary's campaign.

He should have campaigned for her from the CA primary on. Should not have taken a leave to write his damn book and most of all: he should have addressed his spoiled privileged supporters not once but over and over again to talk some sense into them about wikileaks, Russian meddling (bots promoting Bernie) and so on and on.

And Jane Sanders should go to hell for her tweet when Bernie endorsed Hillary and told his supporters to vote for her, they shouldn’t always follow/ do what Bernie told them to….


",Danie2009,e24ouvi,hillaryclinton
"Sure I guess some of those were mistakes. But a statistically insignificant drop in an ocean of people who did not vote for her is hardly a reason to hate somebodies guts or damn them to hell. 

By the way some of your claims about Bernie not frequently or forcefully telling his voters to vote for Hillary when he started campaigning for her are demonstrably not true. And even Hillary said he was an effective and hardworking campaigner for her after the primary, in her book.

Oh and if Bernie holding out for so long was so influential to her losing then why was she so far ahead of Trump up until a few weeks before the election?

What opposition did you expect to find? Who were you trying to convince?

Climate Change- We both can cite numerous academics that agree with our positions, but there is still plenty of debate going on about the extent of our effect on the planet. [HERE] (https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/climate-change-no-its-not-97-percent-consensus-ian-tuttle/) is a right leaning website that explains a few skepticisms about how ""certain"" scientists are.

Furthermore, your original complaint expressed your discontent with Republicans not voting to support the widely accepted views of climate change. However, the Pew Poll you referenced answered your own question it the numbers when it said, ""74% of Republicans and Independents who lean Republican believe it is possible to cut regulations and protect the quality of air and water..."" I think sometimes Reps get painted as not caring about the environment, which isn't true (according to this study). They just have a lot of confidence that there is another way to take care of the issue than target certain industries and jobs (coal specifically). 

Gun Control- The Gallup Poll you referenced was also comical. You are 100% right that the survey participants support stricter gun laws. Where it gets funny is where they suggest what regulations would work and which ones wouldn't. All the suggested prevention methods that are widely considered effective are laws we ALREADY have on the books. The 3 at the bottom where a true divide starts to take place are laws that have been proposed by Dems but never approved on a federal level. It would be logical to conclude that the Gallup Poll, taken only a month after the Parkland shooting, might be emotionally driven. If everybody says more needs to be done, but then they only promote laws that already exists, it could just be honest-to-goodness frustration and sadness. Not to mention the fact that only 42% of people reported owning a gun. Everybody seems to have an opinion, but only 42% of them actually know what they are talking about. 

As far as the next few topics you brought up, I believe you told me to shut up, typed out childish sounds, and then became self-conscious about the aesthetics of your post. Maybe you can forward that nonsense onto all the people who think like you do in this sub.
",HoochieKooch,e1qsc2x,hillaryclinton
"I am still a scientist, and I can tell you that media talking about science is always a little iffy. However, you didn’t use some trusted media source that has issues understanding complex topics. You used the National Review. The national review is not even a source you should use to other conservatives. Might as well be using fucking Breitbart or InfoWars. Also, you ignored every part of my statement. My statement wasn’t saying there was a right or wrong answer to anything (although there factually is), just that the opinions of republican politicians  all appear to be minority opinions. And they are. Based on all of my sources. That are actual polls. Based in actual fact. I am in this community and I support democrats because I support actual facts with proof. Not some shit that national review can scrape off the road and act like is fact. ",bicatlantis7,e1qt5fe,hillaryclinton
"Let's be honest, you are the one disagreeing with a source because of its name and not because of its arguments. I actually looked at the sources you sent me and raised questions about the conclusions you arrived at. If you have a problem with the National Review's logic, I'd happily listen and consider it. This is why I really only referenced the sources you promoted. If you're just going to push out your bottom lip and take your ball home, I guess the conversation was never worth having to begin with because you were never going to evaluate an opposing idea honestly. 

Additionally, any reasonable scientist would agree to the idea that there are plenty of complex ideas that science struggles to understand. They would also know that the qualitative reporting of surveys and polls of opinion do not substitute as empirical evidence to be used in solving major inquiries. ",HoochieKooch,e1qu710,hillaryclinton
"I don’t understand what you’re getting at? I’m never going to take national review seriously and neither should you. They lie in a partisan way and spread falsehoods. Whatever truths they use are then abused to spread other falsehoods. I’m not about to use whatever r/atheism writes as an argument for anything because even if they are right there are better sources. But now we get to talk about my favorite thing, statistics and what they represent!!!! Let’s go! No joke, I really love talking about statistics. Anyway, there is no such thing as a perfectly designed survey. Look at the infamous readers digest Truman/Dewey poll. And  all polls have issues. But the best polls by the best polling companies usually take that into consideration. An example of a definite issue with one of my polls, the gun survey, is that it is a survey and the only people who would willingly do the survey are people with stating opinions. However, that doesn’t mean they are wrong. In poll after poll it has been shown that people overwhelmingly support gun control. Poll. After. Poll. After. Poll. I would add sources. Just google pew, Gallup, cnn, Fox News, all are solid polling companies (CNN and fox are independent of they’re journalism, you don’t have to worry about any tilt) and all show it. 
There definitely are times where you probably shouldn’t rely on polls. We can calculate the margin of error pretty easily on those. Like my pew poll that you didn’t like the labeling of my link to. That showed 49:48 for treating gay people with respect. That’s well within the margin of error. And I don’t take that at face value. It could go either way. 
Basically maybe you have a point, but we have to trust when data is all saying the same thing over and over again. ",bicatlantis7,e1qvakw,hillaryclinton

Watching our current sheriff politely remind people of general traffic and safety tips on the news I can't help but remember to be grateful that we no longer have Ten Gallon asshat David Clarke here in Milwaukee County.

Also, 90% of Republicans are HAPPY with Trump.  That means 99.99% will vote for him because they understand what PARTY LOYALTY means and the importance of VOTING.

Plus they want someone presidential and dignified in the White House, and not a racist, sexist dirtbag of a human being who spews hate and divides us, telling the Boy Scoutsabout a red map instead of their civic duty, a slimeball who has more swamp in his Cabinet than the history of the country combined, who celebrates racist pigs in Charlottesville, and loves to talk about assaulting women because he is a celebrity.

"1. Since when was Trump anti-gay marriage?

2. There are already universal background checks on weapon purchases, get informed instead of repeating what you hear from others.

3. Many, many Americans are for children’s right to live, and feel the phrase “reproductive rights” is disingenuous, seeing as we’re ignoring the fact that abortion is infanticide.

4. Parent-child separation was signed in by Bill Clinton. Trump just fixed that so in the they won’t be separated anymore.

5. Many Americans also don’t like Obamacare. So it’s not fair for 50% to like it and 50% to dislike it, but 100% being forced to have it.

6. Obama saved the economy? Are you fucking kidding me? Also, during Trump’s presidency unemployment is at an all time low, and the economy is thriving. Trump is a businessman, he knows the economy.

7. How is Trump racist or sexist? I hear this a lot with no claims to back this statement up. Funny to hear from the party of Jim Crow.",HarlandoRED,e210cqg,hillaryclinton

If you really think Trump has had anything to do with a $19 trillion economy in 16 months on the job, you don't understand anything.  Point 5, you don't understand ow insurance works.  Point 4, laughable. The children ripped from the parents under Trump's zero tolerance.  Point 3, yes I am in favor of women being able to choose to have an abortion.  Point 2, how about them gun shows!!!  love those background checks there!  Point 1, Trump is naming justices who will seek to overturn the gay marriage law.

All just my opinion, but the overgrown scrotum that is the leader of the Senate Majority has an iron grip on his party. If she’s openly opposing potential judicial nominees now without much backlash it’s because he’s letting her.

"You misunderstood my post completely.
I deeply despise Bernie exactly for this reason: when a Dem wins the primary: You support that Dem, period!

In other words: I support Ocasio-Cortez and ridicule the assumption in the press that Dems will lose the midterms because a socialist is running in a deep blue district.

"None of the strategies worked because they were barely covered compared to Trump. No one cared what Jeb!, Marco, or Ted Cruz were saying, the media was waiting breathless for Trump's response.

"> But this is how democracy works.

Except Trump wasn't democratically elected. He **lost** by nearly three million votes. If this was a democracy, he would be the loser. The only reason he ""won"" was because of an archaic system designed to preserve slavery, a system that is now more than a century and a half obsolete.

>I voted for a person who agreed with those positions

Trump doesn't agree with shit. He's a demagogue who changes his positions as often as his socks. He was pro-choice for years, defiantly so, giving money to pro-choice groups and candidates. And then, suddenly, he shifted his position to dupe poor fools like you.

"Well, directly before your quote, he states:
> It goes without saying that as we fight to end all forms of discrimination, as we fight to bring more and more women into the political process, Latinos, African Americans, Native Americans — all of that is enormously important, and count me in as somebody who wants to see that happen.

And then: 
> “Right now, we’ve made some progress in getting women into politics — I think we got 20 women in the Senate now. We need 50 women in the Senate. We need more African Americans.”

Only after this, hes says that being a Latina is ""not good enough"". And concludes:
> In other words, one of the struggles that you’re going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics.

So it is just wrong to say that he is dismissing identity polictics, in fact it reads to me as a approach of intersectionality. Ben Carson ist black, but not necessarily better for black people than an average white democrat. Same with Condoleezza Rice. And even though you dont like Bernie, he is more in favour of women rights, than Sarah Palin would have been as Vice-President... so clearly I have to agree: Being black, a latina/-o or a women is not enough. Clearly we want to have at least proportinate representation of all members of the society and thats why he said ""we need 50 women in the Senate"" and why he said that we ""need more African Americans"".. that clear to everyone on the left. He then says that we have to go BEYOND identity politics, not to dump or dismiss it, but go beyond it, in other words: add progressive politics to it.

For me its really simple: I support the one with the best ideas - is it an advantage if the one is a person who experience discrimination? Hell yeah, if there is a good women, I'll take her over the men. A good black person, I take him or her over the white one and same for homosexuals and transgender. But still, having this attribute alone is not enough, I have to agree with the politics .. thats why I supported Bernie Sanders and not Hillary Clinton. If Elizabeth Warren would have been in the race, I would have routed for her and would have been angry at Bernie for not withdrawing and supporting her. And yeah.. if a black politician who has good politics would have been in the primaries I would have supported her and probably him.

He assumes that this lady, just because she identifies as Latino and is a woman, doesn't care about economic issues. That's his fallacy there - he can't see that someone who is a woman and a minority can also address economic issues.

>And even though you dont like Bernie, he is more in favour of women rights, than Sarah Palin would have been as Vice-President... so clearly I have to agree: Being black, a latina/-o or a women is not enough.

Why are you bringing up Sarah Palin like she's someone I'm using as a litmus test? Again, this is the problem with Bernie and his die-hards - he uses identity as a litmus test. I supported Hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. I didn't support Palin cause she was a woman. I don't admire Condoleeza cause she was a woman. You guys need to stop conflating gender in this way and behaving like support for a woman or a minority is just down to the identity.

And my problem with Bernie is exavctly this - he rails against identity politics yet he's the one who reduces his opponents to their identities. He did with Hillary and he's done it with other candidates he's run against in the past. And he's actively dismissed issues that concern women and minorities at the same time.

Hillary wasn't against single payer healthcare. She was just against Bernie's plan. Her plan built towards it.

She supported tuition-free college, ending private prisons and definitely for campaign finance reform.  

And by the way, one of Cortez's big issues is criminal justice reform which was also Hillary's. Not Bernie's. And also paid family leave. Again, another main issue on Hillary's platform. Not Bernie's.

How is that ""more than just false""? I'm talking about the actual words he said. Whereas what you're saying here:

Is completely skewed because his words aren't about being ""progressive"". And even if it was implied in the way you're revising it, it's still a dismissal of identity politics. Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 


>Than stop saying Bernie wants to dismiss identity politics because he says exactly the same that you just said

He's not saying the same thing, You'd like to think he's saying the same thing but he's not. How are you trying to twist this? Why is this so difficult to understand? You've even changed the meaning of what I said.... I supported her because she was a woman AND she supported progressive/liberal values,,, that's a whole package. That's not what Bernie said. Bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative. Maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a Latina woman. do you see the difference here?

>Would have been a lot more time efficient for both of us if you had said that earlier..

Why should I have to say that? You're the one, like Bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing. If you can't figure out that this is part of other people's views then y'all are the ones with the identity politics problem here.

He dismissed Trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction. And then there's his hardcore supporters coming after Hillary supporters as vagina voters.

And then you go back further... when he ran against a female governor of Vermont he made it about her gender and how it would be sexist to vote for her because she was a woman.

>  Because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to Bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. 

It might be that he thinks a lot more in terms of class than other politicians do (if they do it at all) because he says he is a socialist. But still he made clear quite a lot that racial and gender justice is really important (to him).

> Bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative.

Come on.. I am pretty sure Bernie knew Hillary Clinton from their time in Senate together.. 

> Maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a Latina woman.

He could have done that. But I don't know the centext.. I have searched for quite a bit but didn't found an article with the full question but I found one with the full (long) answer. Yes, he could simply have asked what she wants to change or whats to do and when she replied he could than have said ""okay, thats great"" or ""yeah, thats not enough"". But what he could also have done is say that it is really important go get enough minoritiy candidates into politics but they also have to be progressives. I don't see a problem there. (Even tough his statement beginns with ""Let me respond to the question in a way you may not be happy with"", so its probably more than ""I want to be the first latina.."" but a real question)

> You're the one, like Bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing.

Where am I beeing very arrogant? And where am I reducing identity politics as a negative thing?

> I mean Bernie called her unqualified and his campaign manager branded her ""ambitious"" because she wanted to run for president.

Bernie replied to her, when she said that Bernie didnt do his homework and that doesnt understand how to break up big banks and voters should ask themselves if he can deliver what he promises. Then Bernie just replied ""Theyre going to question my qualifications, so I am questioning theirs."" And he repeated the same in a debate (""you might wonder about your qaulifications Madame Secretary"". And then he said why he is questioning them: Iraq war, trade agreements, super PACs, Wall Street. Yes, this might be a bit childish (Bernie said that ""we"" shouldnt get into that tit-for-tat) but I dont think its sexist. 

It is basically ""being a women is not enough"" because you have to stand up against big banks and not take their money. And the ""ambitious"" thing is actually another context.. but okay, I am not here to say that every member of the campaign is perfect. But its a bit far-fetched to say that Bernie reduced Clinton to her identity because his campaign manager says, that she has ambitions to be president... thats basically a fact for (nearly) every candidate.

> He dismissed Trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction.

No he said that this is shameful and its probably not against Clinton but this would be against all women. A quote of the interview: ""Maybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing America. Donald Trump will not look quite so interesting in that context."" He is not saying, that abortion rights are not important (which is insane to say if you know his voting record and his engagement for women rights.

> And then there's his hardcore supporters coming after Hillary supporters as vagina voters.

And then there is the hardcore supporters of Hillary coming after Bernie supporters (but again Bernie supporters /=/ Bernie) who say that there is a special place in hell for women who dont support Clinton.

I guess then maybe we should reevaluate what ""progressive"" means cause if this is your view then most liberal democrats don't agree. If you think that the views of white male heterosexuals are more progressive than minorities  that's kind of questionable. Very questionable.

How is a minimum wage helping white people more than people of color? Aren't poc even more effected by it?,Bermany,e2coc1y,hillaryclinton
"Again, you're purposely refusing to see my point. Where did I say minimum wage helps white people more? Please point that out. I'm clearly saying that Bernie approaches it from one angle. He doesn't see that there are nuances affecting economic equality issues that concern race and gender. 

And to top it all, when he puts economic issues above social and civil rights issues, it's even more alienating to non-white voters. 

Living wage is definitely important but if you're a minority, you're more concerned about getting the job or having the same opportunity for the job as everyone else. Bernie's economics don't factor those issues. 

And if he cared so much about economic equality, then why hasn't he advocated more against voter suppression?

He refuses to discuss race and gender in terms of economics when it obviously plays a huge part. That's why his agenda is narrow and WWC specific.",FrankieGH,e2cqw33,hillaryclinton

Think the party is going to focus on what makes them good leaders and better policy? Right now their message is getting drowned out with all the anti trump attacks which seems like a losing strategy to wrestle with a pig in mud. ,duffmanhb,e12ejcp,hillaryclinton
Interesting. Hoping for the best for their endeavor.  Anytime I hear about cutting healthcare costs my muscles automatically tense because it invariably means lets cut healthcare staff and things are pretty tough already for healthcare professionals at every level. Let's hope they find some other innovations and don't end up gong down that path too. As it is I don't recommend my job in healthcare to young people anymore.,wi_voter,e12qpyt,hillaryclinton
"Are you missing the point that right now being a good leader and standing up for democrat policies is hand in hand with opposing Trump? So you want Democrats to talk about their policies while pretending that Trump isn't destroying the country? 

This is the same bullshit that got Trump elected. You don't like the message so you pretend there's none and let people like Trump get away with their shit. Fuck this shit. ",FrankieGH,e12ytan,hillaryclinton

"I never said it was binary.... It just seems like the predominate message is just anti-Trump... Like it's the message everyone is hearing first and beyond the loudest. 

Democrats tend to work towards things, rather than against things. Hence the whole ""progressive"" element of Democrats. 

Being against Trump is great, but we need to be based in ideas with our messaging.",duffmanhb,e12yynw,hillaryclinton
"And where exactly are democrats failing with the messaging? Healthcare? Immigration? Gun control. Right now the Democrats don't have the luxury to float their message like it's independent of Trump. What exactly have you heard from the Democrats that isn't progresive?  What are these messages? We're winning elections with the most diverse candidates handily and that's not on purely anti-Trump messaging.

But then again, if anti-Trump messaging is winning us seats, why shouldn't we continue? The most important thing is to win isn't it? I'd rather democrats win on anti-Trump than lose on purity tests that prolong Trump.

What exactly are democrats working against that is bad for progressive policies? Standing up to Trump is working towards progressive policies is it not?",FrankieGH,e12zmi6,hillaryclinton
"Does it ""seem that way"" or is it that way? I'm pretty immersed in news so maybe it's different for me, but I have absolutely no trouble talking about the policy positions of the democratic party as a whole nor most individual high profile democrats. It's really not difficult for me to understand the distinction between the Republicans, the status quo and the Democrats.

I dunno. What you're saying just sounds like cable news bs. Things pundits say to get through their required 2 minutes of saying stuff when they don't know what else to say. Has no real connection to reality.",smocca,e13d9e8,hillaryclinton
"See but most Americans don’t follow the news. You can say “oh but I know their policy and what they want. Anyone who looks into it can find it!” But most people wont. That’s not what the casual voter does. They live their lives and only listen to the end product of the general message. And as it stands now, the message most casual voters are hearing is just nothing but anti trump from the left. Basically anmessage of “vote for us because the GOP is scary!”",duffmanhb,e13fd1k,hillaryclinton
"Okay but no one is saying that. So what do you want exactly? It's like you're saying they shouldn't just be anti-Trump and when we say ""they're not and mostly talk about other stuff"" it's now just ""well people aren't hearing them."" Well, sorry. There's a narcissist with the office of the presidency and his own media empire. He's pretty good at getting attention. So yea people who don't pay enough attention only hear about Trump. I just don't see how that has to do with Democrats, their goals and their messages.

Hillary talked almost entirely about stuff other than Trump but out of an hour long speech the media would grab the few lines opposing Trump and play them endlessly. They do that because it gets ratings because people are infatuated with the narcissist. But unless you have a magic trick that fixes that problem I don't know what you want Democrats to do about it.

Further, half this country thinks stand-up comedians are like the PR department of democrats so when they make jokes about Trump they think all democrats talk about is Trump. I hardly hear my senators mention Trump's name unless they are taking specific actions to oppose a specific policy and they virtually always have an alternative. It's not their fault our media sucks.

Just look at all the benefit of the doubt Ivanka Trump gets. She's apparently against separating children from parents if you listen to the press. Yet she hasn't said one word publicly. They are going off a so-called conservation she had in private with Trump. Same with Melania. 

We should fight this perception of liberal bias and counter these narratives with questions. Instead we try to get rid of strong voices.

Hillary helped raise 500,000 recently. She can do more in her capacity and so can the Obama's. Just because they are perceived as toxic doesn't mean we bow down to the Republicans.

So unless she plans to run again in 2020, I see her and the DNC as a whole being fodder for the kremlinbots and the folks who follow them knowingly or unknowingly. 

She doesn't have *the it* that Bill and Barack had. She's smart and she was literally the *best prepared presidential candidate* since George fucking Washington and somehow the country elected the other guy. 

I really do feel bad for her - but it's time to get America back - another two years of Republican rule and that Supreme Court is gone for a generation. 

Think of the regulatory rollbacks, the financial crimes that will become legal, the expansion of Citizens United, etc. 

ALEC is going to have a field day and eventually 2/3 of the states will come together and try to modify the damned constitution in their *current image* - I mean I don't mean to sound hyperbolic but shit's real. ",fuckswithboats,e0uxu0h,hillaryclinton
"I really think you're just buying in 100&#37; to the conservative view of her. Not that you believe it, just the way you're framing it is exactly how they do and it's not the way most people see it. 

She is genuinely looked up to by millions of Americans. She is a role model for women (and not just women) around the world. She has the loyalty of extremely influential political groups because she has been a proven ally for decades.

Besides, that 1/3rd you're talking about are not who we need to be speaking to. They shouldn't be part of our conversation. It's not our job to heal the nation and bring everyone together.

Finally, it wasn't *somehow* that the country elected the other guy. It was an unprecedented series of headwinds. The FBI/Comey's bullshit. Russian disinformation campaigns. Cable news' infatuation with Trump. Misogyny. And yes she wasn't perfect too but the idea that there is ""just something about her"" is a Fox News invention. There are reasons the polls moved so dramatically in the last few weeks. Primarily it was Comey but also the conspiracy theories about her health and the way news networks failed.

Those things could have just as easily applied to other candidates. If you don't think Republicans are going to do all of that and more to the next candidate we pick, no matter who it is, then I'm sorry but you need to get better prepared because it is going to be worse next time.

I believed that, too. Until the 2016 election. Now I'm pretty sure the number of people who believe the crazy shit is much higher than the folks who adore Hillary.

>. If you don't think Republicans are going to do all of that and more to the next candidate we pick, no matter who it is, then I'm sorry but you need to get better prepared

The conditions these kids were kept in was still horrific and wrong. Keeping kids in cages with thin mattresses on concrete floors is disgusting. Doesn't matter if you buy them new clothes or whatever.

What has happened in the past year is that the use of this program was expanded to asylum seekers and used more aggressively with people entering the country illegally. In this way the cruelty has been compounded to a level that I frankly never imagined this country was capable of.. And given that multiple administration officials are on record as saying the purpose of this is to deter asylum seekers, I think we can assume they know it's cruel.

And here is the twisting of the narrative where y'all imply it's ""only"" about equal rights and use identity politics as a negative. And what are these transgressions? That's a pretty vague statement especially when you're saying that civil rights are secondary to the functionality of a political party. That's something.

> And that's not just my opinion, but it's the opinion of many many many voters. 

No one is disputing that's your opinion. But it's not the opinion of the majority of democrats. If that was the case and the majority of dems felt  the party had lost its way then Bernie would have won the primaries or at the least it would have been a close race but neither happened.

>A lot of long time Democratic voters switched and either voted for trump or a third party candidate and that should speak volumes to you.

Well this is yet another misrepresentation from you. Come on, if you're trying to make a point, be honest instead of making up things and trying to pass them off as facts just because you want to believe it.

>You have to learn to stop taking democratic criticisms against the party as personal attacks and look towards how you can make the party better and inclusive to everyone..

 Where exactly did I take anything as a ""personal attack""? This is exactly why Bernie Bros are so hated - as soon as someone calls out all the lies and misrepresentations y'all throw out, you hit back with condescension like this. It's a pretty low form of discourse.

It's pretty rich to lecture me and other democrats about making the party more inclusive when people like you are actively dismissing equal rights as a secondary issue. Yeah, let's be ""inclusive"" by focusing on one demographic. Tell me how you're being ""inclusive"" by dismissing equal rights and all the economic and humanitarian repercussions?

of course I'm going to post another rant. Do you really expect to lie and misrepresent and get away with it?

You don't have to agree with them \(or even just their timing\), but if you continue to dismiss the different voices in the party like this, the democratic party will continue to weaken and we will lose more elections to morons that we should have trounced.

THAT SAID: So you're blaming Bernie voters turning to Trump because they didn't like how their candidate was treated or acknowledged? REALLY?! That's fucking precious.  You're actually saying that Bernie voters voted for Trump over Hillary because they didn't feel catered to even though Hillary and the party changed the platform to accommodate Bernie?  And because of ""how long"" Bernie held progressives positions? I mean you're full of shit and don't even pretend you voted for Hillary.

Don't talk about dismissing voices when that's the reason Bernie lost and will continue to lose. Bernie cares only for white working class. He's not a democrat. And democrats are winning over Trump candidates because they're going against every thing Bernie preached.

"Maybe this is a weird thing to focus on, but this article was so oddly framed.  It feels like the writer was talking to an American for the first time and noting all the differences in language, rather than interviewing someone with a lot of wonderful things to say.

Of course Chelsea wouldn't say, for example, ""Well done,"" because that's a British colloquialism, and Chelsea is American.  I'm trying to think of an American equivalent, but we don't really have one, and I feel like that's because, ironically enough, that turn of phrase sounds incredibly condescending to my American ears. 

From what I gathered, the writer has a problem with Chelsea's American syntax, word choice, and construction, and uses that to chastise her for being too aloof.  I think the point the writer was trying to make, if I'm being generous, was that Chelsea is polished (and of course she is, as the writer pointed out, she's always been in the political spotlight), but then she (the writer) called her language clunky, which negates that point.  

I think Chelsea's extremely well-spoken, yes, just like her mother.  But, I'm sick of that being termed as cold, especially from foreign press who, in this case, doesn't seem to understand our speech patterns.

I did. How did I manage that? 

> And what does her husband's strategy have to do with her? 

Her campaign included good things she did as First Lady. If you read articles from the 1990s, they all call her the most politically-involved First Lady ever.

Alright, suppose I humor this angle of yours - what actions of her supporters during the campaign back up your claim that they were alienating others? I don't recall Hillary supporters attacking others publicly during the campaign like throwing money at Bernie supporters like they did to Hillary supporters. Provide some examples please.

\> **Her campaign included good things she did as First Lady.** If you read articles from the 1990s, they all call her the most politically-involved First Lady ever.

That was a tiny part of her campaign. Barely touched on it. You know why? Because she's done way more stuff beyond that. It's very clear that you don't even know what her campaign was about if you're reducing the sum total of it on how she was as a first lady. And despite that, you're still focusing and basing your judgment on how her husband governed.

This is a load of crap - you've been taken in by a 30-year right-wing (and left-wing, and Russian) smear campaign.

Hillary Clinton has been the subject of nearly three decades of endless partisan witchhunts and investigations, she released decades of tax returns, and the internal communications of her and her staff have been leaked for the world to pick through.

None of this deluge of information has produced a **single** actionable charge against her. Clinton has been infinitely more transparent and exposed than any other candidate in history.  

Despite all this, many (including you) assume she ""must be corrupt"" and that *""she has a lengthy history of questionable choices""*.

**Israeli Intelligence Firm’s Election-Meddling Analysis Comes Under Mueller’s Scrutiny**

*Psy-Group presentation outlines ways Trump campaign was helped by fake social media accounts*

By Byron Tau and  Rebecca Ballhaus

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators have obtained a presentation prepared by an Israel-based private intelligence firm that outlines ways in which Donald Trump’s 2016 election was helped by fake news and fake social-media accounts, according to people familiar with the presentation and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Mueller’s interest in the presentation suggests his investigation is focusing on the role of social-media manipulation during the 2016 campaign. Intelligence officials have said that cyber-influence campaigns, sometimes covertly sponsored by foreign governments, are expected to become a major part of political campaigning in the coming years.

The presentation consists of nine slides and was prepared by the Psy-Group, a firm that boasts of ties to elite Israeli intelligence agencies. It isn’t clear who received the Psy-Group presentation, but it appears to have been created sometime after the 2016 election.

People familiar with the presentation describe it as an internal analysis drawn up by the firm to drum up U.S. political business—saying that it was essentially used as marketing material for the firm’s operation and analytical capabilities. It also represents a “proof of concept” of how a firm like Psy-Group would have manipulated the 2016 campaign as well as future campaigns, people said.

It is unclear how much of the presentation consists of the firm’s analysis of online activity during the campaign and how much is a hypothetical pitch.

Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Mr. Zamel, said the presentation copy that Mr. Mueller has obtained was a “sample type analysis of what they could do.”

A spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment.

The presentation outlines the ways in which social media “bots” and fake online content were used to help energize voters supportive of Mr. Trump. One slide entitled “Trump Campaign Components” outlines a timeline where “fake news sites/avatars/content” were created during the early part of the election year and then leveraged to spread “uncertainty” by midyear. The final stage was “using fake bots to react to real life situations & further polarize the TA,” or target audience, the slide says.

Another slide says the firm identified 140 pro-Trump websites linked to a man in Macedonia. The websites “had American-sounding domain names such as WorldPoliticus.com” and “published aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the USA.” WorldPoliticus.com is no longer active.

A person familiar with Trump campaign’s operations said it has “absolutely no knowledge of what this firm was referring to” in the slideshow.

Another slide outlines a Facebook strategy where fake online profiles or “avatars” engage real people online and encourage them to share content. The result is a “multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies,” the slide says.

In September, Facebook disclosed that it identified about 500 “inauthentic” accounts with ties to Russia that bought $100,000 worth of ads during a two-year period encompassing the presidential campaign.

Mr. Mueller is investigating whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded in Russian efforts to interfere in the election. Moscow has denied meddling and Mr. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign.

The Psy-Group’s founder, Joel Zamel, is under scrutiny from U.S. investigators because of his close relationship with the government of the United Arab Emirates and his involvement in a meeting with Mr. Trump’s eldest son shortly before election day, the Journal has reported.

Mr. Zamel met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in the weeks before the 2016 election along with George Nader, a top adviser to the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, to discuss an offer to help boost the campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. Erik Prince, a U.S. defense contractor who specializes in the Middle East and had close ties to the campaign, attended the meeting, the Journal previously reported. People involved in the meeting say nothing came of it and the Psy-Group didn’t perform any work for the Trump campaign.

A lawyer for Mr. Trump Jr. said Messrs. Zamel and Nader had pitched his client on “a social media platform or marketing strategy” and that “he was not interested and that was the end of it.”

The presentation reviewed by the Journal wasn’t related to the Trump Tower meeting nor was it prepared for Mr. Nader, said Mr. Mukasey, Mr. Zamel’s attorney.

Mr. Mueller has been investigating Mr. Zamel’s work and has interviewed Mr. Zamel about his business relationship with Mr. Nader, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Mukaseyhas said investigators have told him his client isn’t a target of the probe. A subpoena concerning Mr. Zamel’s work, but not issued to Mr. Zamel, was reviewed by the Journal.

Mr. Nader has been cooperating with investigators since January, when investigators stopped him at Dulles Airport and served him with a subpoena.

A lawyer for Mr. Nader said his client has “fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation and will continue to do so.” The lawyer declined to answer further questions.

The Psy-Group was formed by Mr. Zamel, the son of an Australian mining magnate who moved to Israel to study counterterrorism. There, Mr. Zamel founded several companies beginning in 2010 and became increasingly close to the government of the U.A.E., the Journal has previously reported. One of his companies, Wikistrat, did war games and analysis for the U.A.E. in 2014 and say he was close to the national security adviser there, according to people familiar with Mr. Zamel.

People familiar with the Psy-Group’s operations say it provided intelligence services for political and corporate clients.

After the 2016 election, the firm started to pitch for business in the U.S., including for the 2018 midterms. As part of its pitch to potential political clients, the Psy-Group said it had the capability of leveraging fake social-media accounts, which they call avatars, on behalf of political campaigns.

“Psy excels at the use of online avatars that appear natural, unbiased and object. These avatars are highly effective at directing political messaging to target audiences,” marketing materials reviewed by the Journal say. These fake social accounts could be used for “narrative warfare” or to “echo campaign messaging,” the firm said.

No political entity has made any payments to the Psy-Group since 2015, according to Federal Election Commission records. The participation of foreign firms or individuals in U.S. elections is tightly controlled.

"#WhereAreTheChildren

There has never been a more important issue in politics as the fact trump has instructed the ICE to separate young children (babies literally) from their parents and now lost 1450 of them.

Mothers and parents are separated from babies of only a few months old and they will likely never again see their child.

The stories are heartbreaking. A father had his 18 months son ripped from his arms and now that child is missing.

Trump is instructing the ICE to do this.

This isnt nazi Germany 40-45, this is the US 2018.

Parents are forced to wear yellow bracelets (Yellow stars..anyone?) and see their children taken away and the government is not keeping track of where these children are.
trump's government is likely trafficking these children.

Call your representatives in Congress, demonstrate, stand up NOW.

**Roger Stone Sought Information on Clinton From Assange, Emails Show**

*Ex-Trump adviser urged intermediary to ask WikiLeaks for specific dates of rival candidate’s communications*

By Shelby Holliday and  Rob Barry

Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone privately sought information he considered damaging to Hillary Clinton from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The emails could raise new questions about Mr. Stone’s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in September, in which he said he “merely wanted confirmation” from an acquaintance that Mr. Assange had information about Mrs. Clinton, according to a portion of the transcript that was made public.

In a Sept. 18, 2016, message, Mr. Stone urged an acquaintance who knew Mr. Assange to ask the WikiLeaks founder for emails related to Mrs. Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal in 2011 when she was secretary of state, referring to her by her initials.

“Please ask Assange for any State or HRC e-mail from August 10 to August 30--particularly on August 20, 2011,” Mr. Stone wrote to Randy Credico, a New York radio personality who had interviewed Mr. Assange several weeks earlier. Mr. Stone, a longtime confidant of Donald Trump, had no formal role in his campaign at the time.

In another email, Mr. Credico then asked Mr. Stone to give him a “little bit of time,” saying he thought Mr. Assange might appear on his radio show the next day. A few hours later, Mr. Credico wrote: “That batch probably coming out in the next drop...I can’t ask them favors every other day .I asked one of his lawyers...they have major legal headaches riggt now..relax.”

Mr. Credico said in an interview with the Journal that he never passed the message on to Mr. Assange or his lawyers, but “got tired” of Mr. Stone “bothering” him, and so told Mr. Stone he had passed along the message. Mr. Credico said he did so because he owed Mr. Stone a favor for helping him book Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson as a guest on his show.

Mr. Stone, in a text message to the Journal, said that Mr. Credico had “provided nothing” to him and that WikiLeaks never handed anything over. Both men deny ever having special access to WikiLeaks’ material.

“I never had possession or access to any Clinton emails or records,” Mr. Stone said, adding that his testimony before the House committee was “complete and accurate.”

Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the emails hadn’t been provided to congressional investigators. “If there is such a document, then it would mean that his testimony was either deliberately incomplete or deliberately false,” said Mr. Schiff, who has continued to request documents and conduct interviews with witnesses despite the committee’s probe concluding earlier this year said.

A lawyer for Mr. Stone, Grant Smith, said the emails hadn’t been turned over to House investigators because they were “not encompassed within the scope of the committee’s request.” Mr. Stone said the emails were preserved at the request of the Senate, which is also conducting a Russian interference probe. Mr. Smith said they hadn’t yet been given to investigators there.

The newly unearthed emails come amid signs that special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is examining Mr. Stone’s role in Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Among other matters, prosecutors have asked about Mr. Stone’s claim to have met with WikiLeaks during the campaign, according to a witness familiar with the investigation.

U.S. officials have said WikiLeaks received material from operatives working on behalf of Russia’s military intelligence group, which Mr. Assange has denied. The Kremlin has denied it meddled in the election.

Messrs. Stone and Credico said they haven’t been contacted by Mr. Mueller’s office, which declined to comment. WikiLeaks didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In the initial email, which included an attachment with photos of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and other documents, Mr. Stone sought to confirm speculation that Mrs. Clinton had unnecessarily supported the decision to “continue bombing Libya” during the height of the country’s civil war in 2011. The conflict ultimately led to Ghadafi’s killing at the hands of opposition forces. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Several weeks after Mr. Stone’s email request, on Oct. 3, 2016, an article ran on Infowars.com, a conservative news outlet to which he frequently contributed during the campaign. The article included some of the same images as Mr. Stone’s initial email to Mr. Credico, and didn’t include any unreleased Clinton-related emails or WikiLeaks material.

The emails appear to be consistent with Mr. Stone’s description in his sworn testimony of Mr. Credico as a “go-between” and an “intermediary” to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, according to a portion of his interview that was made public.

Mr. Credico, who considers himself a supporter of WikiLeaks, has publicly raised questions about the details of Mr. Stone’s claims and in recent weeks has called some of them false.

Mr. Credico said his relationship with Mr. Assange and his team didn’t begin until late August 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder agreed to do his radio show. By that time, Mr. Stone had already claimed to be in touch with Mr. Assange and appeared to predict the release of information damaging to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Stone now says he assumed Mr. Credico was in touch with Mr. Assange during that time.

After earlier asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the House probe, Mr. Credico now says he is willing to talk with investigators. He said he met on Wednesday with the committee’s Democratic staff members for what he called a limited conversation about WikiLeaks, the 2016 campaign and Mr. Stone.

As Mr. Credico has become more vocal about what he says are discrepancies in Mr. Stone’s account, Mr. Stone has responded with a series of threats, according to emails and text messages reviewed by the Journal.

In early April, in one of those emails, Mr. Stone accused Mr. Credico of serving as an informant.

“Everyone says u are wearing a wire for Mueller,” the April 7 email said. Two days later, Mr. Stone wrote: “Run your mouth = get sued.” Mr. Credico denies being an informant.

Mr. Stone said he was warning Mr. Credico against defaming him and urging him to “simply tell the truth.”",wenchette,dzk5hft,hillaryclinton

"Things Cuomo actually accomplished:

Minimum wage of 15 dollars, free tuition college, same-sex marriage earlier than in other states, no longer being able to treat young offenders as adults, a 10 million defense fund for immigrants, tougher gun control laws, additional taxes on millionaires.

I think it's fair to say he's accomplished more progressive policies than all of his attackers including a certain Senator from VT, combined.

But yeah he's a conservative because the purity far left tells us he is.

Nixon might have stood a chance btw, if she had appealed to all voters, including women, POC and Latinos.
As it is, she's obviosuly not interested in our votes, she decided to go after Hillary and she's sucking up to the tiny Berniebro crowd.

If she's going to get more than 10% of the votes with her current negatieve and divisive campaign (calling Cuomo a Republican, shitting on Hillary and POC), you can come back and tell me how wrong I was.;)

"From Hillary's speech just now in NY, about Cuomo:

“We need leaders who believe in producing results and getting things done – leaders like Andrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul,” she said.

“Since Gov. Cuomo took office, New York has passed marriage equality, implemented common-sense gun safety laws, and adopted the strongest paid-family leave policy in America,” Clinton said, rehashing achievements that previous speakers had praised. “He is not afraid to take on anyone who tries to hurt this state or our country.”

Clinton also mentioned the accomplishments where she had personally supported Cuomo. “After the heartbreak of the 2016 election, I was overjoyed when Gov. Cuomo announced plans to put an affordable college education available for everyone,” said Clinton, referring to the Excelsior Scholarship. “I was proud to stand with him when New York became the first state to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.”

Cuomo won the party's nomination with 95% of the vote.

I for one am happy Hillary emphasized Cuomo's progressive accomplishments, especially since Nixon is trying to make him look like some evil republican.

"No, I got that that's what you're saying. But think about the sorts of things a governor does. They create policy, they lobby legislators for that policy, they run the state government bureaucracy. Things like that. There's a bunch of stuff _that does not actually require government office to have experience in._ Likewise, holding elected office does not automatically grant you that kind of experience. For example, the mayor of New York or a few other cities might have handled running a similar bureaucracy... but legislators would not have that experience. There would be very few non-incumbents with that sort of experience, so it's a little ridiculous to expect it as a prerequisite for the same reason it's silly to expect ten years experience for an entry level job. Nixon has run a multimillion dollar non-profit, though, so she does have executive experience. And her legislative experience is going to be about the same as a typical legislator, except that she doesn't get an actual vote and she doesn't get the paycheck.",Solomaxwell6,dzedo26,hillaryclinton
">I have not written any bill, how many has Nixon written?

She's worked on more than 0. She's been part of a number of education advocacy organizations where--again--she had actual _policy_ roles, not just fundraising. Mostly at the city level, not state, but it's still dealing with appropriations in a multibillion dollar budget. That is comparable to state legislators who run for governor.

>I hope to god you're not daring to compare an actress with no experience whatsoever to Hillary who worked for the children's defence fund, worked to get major legislation passed before she ran for senator...

I am claiming that she has experience. I'm not claiming she has as much experience as Hillary did in 2000. The point is that you're making arbitrary standards. If she had done the same amount of work but received a government paycheck for it, you wouldn't be making ""no experience"" claims.

But that's hardly the same thing as no experience; a governor works in advocacy, policy, and management. She's had decades of experience and is well respected in each of those areas. The most relevant attack you can use against her is lack of _breadth_ of experience, rather than depth, because until her candidacy she's been mostly laser focused on education policy.

Her criticisms of Cuomo are stuffed with triggers like “ultra rich donors,” her platform reads like a Xerox of Sanders’ 2016 positions, and just in case you still were wondering about her revolutionary creds, she has sprinkled the p-word generously throughout her tweets, making sure that despite her earlier support of Hillary and her own wealth and fame, she doesn’t give off the deadly whiff of **“establishment”** BO.

> Amid calls for stronger retaliation against Russia for the Skripal case and its meddling in the 2016 elections, some members of Congress have pushed the Trump administration to consider designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.

"*Lede* is interchangeable with *lead*, according to dictionaries. I checked it out of linguistic curiosity because I'm used to [British English](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/lede), in which the *lead* is used. I'd write [*bury the lead*](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/bury_the_lead), which would probably look strange to an American.

[Wikipedia agrees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_paragraph):

>A lead paragraph (sometimes shortened to lead; also spelled lede) is the opening paragraph of an article, essay, book chapter, or other written work that summarizes its main ideas.

[From Grammarist](http://grammarist.com/usage/lead-lede/):

>Long ago the noun lede was an alternative spelling of lead, but *now lede is mainly journalism jargon* for the introductory portion of a news story—or what might be called the lead portion of the news story. Strictly speaking, the lede is the first sentence or short portion of an article that gives the gist of the story and contains the most important points readers need to know.

It hurts, I swear; on one end, you consistently see decorum, statesmanship, intelligence, and empathy with Hillary Clinton--even to this day! Knowledgeable, aware, still passionate about the United States, And then on the other end, absurd headlines of consistent corruption, ineptitude, at such a constant pace it pains me. The F****king hypocritical GOP gets on my damn nerves. The woefully ignorant and those who didn't vote make me sick every damn day! And these people see nothing wrong in Donald Drumpf.

There have been countless examples of Trump v any other political individual and nobody gives a hoot. Mark my word, I long for the day Trump resigns. So help me GOD because this indivudal should not be at 1600 Penn. Everything he does is out of spite and ego, with ignorance magnified tenfold. He speaks gibbrish, communicates in lies, lies lies and lies. All of these people LIE!  AND the F####king Ryan and McConnel say 'oh well' our voters are too stupid.

Never again, never again shall there be another Trump. The stakes were very clear and present, and throughly explained leading up to the election, and significant parts of Wisconsoin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio (I think) all said Let's try this guy. ""LETS TRY THIS GUY"". A know-nothing, endemic narcissist, corrupt, lying, sexual harasser, self-aggrandizing, pompous, caustic, rude, man! Whose whole character SCREAMED not PRESIDENTIAL.

Yet people have the nerve to complain today ""Oh my God, he tore up the IRAN deal"" This man said during the debates that he had no qualms bombing families and the causalties that came with that! Is America so F****ing Stupid! ( I Know the answer is no.... Just 3 states... I get it) But still, EVERY single DAMN DAY--corruption and ineptitude flows from the head down constantly, consistently--and this party--this dead party of LINCOLN, emulate chagrin and indifference. It's sickening, Absolutely sickening!

I'm 23. I voted in POTUS election--first time because I was finally eligiable, and it goes without saying we know who the competent indivdual would've been. But my GOD--the nerve from some journalists to media outlets that these people had to put TRUMP and Former First Lady, Secretary, Senator, Magna Cum Laude on same playing field! Just a Joke!

And the stain, from History onward will not be kind to America. We need a course correct like yesterday! Vote, encourage others to Vote, Trump and his cohorts cannot continue in this manner of violating norms, and denigrating institutions. It just cannot be. 

Forgive me for the rant, but I just get tired of these nonsense headlines, consistent corruption Pruitt, Conway, Munchin/Manchin, and Trump! He lies, and then acts stupid about it. How can this America tolerate this? It's so unbecoming, and Lord help us if he somehow wins a second term. I don't knkow what I would do.",TinkCzru,dypv0lu,hillaryclinton

I've never understood the Feinstein hate from the left.  Does she advocate 100% of what I want 100% of the time?  Nope.  No one does.  She is a fantastic and effective legislator.  That's all I ask for for a dem in the senate.,Scoops1,dygm60e,hillaryclinton
"Ugh. I am strongly pro-Hillary and anti-Bernie (as you can see from my history here) but I am not pro-Feinstein. I don't hate her, I just don't think she's the best choice and I think we can easily get someone more progressive to win both the primaries and the general election. If we're not willing to let primarying be a credible threat, we'll end up with a bunch of Democrats in office who only pass compromise policies.

(People on this thread talking about Obamacare: remember that Obamacare _is_ a compromise policy. It's simply Romneycare at a national level. It's mandatory participation in capitalism. The progressive option is single-payer. The individual mandate was originally proposed by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation in 1989. It first got to Congress as a bill sponsored by 19 Republican senators in 1993, aimed at preventing Hillary Clinton's _employer_ mandate from passing. Obama proposed PPACA after getting a bipartisan group of senators together to figure out something with a chance of bipartisan support, and they suggested the individual mandate. The idea that Obamacare is a left-wing proposal has its roots in right-wing obstructionism instead of facts, because the Republicans don't want health care at all. Us going ""but she supports Obamacare!"" as evidence of someone's left-wing _bona fides_ is just buying into right-wing alternative facts.)",ldpreload,dyi5jg3,hillaryclinton

1. She’s old and out of touch. So are most Senators and many House Member. She’s been in her position for a long long long time sense 1992 that’s before I was even alive! And I’m 22 what could she possibly understand about me or any of the issues I’m facing or voters 4 years younger then me who are 18? People tried to make a thing about Hillary and Bernie’s age who are 70 and 74! Feinstein is 84 years old.  2. Because of this she’s resistant to new ideas like legal weed and health care of all and not taking corporate money. Her policies for being California representative are not as liberal as they should be. Her positions are what I’d expect of a Wisconsins Senators Democrat not California’s!. And she’s only recently updated her opinions during primary season. That bugs me even more because it shows she a fake.

He’s showing his age has not gotten to his head and let it stop him from opening to new ideas! Feinstein and Pelosi barely just got on board for legal Weed recently when the state they represented supported it by 60% are you kidding me? That’s my issue with age! Get old man and old women who won’t evolve with the issue out of the federal government! ,bleach143,dyii777,hillaryclinton
"Excuse me?
Thanks to Pelosi we got Obamacare which was one of the greatest steps forward in getting to universal healthcare.

It was an incredible accomplishment and just one of the examples how she's managed to make sure the Dems voted as one bloc.
She's been extremely effective.
Let me add this: she's recognized by most as one of the best/ most effective leaders in Congress Dems ever had, that you dont know or acknowledge that, kinda undermines your 'Im not a misogynist' story.

And also: what does money or being rich have to do with it?
Find me some poor Senators🙄
Seems youre holding women to double standards no man in Congress can live up to.",Danie2009,dygto65,hillaryclinton
"failed? Obama can thank Pelosi for many of his ""accomplishments"". Without her he would have been largely stymied. ",patcakes,dyjz71h,hillaryclinton
"Then your issue is with political stance, not age.  ",sweatybronson,dyii9tz,hillaryclinton
"You keep trying to paint me as some sort of woman-hater. I'm a hardcore feminist and a woman (and a lesbian). Like, I just don't get it. I'm talking about two female Congresswomen *only* because they represent my city and state. 

Yes, I knew you were going to bring up Obamacare. But I'm talking about the lack of courage the Dems had after POTUS pushed that through. They had more than a year to do a lot of things and they lacked the moral courage to do them. 

You know what?

Forget it. I don't want Pelosi representing me anymore, and I'm entitled to that opinion. Have a nice day. ",,dygvpn1,hillaryclinton
Ago often plays into political stance. After being in power so long and then getting older you get more and more stuck in your ways of thinking.  ,bleach143,dyiicba,hillaryclinton
"Whatever you have against Feinstein or Pelosi: its absolute bs to suggest Pelosi hasnt been an extremely effective and strong leader or to bring up their wealth/ income.

I could at least understand it if you could name points you disagree with either of them...
",Danie2009,dyh3hwz,hillaryclinton
""" a year to do a lot of things ...?"" Were you alive the first two years? The stimulus? By summer, the Republicans had made healthcare the central issue and it consumed Obama's agenda. I wish Obama had dealt with immigration first, but he set the sights on health care. After the first two years, they did't have the votes.",patcakes,dyjzexh,hillaryclinton
"Again, you don't like old folks with one political stance, but do like old folks with another.  

Whatever correlation or causation there may be, your issue is with political stance, not age.  

There are plenty of senators in their 40s-60s who are more conservative than Feinstein or Pelosi, and just as if not more stuck in their ways.

Can you stop accusing fellow Democrats of misogyny if they criticise a female politician ? ,mrs_bungle,dyhdqet,hillaryclinton
Not Democrats! There are few Democrats in there 40s or 50s who represents California who didn’t support something as simple as legal weed in 2017-2018 it’s the most liberal state in the nation it’s not controversy to support that in California long long before 2018 ,bleach143,dyij03e,hillaryclinton
"Nope, not as long as they apply criticism and double standards to women.

Fyi: it is entirely possible to criticize female politicians on the issues without singling them out as women.",Danie2009,dyhusm8,hillaryclinton
"As of September 29, 2016, this is a list of California reps who supported legalization of weed:  

Mike Honda (D.-Calif.)
Jared Huffman (D.-Calif.)
Barbara Lee (D.-Calif.)
Ted Lieu (D.-Calif.)
Zoe Lofgren (D.-Calif.)
Alan Lowenthal (D.-Calif.)
Dana Rohrabacher (R.-Calif.)

Except they weren’t applying double standards were they? And you were overly eager to assume they had something against woman.,mrs_bungle,dyiyahe,hillaryclinton
Yes each from their own district! California as a whole is super Liberal! And super far left! The amount of excuses you keep making for her is astounding! Senators Represent states and CA is the most Liberal of all. Coming out for weed and being in favor of Weed is easy and yet she didn’t do it till she was pressured to till 2018.  16 Democratic Senators are in favor of single payer and she’s not one of them! Some from states like New Mexico and Wisconsin states far less progressive! And guess what? All much younger Senators! Older Senators should be leading the party in the new direction not holding the party back in time to the early 2000s,bleach143,dyil45y,hillaryclinton
"The amount of exclamation points you use is astounding:-).  

I literally just contradicted your claim, and then you handwaved it away...  Like, it's okay to be wrong.  Just admit it.  

She came out in support of weed like 1 or 2 years later than Kamala did.  

And again, your argument needs to be with policy, not age.  

There are plenty of younger DEM politicians to her right.  In CA, not in CA, etc.  
She supports a medicare-for-all buy-in program.  It's smarter and a better transition than single payer.  

I still don't get how 'be like Canada' is so much more progressive than 'be like France, Germany, Japan, etc.'

Tough call for me.

Eoin Higgins is one of the worst Berniebros on Twitter, constantly attacking women, retweeting Greenwald and so on.
The guy is a sick pos.

I tend not to believe a word that pos writes.

Why does it take Giuliani being a braindead moron to ""catch"" them in this lie?

If this was a drug deal and it was in a court of law, and someone's lawyer was like, ""I gave this person that amount of money but my client didn't know"" under what circumstances would that be taken seriously? The lawyers for their side shouldn't need be also make ridiculous admissions. It was absurd from the start.

"I miss Comey showing some regret for his harsh comments on Hillary when he announced the FBI closed the investigation. He clearly broke the protocol and I believe it was his ego doing it. However, Loretta Lynch should've recused herself and hand the case down to Sally Yates. But that doesn't excuse Comey.

He explained his decision to reveal the reopening of Clinton investigation but to keep quiet about the investigation into the Russia's meddling with the elections and possible links to the Trump campaign. I still believe that he should've included a warning about the foreign adversary's attempts to disrupt the election and possibly swing it to Trump, thus making his letter about the current state of the play. Chaffetz would've though twice whether to leak it or not. Maybe that would've started a much needed conversation about the meddling, fake stories, Russian trolls and cyberwar. Hillary's emails wouldn't be the one and only issue to nibble on.",Outwit_All_Liars,dy5vp86,hillaryclinton
"Bs.
He sat on the fact trump was under FBI investigation in 2016, but somehow he had to send a letter to the biggest leaker in Congress?

Edit: if the simple fact that the FBI had to reopen the investigation was justification for Comey to leak if, why werent we told that the FBI and the Justice Department opened an investigation of Jane Sanders for bankfraud in March 2016?",Danie2009,dy6dtr7,hillaryclinton
"With the position that he has, he was wrong to assume what he did wouldn't have any impact 11 days out from election day whether it's his job or not. He's a fool.",,dy6o32b,hillaryclinton
"We all had this discussion every day for months before and after the election. Comey isn't really providing much new information so there's no much new to discuss. Not that another discussion isn't welcome but many of us just have nothing else to say.

Personally, I don't hate Comey but I hold him responsible for his mistakes. I don't think he is holding himself responsible. I give him a little credit for grappling with this all in public because that must be difficult. But as far as I know he has yet to really take responsibility.

For all the crowing he does about the public's perception of integrity at the FBI he sure seems okay with the idea that the FBI director became a household name by determining the outcome of the presidential election. The idea that the public has a better perception of the FBI because of the way he acted is silly.

Because of his actions this country got Trump and the FBI is no better off. He stepped out of protocol for this?",smocca,dy6gkcp,hillaryclinton

"The protocol told him to shut up. That was his third door he couldn't see. He broke the protocol twice with Clinton and observed it with Trump. He chose his role to be overseeing the process and defending the FBI, on the top of just investigating... I understand his frustrations, but he made some very consequential political mistakes.",Outwit_All_Liars,dy7fsii,hillaryclinton
"Wut?

The FBI opened its investigation into the Russia involvement AND trump's involvement in July 2016:

""James Comey, the FBI director at the time, would later testify that the FBI in late July 2016 began investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump campaign associates were involved in those efforts. The New York Times would later report that Page’s speech in Moscow “was a catalyst for the F.B.I. investigation into connections between Russia and President Trump’s campaign.""

https://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/timeline-russia-investigation/

Comey has made it absolutely clear that from the very beginning the trump campaign was also under investigation. the date the investigation by the FBI started was July 2016.

Fact is that that knowledge was withheld from the voters/ public.
Another fact was that there was NO reason to tell the public about the Weiner emails and that the Justice department was against going public about this.

Comey fucked up badly and you should stick to the facts if you feel some strange need to defend him.
",Danie2009,dy6mbdw,hillaryclinton
"Comey took three extremely public actions, against the advice of his superiors at the DOJ, that were unprecedented. It was foreseeable before he took those actions that they would affect the outcome of the election. It is undeniable in hindsight that they did in fact have a decisive impact.

It seems that he took a risk. He figured that Hillary Clinton was a lock to win, so he could do what he did without real consequences. In the end, he thought that would make the FBI look independent and the election would be unaffected. Things only seemed this way because she had such a seemingly insurmountable lead. It turned out it wasn't insurmountable, so his estimation that his actions would not impact the election was wrong. The risk he took didn't pay off and rather than having his cake and eating it too, we got Trump and the FBI is under more scrutiny now than they ever would have been had he quietly handled the case the same way the FBI handles every other case: Quietly and professionally.",smocca,dy7dfp0,hillaryclinton
[removed],,dy6vzdd,hillaryclinton
[removed],,dy7fzea,hillaryclinton
"You haven't made any argument for why this case was so different that it necessitated setting aside decades of precedent. After Hoover, the FBI consciously made efforts to avoid even the appearance of impacting upon politics. Even Comey has talked about this. Comey set that aside because he was worried about the public perception of Loretta Lynch announcing that there would be no prosecution.

But he went further when he decided to announce it himself. He editorialized about her behavior in a way that the FBI never has before in regard to a case. Why? Please say something other than this case was different. Please offer some reasons why the FBI should behave so drastically different. If its not about affecting politics, why not just handle the case like every other?

Because it WAS about politics. Just not Democrat vs Republican politics. Comey was trying to maximize the perception of impartiality of the FBI. He was worried about public blowback at the decision and so he tried to walk this fine line.

If it was only about doing what was right he wouldn't have editorialized nor even given such a public press conference in July. If it wasn't about trying to placate Republicans he wouldn't have written those letters in October and November. Those actions are not standard and do not make any sense if the only goal is to handle the case fairly. His actions are all about playing politics just from the perspective of an advocate of the FBI.",smocca,dy7gdjc,hillaryclinton

If you can interpret my initial comment as a legitimate critique of the pervasive attitude in this subreddit, and that user's responses as a hostile validation of that critique, I think you might see where I'm coming from. 


Edit: Also, I was saying that user was projecting. It's not really possible for that person to attack me personally in any way that would actually be hurtful, though they are definitely trying, especially in those PM's. I haven't felt remotely upset or threatened throughout the entire exchange. ",scrumtrellescent,dy4tu27,hillaryclinton

"PMs included it's a wash now, sorry if you're dealing with that. But I think I understand their original point. They were calling out someone for trolling and more power to them. I don't think you were trolling however.

One thing I see on Reddit comments a lot is a second person coming into a thread with their own thoughts, and the first viewing it as an attack rather than an additional thought in a conversation. I viewed that as happening both directions with you two.

Don't want to jump into this too much though, I just felt like sharing my thoughts because it's clear you both were passionate in your responses and it was upsetting to see them interpreted as attacks both ways.",fsm_the_alfredo,dy4u41t,hillaryclinton
"My main issue is there doesn't seem to be respect for other opinions or an understanding of where they come from, and I mean that in a very broad sense. I randomly checked in here, don't think I've been here since 2016, and I was surprised by the tweet. I didn't think Hillary was still active politically and I didn't know this sub was active either. 



This post reached r/all, and I saw a comment that was basically the same reaction I had to seeing it. Then I saw it was getting downvoted, and the user I've been going back and forth with was being very personal and hostile toward that person. It reminded me of the general feeling I've always had when I come here. I unsubbed a long time ago because the culture here is actually kind of toxic. So I said something along those lines. 


I notice the same things in r/politics. So many conservatives have liberal stances when you question them in a way that doesn't trigger them. So many of them are looking for the door. But they feel unwelcome by liberals, because there is an endless stream of shaming and ridicule toward them. This approach will never persuade anyone. It drives people to entrench themselves. If you want people to join you, you have to respect where they currently are and seek common ground and common goals, then maybe if you're lucky the differences will become common ground too. For such a prominent political figure it's always struck me as bizarre how exclusive and hostile her subreddit is. 


Liberals seem so convinced that they have the moral and intellectual high ground that they're oblivious to how they are perceived and how much they alienate potential allies. I don't care about mean comments from internet strangers. It was annoying for maybe a few minutes. I care about unifying the lower and middle classes. Projection and lack of mutual respect is a pervasive issue and a major obstacle to that. I commented because of the condescending hostility I saw toward another user for having the wrong reaction to the post. This sub and this public figure got some rare visibility on this site and screwed it up. It makes Hillary and liberals look bad. I think a lot of people have checked in here and decided not to stick around. There's no reason why Hillary couldn't have a  comparable presence to Bernie on this site. I think this sub, and liberals in general, shoot themselves in the foot. ",scrumtrellescent,dy4w2lo,hillaryclinton

I wanted to see her speak her in person, but I didn’t belong to the right circles, so I never got a chance.  That’s not good.

">And as I've argued before, when you have reporters on Twitter essentially filling in as the voices of the institution? That's a recipe for pure disaster. First off, they're Godawful at it. Just terrible. Secondly, it's unfair. Why don't the publishers stand up and defend the NYT?


>Today, you have the opinion page editors trying to ""steer"" the direction of the Chozick fallout with three anti-Clinton letters. So clumsy and obvious! When the defense of a *damned newspaper* is ""the candidate was really to blame"" then journalism has failed completely. #NYT


>And when that newspaper is the New York Times, well...you can see how the threat to democracy developed in this country. Think about it, folks. That's Eighth Avenue cherrypicking three letters to basically prove the argument Trump makes daily: ""Hillary to blame.""

">Following Clinton’s impassioned speech, Adichie (clad in hot pink for the occasion) joined her on stage. Together, they covered topics from Clinton’s hesitation to display emotion publicly—growing up in the 1950s, she said, was a time in which exhibiting any kind of emotion was “the worst thing you could do”—to the problem of Clinton’s likability (Adichie: “I kept thinking, Who the hell cares? She’s qualified!”). The two discussed the last few years of Clinton’s life, in and out of politics. Clinton, in turn, gave her answers with more candor than we’re generally privy to; when asked, for example, about the untruths that the public has believed about her, she cited an Ohio State study that detailed the significant influence of three stories on Obama voters who either didn’t vote in 2016 or voted for Trump or a third party. “The three were: that I was dying,” she said, incredulously. “The second was that the Pope had endorsed Trump. And the third was that I was supplying weapons to ISIS. Now, why do people believe that? Well, partly because those stories are delivered in a way that looks like news.” ",,dxzc83c,hillaryclinton

Hillary Clinton

I found this also very curious. Because to the best of my memory, no man who ever lost a presidential election was ever told to shut up and go away. And I’m glad they weren’t, because each had points of view and experiences that were worth hearing about.

I’ve given a lot of thought to this, and I do conclude — and I write about it in my book — that there is this long, long history of trying to silence women. Literally in literature, in the western canon, it goes back to The Odyssey.

Penelope is holding the whole country together while Odysseus is taking his time getting back. She’s raising their son, Telemachus.

There’s a very telling scene where all the usual partiers and others are hanging around, hoping that she’ll finally decide that her husband’s dead and marry one of them so that they can take over. Telemachus is now about 17, so he’s a young man.

His mother comes down, as she always did, to greet people and listen to their complaints and to continue being the glue that held the country together. And her son greets her by saying, “Mother, go back upstairs. Speech is not for women.”

The really terrific classics professor Mary Beard — who some of you know, and if you don’t, look her up — has just written a book about women and power, in which she traces this whole line of being quiet: “Don’t speak. Don’t speak up.”

Now, for everyone saying, “Well, that’s a Hillary Clinton problem.” The people who they’d interview, saying, “Well, of course I would vote for a woman! Just not that woman.” In the last year and a half, what have we seen?""",Danie2009,dy04ex2,hillaryclinton

Maybe people of the past were more gracious (I honestly don't know). Maybe we are less gracious. Is that wrong? What does one even have to do with the other? People say the same thing about fearfulness. Like, we are more fearful nowadays of a lot of things and that supposedly doesn't make sense because everything has improved.

>**Here are the key things people should know about Donald Trump. He comes from a family of criminals**: His grandfather made his fortune running whorehouses in Seattle and in the Yukon Territory. His father, Fred, had a business partner named Willie Tomasello, who was an associate of the Gambino crime family. Trump's father was also investigated by the U.S. Senate for ripping off the government for what would be the equivalent of $36 million in today's money. Donald got his showmanship from his dad, as well as his comfort with organized criminals.

>I think it is very important for religious Americans to know that Donald Trump says that his personal philosophy of life is revenge. He has called anyone who turns the other cheek -- which is a fundamental teaching of Christ in the Sermon on the Mount -- a fool, an idiot or a schmuck. Trump is a man who says things that are absolutely contrary to the teachings of the New Testament. He also denigrates Christians. Yet you see all of these ministers endorsing him.

>I've followed Donald for 30 years. I don't see any evidence that he has changed, and he certainly hasn't repented, which is a fundamental Christian obligation.

>He is a racist through and through. He has been found in formal judicial proceedings to discriminate against nonwhites in rentals and employment.

> Disturbed white shooter opens fire on victims with AR-15 and would’ve killed more if he wasn’t disarmed by an unarmed black hero. The Waffle House/James Shaw Jr story totally dismantles the right-wing fantasy that white good guys with guns are saving us from a minority hellscape.

"So watching Comey's appearance on the View - I'm glad someone brought up his hypocrisy of bringing up her emails vs not bringing up the ongoing Russian investigation - listening to Comey trying to justify not revealing the Russian investigation, I just heard him throwing Lynch and Obama under the bus in his justification.  He specifically said about Russia that they didn't ""know they had anything"" at that point but at the same time he didn't know he ""had anything"" with the emails they found on Weiner's laptop (and eventually there was nothing) yet he felt the need to disclose THAT investigation and not the other.  His logic doesn't make sense and he seems to bring in Obama as a scapegoat in this matter when he himself didn't apply the same standards to the HRC emails.  

Here's his interview on The View about the emails and the Russian Investigation:

He knew Hillary's investigation was going nowhere, but if he didn't say anything, he risked leaks, Hillary being called an illegitimate president, and the FBI being called partisan.

He was essentially concerned about what Fox News would convince the American people of...

Comey is so weird for me. I'm not happy with him. And I totally see that ""I alone can fix this"" mentality that Trump and Sanders have. But at the same time, I can sympathize. The last few years have taught me more than I could have imagined about myself politically. And one of the things that I've learned, is that I actually very much do believe in our governmental system and structure...As, anyone who chooses to get a legal education tends to, but I just hadn't examined that deeply held belief until this administration \(although it really started with Mitch during the Obama administration\) started tearing it down. I find myself going ""He can't legally do that...guys..guys..why is he being allowed to do that.."" And that's Comey. 

To me, Comey tried to protect our system from a major political sub\-culture. He through out a few pages to protect the book \- but ended up burning down the whole library. His sin, IMO, is he fails to see how he contributed to the problem of illegitimacy..that every move he made to counteract the fox news narrative, legitimized what that narrative was saying. I think a lot of this book is him trying to convince us, and himself, that he did the right thing.

I am so disheartened to hear (again) that the Great Barrier Reef is dying. (Specifically that half the reef died in the last year.) 

We’ve reached a point of no return. In the late 1800’s oil execs predicted that our carbon emissions would affect the atmosphere.

In the 1970s Scientific consensus was that global warming was happening and was caused by human activity.

In the 2000’s republicans claimed that human activity is not causing climate change and branded the truth, science, and factual information as a political issue.

I have always considered myself a conservative Democrat, a moderate, but lately I’m told that I’m a big state leftist.... and perhaps that is coming true.

In a classically liberal sense, the free market should solve our climate and environmental problems, but the market failed. The market failed when patents for electric cars were bought by fossil fuel interests. The market failed when propaganda convinced half of American voters that climate change is a myth. 

We have reached a point of no return.

The best we can hope for is an acclamation to our changing planet. Similarly to every conversation Americans (especially our representatives) should be having, regarding factual evidence based policy, one side just claims that there is no problem, and thus forcing anyone who is educated to take an extreme stance.  This applies to gun legislation, environment, immigration, automation, healthcare and so much more.

The careless destruction of the environment is also my biggest concern about the unchecked GOP hold on Wisconsin. People know Walker for act 10 but forget that Act 1 was his mining legislation. That was his #1 priority. The only thing that kept the Penokee Hills from being utterly devastated was the hold up from the federal government and somehow I don't think the current administration would stand in their way.  When I first came to WI for college I was so impressed by the environmental attitude of this state. The state of Aldo Leopoldo and Gaylord Nelson.  ,wi_voter,dxodde1,hillaryclinton

"The good news is that his support seems to be dwindling (yes, yes, yes...I know all about that stupid poll that you guys clutch to like Trump does to the electoral map), and Our Rev endorsed candidates are getting beat in every important election, but if you want an honest answer, yes we need to take him/them seriously because they're still buying into his nonsense. 

You're proof of that.

Bernie will run in 2020 because of his massive ego, and it's an easy way to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars from poor people to him and his cronies. I mean, Hillary broke her arm several weeks ago when she accidentally stepped between Bernie and a microphone. 

So, let's assume he is. He will probably win Iowa because white people and caucuses. He will win NH because he's from a neighboring state. Then what happens in Nevada? That will be interesting, and where Bernie supporters lost their minds in 2016. Who comes out of the first 3 to challenge Bernie? 

Then SuperTuesday and the Southern primaries. This is when Bernie got crushed, and was basically mathematically eliminated. Of course, he didn't want to do the honorable thing, and concede. No, he wanted to stay in, so he could milk as much money out of you suckers for as long as possible. It worked! Bernie won 4 out of 13 states, with 2 being caucuses (of course) and 1 his home state. But now we have included California! 

So, does Harris run, and win California and most of the Southern states? That could be a big blow to Saint Bernard. Once again, getting crushed by Dems most reliable voting block - black women. If she doesn't run, does Cali give Bernie a huge boost? Could happen.

Does Bernie win enough delegates early because of the other Dems splitting the votes, so he can win - just like Trump? 

Does the Dems concede early, so that doesn't happen? 

Does someone come out of nowhere to take it like often happens?

Do Dems challenge Bernie, and does he actually get vetted by the media and his opponents? 

Does Biden run to save the Dems from Bernie and Trump? 

Who knows, but yes I think it would be a mistake to ignore Bernie, and treat him with kid gloves like last time.... ",king-schultz,dxlbm5r,hillaryclinton

"Great read. Especially in context of Hillary supporters and the validation of what we've been talking about since Nov 2016. Comey's book and his shameless promotion seem to have finally woken some members of the MSM about the impact of his announcement and the hypocrisy of his justifications. A little too late but at least there is acknowledgement in terms of slow realization. That gives me hope. 

>As Jonathan Chait explains, Comey’s willingness to let such concerns influence these episodes reflects the success of a decades-long campaign by Republicans and GOP-aligned media to skew the political dialog by hyping fake scandals, which in this case led Comey to act to “avoid charges of favoritism,” thus willingly handing bad-faith actors leverage over law enforcement. It’s hard to read Comey’s NPR interview as anything other than confirmation of this. Worse, Comey also revealed that not allowing this to happen would have been a perfectly appropriate outcome.


>All of this implicates the media’s conduct as well — both before and after the fact. Though Comey’s last-minute email revelation admittedly created a complicated editorial conundrum, it was widely hyped by the media in a manner that was surely disproportionate, given that at the time, no one knew whether the emails amounted to anything at all (which, it turned out, they didn’t). As Nate Silver has shown, the episode may have helped tip the election to Trump.


>**When supporters of Clinton made these points after the election, they were widely derided for being in denial about the real reasons Clinton lost.** The notion that Comey and related over-the-top press coverage might have played an important role was greeted — including by some neutral reporters — as self-evidently, uproariously, knee-slappingly absurd, as if it constituted nothing more than hopeless partisan brainwashing.

",,dxjbcvm,hillaryclinton
"Comey seems to think that mindlessly following rules, traditions, and norms is necessarily ""non-partisan"" and absolves him of any blame, never stopping to think that many of those same rules, traditions, and norms are *themselves* partisan, and aren't just simply because they're principles. 

For a guy who calls himself the paragon of impartiality and fairness, he seems very interested in ""perception"" and image and the press reaction and hype and optics--to a fault. I believe he is honest, and that he's telling the truth, but he also comes across as vain and sanctimonious as, say, Kanye West.

His opting for appeals to ideals rather than the predictable consequences of his actions is pretty damning.

Absolutely! And I think we should counter with this every time a faux-progressive brings up ""identity politics"" as a negative. It's irksome that they've managed to twist it and reduce it to this label. 

And yeah, we need a debate. We need engagement. Hillary was the only one who engaged. Thank god she still is. And I have noticed a backlash to the anti-identity politics push from the Bernie left. I just hope the Democratic party hasn't gone too far down the rabbit hole.

",,dxjp9yd,hillaryclinton
"Yup.
I really dont understand these pseudo progressives.

I mean I totally understand it when people are against American involvement let alone another Iraq war, but the blatant whitewashing of one of the worst dictators ever alive is stunning.

I know someone who fled from Syria in the 90s, he described the Assad sr regime: from the Hama massacre on, this regime has murdered everyone it could.

Since when is it left or progressive to support one of the worst regimes ever?

And Gabbard is an Islamophobe creep who likes Assad because he will oppose Islam🙄",Danie2009,dxjgws8,hillaryclinton

"> but the blatant whitewashing of one of the worst dictators ever alive is stunning.

Totally. This is one of the most worrying things about how the general public is viewing Syria - a complete disregard for the genocide that has been ongoing for the last 5 years.  People are acting as if the air strikes last week was the beginning of a war... except the war there has been ongoing for 5 years.

You can't be ""progressive"" and condone what Assad has been doing. Supporting ""non-intervention"" is not a good enough excuse to support politicians who are being paid by Putin and Assad.

Gabbard is one of the worst.  She is proof of the horseshoe theory.  Her entire persona is built around being anti-Obama and pro-Assad. But isn't it funny how she hasn't said about Trump.

>I know someone who fled from Syria in the 90s, he described the Assad sr regime: from the Hama massacre on, this regime has murdered everyone it could.

Assad is vicious. Like you I know people from there and people who have lived there - it's devastating to hear them talk about how a civilized country has been destroyed by one man and his regime.",,dxji87u,hillaryclinton
"> Nah, there are some really strong Dem voices who will make sure the Dem party will continue to be committed to civil rights.

Yeah you're right. It's difficult not to get jaded with the Bro influx but there is a good group of Defenders in the Dem party.  They just need to keep Bernie in check and realize that he's independent... which I think is happening but it needs to happen faster.

I read that Hillary is going to headline DNC fundraiser with Harris, Gillebrand etc so at least that shows that they know that her voters still matter.

>Btw: I read tonight Holder might run for the nomination in 2020!

I love him... but I dunno about him running just because I think what he's doing right now is the most important thing he could be doing instead of campaigning. But still, he would be a great candidate. 

Ideally, I would like to see a Harris/Booker ticket (either combo) especially because they're east coast and west coast dems united.

"I am becoming a bit concerned with the Democratic Congressional Camapagin Committee and it's consistent mistakes. The same time we know this election is a fundamental matter of life and death.

 We are facing the crisis that we do because Republicans  have been highly disciplined and organized. The Democratic cause in this moment requires us to do the same. We need to be long-term, strategic, well-financed and well-aligned. We also must act at the local, state and national levels simultaneously and in sync, resolute in each forum in which power is contested: redistricting, legislative action, electoral work, leadership development. We have finally seen that for too long up close what happens when that power is uncontested. Most especially here in Texas where it’s considerable damage to our State has lay bear. 

Right-wing control in a majority of states most especially Texas has been exploited to draw congressional and state legislative district lines that perpetuate minority voting power to lock in a distorted majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and shut democrats out of meaningful presence in state houses. Yet at this pivotal moment in time the Democratic Party seems to have a awkward and disjointed game plan on recruited candidates and Electoral strategy. With the myriad of polling recently showing the liar and chief strengthening and democratic candidates generic ballot shrinking something is not aligned correctly.

The Democrats cannot reclaim power or leadership until we can give voice to the widespread economic insecurities felt throughout America and deliver!! Lies  drew some voters, to a con artist lying bastard like Trump. HOWEVER they were effective in the first place because democrats failed to connect, but when the lies and bs implode like we have seen voters will not just vote for dems,  (again recent polling) unless they believe we can deliver and I'm afraid we are potentially screwing ourselves out of yet another election that is ours to win. This is just frustrating sorry for the rant.

"I just looked up the the channel and time of the interview ABC and it conflicts with the one show my History Nerd son and I watch together on NBC: **Timeless**.   So, it's a no-brainer, I'm watching Timeless.",NaturesGirl,dxfheeb,hillaryclinton
"> "" the Trump-Russia investigation needed to be kept secret because the people under investigation didn’t know that the F.B.I. was on to them. To reveal it would have imperiled the investigation. "" 

Which is why the correct thing to do would've been to say absolutely nothing about the new lead unless it actually turned up something (which it didn't). By attempting to keep the FBI nonpartisan *he made it partisan*. And if the NY FBI would've leaked it? That's his fault too. He ran the organization. He couldn't get his house in order and it led him to make a distinctly Hooverian decision. 

The *only* argument I'm even somewhat sympathetic to is that Lynch shouldn't have met Bill on the tarmac and put him in the position where the FBI had to take the lead on the case. But even in that instance, he didn't have to campaign against Clinton. 

What really pissed me off about that interview tonight was his line about the public needing to be accountable for for electing Trump. Motherfucker played a *bigger role than goddamn anyone* in making that happen, and all he does is make excuses for it.

"Bernie refused to endorse her until mid-July, months after he was mathematically eliminated. He called Hillary Clinton unqualified to be president, and lied that she had made the same comment about him, after he suffered a bad loss in early April. The primary was -over- in April, but Bernie still tried to attack Clinton. Then in JUNE, he offered to debate Donald Trump on live television (again, after Hillary was the presumptive nominee... all Bernie wanted to do was give himself, and Donald Trump, some more of the spotlight).

His supporters then protested the convention, booed over Elizabeth Warren, chanted ""NO TPP"" over Barack Obama, booed Marcia Fudge, booed civil rights leaders, booed Sarah Silverman when she said ""Bernie or Bust"" is ridiculous. They literally attempted to eat beans and simultaneously fart to clear the building (yes, this actually happened https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/sanders-fans-plan-dnc-fart-protest-clinton-nomination-n611596)

Sanders enabled that behavior by making his most volatile supporters his delegates. They even booed *HIM* when he said to elect Clinton (https://youtu.be/rTH6YdbM-WA). He created this monster and never tamed it or took responsibility. He never condemned their actions toward Roberta Lange, he never condemned them throwing dollar bills at Hillary's motorcade as if she was a stripper, he thanked a man for introducing him at a rally after that same mad had just called Hillary Clinton a ""whore"" in his introduction.

Even in Bernie's own speech, he doesn't mention Hillary Clinton until ~12 minutes into the speech (aside from one throwaway line 'This election is not about Hillary Clinton'). Compare that to Hillary's 2008 convention speech when the first thing she does is giving a ringing endorsement of Barack Obama and helps redirect her supporters' passion and enthusiasm to him.",JodySalerno,dxeaaot,hillaryclinton

">Why did Comey make that decision? His book, A Higher Loyalty, will be released on Tuesday. But accounts of its contents and excerpts published by outlets that have obtained copies of the book make clear that he concedes that he believed Clinton was going to win. “It is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president,” Comey wrote, “my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls. But I don’t know.”

>This is an astonishing admission. Justice Department guidelines bar officials from making important disclosures related to investigations close to elections to avoid influencing them. Comey took it upon himself to decide that, based on his concern that keeping the news confidential could call the legitimacy of a Clinton presidency into question, he had to announce that the investigation was being restarted. But that was not his decision to make; the role of the FBI is to investigate crimes, it is not to use its authority to protect or harm the legitimacy of a given politician. A hypothetical Clinton administration’s legitimacy should not have been a factor in Comey’s decision whatsoever; Comey should only have been concerned with following the Justice Department’s guidelines, which exist to protect the integrity of the democratic process, and which Comey followed in the case of the Republican candidate.

>The fact that the Trump inquiry was kept under wraps while the Clinton inquiry was not simply accentuates the importance of the Justice Department rules against making such announcements close to an election—rules that Comey broke for one candidate but not for the other.",,dxc73xp,hillaryclinton

"Another complication of this situation is the way he was fired. I wanted Comey fired in July 2016. That ridiculous press conference should have been the end, but I get why perceptions and practicalities made that difficult/impossible.

But at the same time, Trump's firing of Comey was the act of a wanna be dictator. The Rosenstein memo that tried to dress it up like it was making right on his pre-election actions was an insult to this country.

These issues need to be dealt with. I want to see all of this catch up to all of them. I think, to me, that's why this is so pleasing to see.",smocca,dxavits,hillaryclinton

"The anti-abortion crowd really bothers me, especially since I've had abortions.  They talk about being pro-life, but they completely disregard existing life.  If a woman doesn't want to go through a pregnancy and have something in her body that she doesn't want there, she shouldn't have to.  And if a woman doesn't want to parent, then that would be unfair to everyone involved.  If I got pregnant again, an abortion would be the only option. I'm in my 20s, in school full time, working 30 hours a week, making less than 20K a year and unmarried. Additionally, I know that I'm not prepared emotionally to raise a child. I know some people talk about adoption, but it would absolutely kill me for the baby that I carried to be considering another woman his or her mother. Some young women talk about how they keep their babies because they love them too much to give them up, but the fact is, loving the baby isn't enough. Love isn't going to provide food or shelter or insurance, money will do that, and I barely have enough to support myself, let alone a child. Even birth control isn't 100% effective.
And lastly - I can't help but notice that so many of these anti-abortion people are men. Men who have no chance of EVER getting pregnant and don't have a bunch of old guys telling them what to do with their bodies.",kerryfinchelhillary,dx9qk1w,hillaryclinton
"You're totally right, about everything. This is why I wish more women who have had to make the decision to get a abortion are afforded a louder voice. We are leaving it to conservatives and men who are framing the issue as pro-life vs pro-abortion which is not the case. There's the issue of our choice and autonomy but also the financial considerations you've spelled out. This is not discussed enough.

Also, how can ""pro-life"" people be against abortion and then also be against maternal and child health care?

"I agree with everything you said.  With my situation that I mentioned in the first post, having a baby would probably be the single worst thing that could happen to me.  I want children one day when I'm married and have a decent income.  But I think a woman should be able to get an abortion even if she just doesn't want kids or to go through a pregnancy.  A baby is a lifelong commitment, and a pregnancy drastically alters your life for nine months.  For a while, I was afraid to speak publicly about mine because I knew there would be SOME people who would completely disregard my needs, because to the religious right, a fetus is the most sacred thing in the world.",kerryfinchelhillary,dxcqjc5,hillaryclinton

"Maybe that's part of the point. It's a wedge issue against democrats. Even if he doesn't plan to rejoin, just bringing it up causes conflict among the left.",smocca,dx9y5aj,hillaryclinton
Appreciate that!,patcakes,dxa8tbf,hillaryclinton
"I think Republicans were always jealous of Bill Clinton. He was the last president that created a tax surplus with a robust economy. If I remember, even after Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton left with a 60% approval rating. Republicans did everything they could to damage them Clintons, and it worked. The Clinton family was never more shady than Republican politicians. Republicans created wars, took corporate money, had private servers under Bush, had their version of Benghazi, and their own mistresses. Newt Gingrich was the most epic example of hipocrisy. He hunted for Bill Clinton's Monica Lewinsky scandal, while turning around and having TWO mistresses. One of those wives had cancer while he was ducking around. Republicans only seen to think Democrats should be punished and called corrupt, but when they do it, It's okay. They lead to the worship of Trump. He can't do anything wrong. So when someone tells you they want ""normal Republicans"" back from Trump, just remember those normal Republicans created the support base that lead to Trump. 

Democrats, however, can't seem to do right in the eyes of the left. Bernie and his progressives are willing to crash the Democrats and make them lose, rather than joining and helping. Problem is the right attacks Dems as taking people's hardworking tax dollars, their guns, and allow the ""murder of babies, and as anti-white. The left of Dems attacks them for not being progressive in the way they please. They want taxes raised, but these Bernie bros keep insisting Trump won because Hillary wasn't progressive enough. That logic doesn't make sense because the majority of Trump voters were lifelong Republicans that want lower taxes and privatizing everything. Why would they vote for self proclaimed socialist that wants to raise their taxes to pay for ""lazy people""?",Capitalisticliberal,dx99y6s,hillaryclinton
"Yeah, I didn't really pay attention to politics until about halfway through the Bush years.  I like Bill and I just looked up her record when it became clear she was the likely nominee and came away with ""She's not perfect, and the two have a weird penchant for relatively benign cutting of corners - but, ultimately, they've spent the lat 30 years in public service and have accomplished more than 99.9% of people could ever dream of to help others.""

"""Qualifications"" are the sort of thing people only get excited about once they already agree with someone politically or want them to win badly for some other reason. Then all of a sudden if they're well-qualified, it becomes the big obvious justification for why supporting them is objectively ""right"" and supporting anyone else is objectively ""wrong"" and ""stupid"".

Since there's never been a woman President, women who cared a lot about that assumed her qualifications would be a huge card to play against her male opponents. But nobody cared, that is, nobody who didn't already think she was a good fit for office based on their own political metrics. So now, like some sort of PTSD cases, her adherents are left insisting ""qualifications"" have always been the best thing to look for in candidates, and it's a big strange absurd farce that the most ""qualified"" candidate didn't win -- even though that happens at least half the time if not actually more.

The fact remains that both politicians and the populace largely insist on keeping up the polite fiction that qualifications and fitness to be president are among the most important criteria by which we elect them.

People who point out how the most qualified candidate in modern times lost to the least qualified candidate in modern times are doing so in order to show up that polite fiction **as fiction.** We are trying to point out how this election showed us to be liars.

"Republicans are the corporate party because they take corporate money. A good chunk of the democratic party also take corporate money. The difference is that usually all the Republicans fall in line with the establishment so they can actually push through their gross agenda while the democrats are almost always split on every issue because half of them take so much money from the rich, so whatever gets done is an extremely watered down version of what the left actually wants. 

Obamacare is a great example. What the left wanted was a single payer Healthcare system, but Obama (who was a great president don't get me wrong) didn't like negotiating, so he went right to the compromise which would have been a public option. Republicans used this as an advantage by then making a compromise of the compromise: an individual mandate system which is the old-school republican idea.

War is another great example. When Obama took office, he didn't hold Bush or the republicans accountable for entering a war with a country that didn't attack us. In fact, he expanded it by getting us into 7 interventions (trump got us into an 8th one). 

The most embarrassing one might've been when Obama introduced gun reform and an incredibly watered down background check didn't even pass. 

Republicans have taken the democrats shift to the middle as an opportunity to go extremely right-wing. This happened because democrats thought people would think the democrats would seem so much more reasonable by compromising, but humans are inherently tribalistic and many don't actually care about the policies, they care about their team winning. Donald Trump is a great example, who rallied against war in the primaries and Republicans backed him up (nows he's super pro war and Republicans are still backing him up because this is about ""yea that's my guy, that's my team, go us"" mentality). 

Basically what I'm saying is that if democrats stop taking corporate money, real progressives will win primaries because they aren't facing up against fundraising (by the very wealthy) from the economically center right democrats and there will be more than just a few real progressive voices in Congress. Then I think we can finally work on getting money out of politics. 

I view getting money out of politics as endgame because Republicans are really good at using their massive amount of money to advertise their policies that hurt the middle class to the middle class. (for example the estate tax was turned into the ""death tax"" because people went ""Oh shit, I'm gonna die. I don't want that to happen to me"" when it only affects an incredibly small amount of people and their bratty kids still get loads of money.

"Of course it counts as prejudices and propaganda. Women are literally never characterized as roguish, rebellious, or charming in a way that makes them good for presidency. When women are any of those things, that makes them sexually desirable at best (or more likely, sexually degenerate). When men are those things, they are lovable and trustworthy and you could have a beer with him, and of COURSE you'll vote them for president. 

It's pure prejudice and propaganda.

What we learned from the Obama candidacy is that some of the older prejudices and propaganda about the president needing to be seen as a ""safe"" person have been eroded enough (due to numerous sex scandals) which made it okay for a black man to be voted in despite being seen as inherently threatening to white womanhood. (It helped that Obama never shows anger or aggressiveness - he walked the tightrope well.)

"There's a case to be made. HW had only four years in the House compared to Hillary's eight in the Senate. Being RNC Chair is a political job that doesn't translate much to the Presidency. Bush is generally considered to edge her out on foreign policy - but he only spent two years at the UN, one at the CIA, and just over a year in China, so arguably four years as Sec State (which is more involved in policy-making) is at least a match for that.

HW probably wins out overall because he was Vice-President (and a very active one in Reagan's later years in office) which has a similar sort of general advisory role as Hillary's tenure as First Lady, but is more formal and powerful.

Every time I see this kind of argument about ""corporate money"" from ""progressives"" and Bernie Bros I wonder whether they/you realize the hypocrisy of these statements.

Well, he never jumped on last-minute to ""co-sponsor"" everyone else's work, but other than that he ""accomplished"" about as much as HRC. Which is very little. Senators as individuals generally cannot accomplish anything without a filibuster-proof and veto-proof majority of their colleagues, and we live in the era of partisan gridlock.

> both are dismissive of intersectionalism

Really? Class is one function of intersectionalism. By arguing very clearly and explicitly that we can't assertively tackle economic class issues ""because we still have racism, sexism and homophobia in this country"", HRC was the one denying an intersectional approach, that we need to separate them and address them in sequence.

"At the beginning of the 2016 election, nobody except people who paid really close to politics knew who Bernie was. When he announced he was running for president, it was barely even covered at all. Was Bernie Sanders really that close by the end? No, but I would argue there was a point pretty far into the primaries where it really looked like Bernie could have won. This was up against Hillary Clinton. That is one of the most recognizable names in current politics, so she has a massive advantage over Bernie. The billions of dollars she was able to fund raise didn't hurt either. ",thepebbletribe,dx2byrl,hillaryclinton
"I don't know why the party let him, just like I don't know why the Republicans wouldn't let Trump run as one of them.  Though at least Trump's been a Republican for a while now, even though Trump's more about Trump than anything else (having changed several times).  Maybe lack of interest was part of it.  But honestly, I think in 2020, both the non-Trump Republicans and the Democrats really need to choose one person to rally behind.  It was a crowded Republican primary that got us Trump.",kerryfinchelhillary,dx4fjtb,hillaryclinton
"The reality is that he lost in a landslide by 3.7 million votes.

The hype about him was artificially pushed by Russian financed ads and he dug into sexist talking points just like the Trump campaign did. 

I don't actually think he wanted to win, it was more important to him to keep spewing one liners about how he knows everything so much better and with that hating on the democratic party. 

That was Sanders' job, badmouthing the democrats and taking votes away from Hillary Clinton.",,dx2f91b,hillaryclinton

No way would moderates have voted for him, and if people did their research, they'd know there's no way any of those proposals would get through Congress.  I think the only person in the world I hate more than I hate Bernie is Trump and there's nothing I'd love more than to see him lose his Senate seat.

All he ever talked about was policy. Hillary Clinton was the one that constantly used meaningless clichés like ""we need to break down the barrier"" and ""better together"".

Bernie was trying to pull democrats to the left. When going down all of Bernie's policies the American people are almost always incredibly favorable of them. It's the democrats own fault for not doing enough to get the progressive vote.

Nobody was excited for Hillary. Trump didn't get a ton of votes, democrats just didn't show up at the polls because they were overconfident and they didn't want to vote for someone who wanted to keep the system that was fucking over the average person the same.

""She isn't qualified to be president""

Bernie was never explicitly sexist but his surrogates and supporters were and he never did anything to dissuade that narrative.

>All he ever talked about was policy. 

Really? That's bullshit. Most of his campaign against Hillary was based on false smears about her ""speeches"". No basis or evidence for his allegations. That's not policy. 

When Bernie talked about policy - e.g. the NYDN interview, he fell short.

When confronted with the smears he made against her, he had no answer.

Don't be revisionist especially in this sub. Especially about Hillary cause you clearly have no idea what she talked about. 

She engaged in actually policy conversation. He did not. We have debates and transcripts which prove that.",,dxc5ysh,hillaryclinton

As much as I despise Bernie and his cult, I would have voted for him over Trump, but I will do everything I can to campaign for a real Democrat in 2020, and I donated money to the guy running against him in November.  I care about policies, which is why I got involved in politics in the first place, but he should not have run in our primary when he constantly trashed our party.  As for ""just stopping"" - there are things that should be done first.  Do something that the Republicans are more likely to agree to first.

">  almost all of which was based on her policies, decisions, and donors.

Um, again, please don't be revisionist here. His only attack against her was about the speeches and he painted her as corrupt for the speeches without any evidence. Not once did he actually question her policies in any meaningful way. That's why he lost the debates. You're trying to paint a very revisionist picture of the primaries. Please provide evidence.

>How dare he question she who felt entitled to the nomination!

And there you go, proving my point. It's only Bernie and his supporters who think she was entitled. No one else did because she was actually qualified. When you twist someone's qualifications and experience as ""being entitled"" then there's a definite prejudice there.",,dxc6o3t,hillaryclinton

Likewise, if someone says, I didn't like Obama because of ""Policy X, Policy Y, Policy Z"", that doesn't attack all minorities. I'm a PoC myself, and I'd rather have talks that discuss that strengths and weaknesses of all candidates, both past and current, than shy away from it. Pointing out their faults does not detract from their accomplishments, Obama obviously will go down in history, as will Clinton for their strides in their fields, given that they do not match the traditional layout of a male, White politician. They're both accomplished individuals, but that does not make them perfect. Those who don't observe history, are doomed to repeat it. I dislike Trump, but I think looking at why Clinton lost and understanding what happened is key to ensuring a candidate such as Trump does not take office. ",poo-c__e-tur,dx1e820,hillaryclinton
