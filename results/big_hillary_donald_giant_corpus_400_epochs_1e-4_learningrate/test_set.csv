8,8,1,"i miss comey showing some regret for his harsh comments on hillary when he announced the fbi closed the investigation. he clearly broke the protocol and i believe it was his ego doing it. however, loretta lynch should've recused herself and hand the case down to sally yates. but that doesn't excuse comey.he explained his decision to reveal the reopening of clinton investigation but to keep quiet about the investigation into the russia's meddling with the elections and possible links to the trump campaign. i still believe that he should've included a warning about the foreign adversary's attempts to disrupt the election and possibly swing it to trump, thus making his letter about the current state of the play. chaffetz would've though twice whether to leak it or not. maybe that would've started a much needed conversation about the meddling, fake stories, russian trolls and cyberwar. hillary's emails wouldn't be the one and only issue to nibble on."
9,9,1,reminder that literally all of this bullshit could have been avoided
10,10,1,watch bernie try to take credit for this...
11,11,1,"> hillary clinton on tuesday said ""civility can start again"" in the united states only if democrats win back the house or the senate in november's midterm elections.> > clinton, who made the comments in an interview with cnn, added that ""you cannot be civil with"" the republican party because it ""wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.""> > ""that's why i believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the senate, that's when civility can start again. but until then, the only thing that the republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength,"" clinton said.> > and you heard how the republican members, led my [senate majority leader] mitch mcconnell [r-ky.], the president, really demeaned the confirmation process, insulted and attacked not only dr. ford but women who were speaking out,"" she continued. ...> > ""so when you're dealing with an ideological party that is driven by the lust for power, that is funded by corporate interests who want a government that does its bidding, it's  you can be civil, but you can't overcome what they intend to do unless you win elections,"" she added. spot-on and accurate quote from clinton that rings true about the world of politics. they are the party of corporations and oligarchs, who care about nothing but power: years of obstruction under obama, all the while calling him a tyrant, and now look at the way they force their unpopular views upon the majority of the populace, blatantly disregarding their wishes."
12,12,1,"comey is no hero, he's foremost self serving. trump just happened to bruise his ego and now he's after trump. "
13,13,1,"no, it holds up just fine. worst rebuttal ever."
14,14,1,i think nevada and az look hopeful (rosen and sinema) for the senate.but if the dems lose even one seat those two wont help

16,16,1,"i've always found the religious right hypocritical, but especially after they've started supporting someone like trump.  even before trump, i found them hypocritical that they called themselves ""pro-life"" but tended to be anti-welfare, anti-universal healthcare, etc."
17,17,1,i can't see why he doesn't understand the needs of all demographics and don't see many differences between him and her. can you elaborate?
18,18,1,"yep.my county had more than 350,000 people cast votes as per this map, but you can't find us without a microscope.  meanwhile, some rural place in montana has 400 people, but is a huge swath of red because of its size. last time i checked, land masses couldn't vote. "
19,19,1,yes! she is on point here about identity politics. perfectly said. i really really do hope that the democrats start recognizing her worth leading in to 2020.
20,20,1,"it had plenty of upvotes early this morning, then the berners woke up and the downvoting started.just amusing how they still think they can control our sub after we beat their lame candidate two years ago and after most if us experienced the sexism in this very sub for a full year...we didnt care back then, why should we now"

35,35,1,"my main issue is there doesn't seem to be respect for other opinions or an understanding of where they come from, and i mean that in a very broad sense. i randomly checked in here, don't think i've been here since 2016, and i was surprised by the tweet. i didn't think hillary was still active politically and i didn't know this sub was active either. this post reached r/all, and i saw a comment that was basically the same reaction i had to seeing it. then i saw it was getting downvoted, and the user i've been going back and forth with was being very personal and hostile toward that person. it reminded me of the general feeling i've always had when i come here. i unsubbed a long time ago because the culture here is actually kind of toxic. so i said something along those lines. i notice the same things in r/politics. so many conservatives have liberal stances when you question them in a way that doesn't trigger them. so many of them are looking for the door. but they feel unwelcome by liberals, because there is an endless stream of shaming and ridicule toward them. this approach will never persuade anyone. it drives people to entrench themselves. if you want people to join you, you have to respect where they currently are and seek common ground and common goals, then maybe if you're lucky the differences will become common ground too. for such a prominent political figure it's always struck me as bizarre how exclusive and hostile her subreddit is. liberals seem so convinced that they have the moral and intellectual high ground that they're oblivious to how they are perceived and how much they alienate potential allies. i don't care about mean comments from internet strangers. it was annoying for maybe a few minutes. i care about unifying the lower and middle classes. projection and lack of mutual respect is a pervasive issue and a major obstacle to that. i commented because of the condescending hostility i saw toward another user for having the wrong reaction to the post. this sub and this public figure got some rare visibility on this site and screwed it up. it makes hillary and liberals look bad. i think a lot of people have checked in here and decided not to stick around. there's no reason why hillary couldn't have a  comparable presence to bernie on this site. i think this sub, and liberals in general, shoot themselves in the foot. "
36,36,1,"right, i acknowledge that. my point is that those of us who fell for the propaganda propagated it ourselves. i was a pretty evangelistic sanders supporter until i realized what a self-serving ass he is."
37,37,1,amazing. this is the most shes ever done for us sheep. such courage to walk through rain 
38,38,1,"so what you're saying isn't true to you? because that's what i was implying. and false sense of authority? the only one that has a false sense of authority here, is the guy telling me what is and isn't true based on my own opinion. keep talking, you're making yourself look very smart right now."

42,42,1,">perhaps the hardest truth for many people to accept in the entire comey saga is the possibility (likelihood) that donald trump and james comey are both terrible. that there might not be a hero in this particular story.>or that there was, and comey made not *a* but *the* deciding factor in the election that would otherwise have made her our president.yep"

52,52,1,not sure i understand your question?
53,53,1,im not surprised in the least. trump is a lying criminal.
54,54,1,"she caused trump.the amount of votes stein got in states like mi and pa would have gotten hillary elected.she didnt care about immigrants, and minorities who practically begged the holier than thou purity left to protect them when it mattered.she protests now because she's a grandstanding jackass who loves to get publicity.when everything is said and done she returns to her 9 million dollar house to sip champagne while rome burns.she's literally everything thats wrong with the regressive alt left.she eats, breathes and lives white privilege.frankly: pure neo nazis are less evil than susan fucking sarandon."
55,55,1,the link gives me a 404 error. 
56,56,1,"i don't think that's at all true. think about the united states when the constitution was being written: a bunch of states worried about what it means to give up their sovereignty. the small states wouldn't have joined without assurances that they would continue to have a say in how the nation is run. for example, the new jersey delegation's proposal had the president elected by a congress where each state received one equal vote. the drafters of the connecticut compromise (basically the system we have today) was very well aware that the electoral college it created would serve to ensure a geographically diverse national support for a presidential candidate. it serves that purpose quite well. if you imagine an election with two presidential candidates, where each gets 50% +1 votes in each state they win, the most lopsided scenario possible where one candidate wins the electoral vote without the popular vote still has the winner earning 49.6% of the vote. "
57,57,1,i would expect some media from pro-bernie content producers to show up here intermittently if it has an anti-trump/republican message. i am surprised though that basically /r/sandersforpresident content from the bernie news corporation (tyt) has modest support here. this is not a flattering video for clinton.
58,58,1,"where did i imply you were a berniebro?believe me, if i even thought that, i'd mute you in a second.you're still here to pick a fight about a critical article about bernie's organization on the hillary sub.oh yes, you so supported her, but her campaign sucked, got it./rolls eyes"
59,59,1,w.t.f.any clearer indication of why we have trump? the 4th estate has become a sham.

70,70,1,"id be interested to see her run a campaign as a primary candidate and go from there, at the very least. what are your thoughts on kristen gillibrand?"
71,71,1,"if the results tonight are the same as 2016, this country deserves anything and everything it gets. i cannot imagine what more needs to be said and done to get people to vote. if they don't want to vote, then fuck them. let the gop fuck this country over, it's poetic justice at that point."

126,126,1,"in this discussion, you'd probably be right. though the headline is a little simplistic and crass, the author makes clear what they're talking about.i was genuinely reacting to the idea that the term ""identity politics"" is itself forbidden anymore. seriously if not that i'd like some term to describe the phenomena of radicalizing around relatively superficial group-based identities in the manner of a zero-sum game -- and often the cynical manipulation of those identities for ideological or other political purposes -- over grounding our mission for liberation from bigotry in a recognition of our profound common humanity. and i don't think ""tribal politics"" would be taken any better."

144,144,1,">  because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. no, where do you read that out? it says, that not everyone who is from a minority is automatically progressive. thats why i gave you some examples, almost no left-leaning liberal would prefer a female/latina/black republican over a male/white/heterosexual (progressive) democrat. >  because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. it might be that he thinks a lot more in terms of class than other politicians do (if they do it at all) because he says he is a socialist. but still he made clear quite a lot that racial and gender justice is really important (to him).> bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative.come on.. i am pretty sure bernie knew hillary clinton from their time in senate together.. > maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a latina woman.he could have done that. but i don't know the centext.. i have searched for quite a bit but didn't found an article with the full question but i found one with the full (long) answer. yes, he could simply have asked what she wants to change or whats to do and when she replied he could than have said ""okay, thats great"" or ""yeah, thats not enough"". but what he could also have done is say that it is really important go get enough minoritiy candidates into politics but they also have to be progressives. i don't see a problem there. (even tough his statement beginns with ""let me respond to the question in a way you may not be happy with"", so its probably more than ""i want to be the first latina.."" but a real question)> you're the one, like bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing.where am i beeing very arrogant? and where am i reducing identity politics as a negative thing?> i mean bernie called her unqualified and his campaign manager branded her ""ambitious"" because she wanted to run for president.bernie replied to her, when she said that bernie didnt do his homework and that doesnt understand how to break up big banks and voters should ask themselves if he can deliver what he promises. then bernie just replied ""theyre going to question my qualifications, so i am questioning theirs."" and he repeated the same in a debate (""you might wonder about your qaulifications madame secretary"". and then he said why he is questioning them: iraq war, trade agreements, super pacs, wall street. yes, this might be a bit childish (bernie said that ""we"" shouldnt get into that tit-for-tat) but i dont think its sexist. it is basically ""being a women is not enough"" because you have to stand up against big banks and not take their money. and the ""ambitious"" thing is actually another context.. but okay, i am not here to say that every member of the campaign is perfect. but its a bit far-fetched to say that bernie reduced clinton to her identity because his campaign manager says, that she has ambitions to be president... thats basically a fact for (nearly) every candidate.> he dismissed trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction.no he said that this is shameful and its probably not against clinton but this would be against all women. a quote of the interview: ""maybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing america. donald trump will not look quite so interesting in that context."" he is not saying, that abortion rights are not important (which is insane to say if you know his voting record and his engagement for women rights.> and then there's his hardcore supporters coming after hillary supporters as vagina voters.and then there is the hardcore supporters of hillary coming after bernie supporters (but again bernie supporters /=/ bernie) who say that there is a special place in hell for women who dont support clinton. or that young women support bernie because they want to meet boys. or all the ""bernie bros"" that just support bernie because he is a man. > when he ran against a female governor of vermont he made it about her gender and how it would be sexist to vote for her because she was a womani dont know about the time, that was before i was born. what he said though is that many people are excited because she is a women but there is nothing more (because) he is the bigger feminist. i just dont know if that is true. but yeah, it would be sexist to vote for bernie if they just do it because he is a men. it is not (really) sexists to prefer a women over a men if you like them equally."

146,146,1,"god damnit i want her to be president so damn bad.  i love obama, don't get me wrong, but hillary would not have even bothered trying to do bipartisanship with the rapist republicans.  and that's why they feared her so much.  she would've done as much as she could to steamroll over them, and hell yeah i would've been right along side her 100%."

153,153,1,"bill maher said she was a bad candidate but would make a great president. and that is not a reflection on her. it is a reflection on society. they want smoke, lasers and charisma. it is our lack of effort to research and think critically. we want one-liners and drama. she was also treated so very unfairly. she was at the end of such undeserved hatred for no apparent reason. i am not advocating her perfection, no one is. but i think issues would have been dealt with very differently to how they are now.

157,157,1,"on another note, this entire fiasco demonstrated how completely disconnected and oblivious many old school political operatives had become in today's fast-paced online media wars.  it should have been obvious to anyone who spends more than 20 minutes online that this whole thing was going to blow up in their faces.ctr was a small operation with pretty tame goals.  but it became the bogeyman for *every single fucking comment* on reddit and around the internet that a) was not pro-trump, b) was not pro-sanders or c) was not anti-hillary.  so many political debates were casually dismissed with a ""well, you're obviously a ctr shill""  amidst a sea of approving upvotes.even today, i wonder if dave brocks has any clue just how damaging the whole thing was.  i fully understand the mission and goal (and the need) for ctr, but the project was handled terribly."
158,158,1,that would just encourage the gop to continue to massively lie about anyone they dont like as eventually it will work to remove that person from power.  lets not feed the trolls (gop) and lets just publicly and loudly correct the record.  nancy pelosi rocks.

196,196,1,you base your candidate off age? that is bizarre. why not sex or race?
197,197,1,how could anyone possibly need an article to understand the correlation 
198,198,1,"hey, you keep editing and deleting your comments - it's kind of hard to have a genuine conversation with someone who does that.where have i made assumptions about you? politics is always personal... i don't think i've insulted you - i'm going by the comments you have made - if you take that personally then maybe you shouldn't be engaging in these discussions and then feel offended.and yes bernie has everything to do with this - you talk about aoc and populism and dismiss hillary's primary win - it's not really hard to see what you're implying here. this has everything to do with bernie.>(such as joe biden, who tried to jump in in october '15 after his grieving process concluded, until party leaders up to and including obama warned him they'd rake him over the coals. again, not the typical experience of a candidate. which brings us to nita lowey's experience in 2000, another case of red carpet treatment).and again, all of this is false. party leaders and obama didn't tell him not to run because they'd rake him over the coals... that's completely false. firstly that was not the reason and secondly neither obama or any party leader was part of his decision and he's spoken about this. so it's curious where you're getting these ""facts"" from? and if you read his book, you'll see that he and hillary had discussed running against each other and were okay with it as long as they didn't run negative campaigns against each other. again, these are facts not ""establishment/party"" conspiracies which you keep trying to imply.and also about lowey's experience - she dropped out and was even supporting hillary for the seat before she dropped out.  it's not red carpet treatment at all. this is what people who support their party do. also by this logic, the party would have probably not bernie run since he was an independent but of course that's not true because it's not the party at play here. you seem to be insinuating that hillary was gifted all her elections - can you say that about her re-election to the senate? and if she had a red carpet treatment how did they let obama run against her in 2008? and if that was the case then why did they let bernie and all the rest of the dem nominees run against her in 2016? this is nothing personal but if you're engaging in a discussion and make some clearly false claims then be expect to be questioned. you clearly have a fixed perception of hillary which has emerged through your comments and it has nothing to do with her policies. you're in a hillary sub... like why are you offended if someone calls you out on it?and just for the sake of it... you would have preferred biden to run? according to what you've said, how exactly would he have been different as president with a gop house and senate?again, don't take it personally - i'm simply responding to your words.

210,210,1,"thanks, you too!!"
211,211,1,no shit. i don't give a fuck anymore. communism is the only way forward.
212,212,1,"so last night i cut my ankle while taking out the trash.  i'm not even sure what did it, all i know is that i felt liquid on my ankle and looked down, and sure enough, it was bleeding.  so i went inside and tried to clean it off.  the blood kept coming.  in fact, it took me an hour to stop the bleeding, and even once the bleeding stopped, every time i so much as walked across the room, i started bleeding again.  after another hour of that, i went to the er.  again, i was humiliated at the er by my blood leaking and my shoe being drenched in blood as i walked from my uber to check in.  i spent four hours waiting in an exam room.  turned out i needed stitches - which i suspected when the bleeding wasn't stopping.  they also did a tetanus shot since we don't know what caused the bleeding and some blood work to make sure nothing was infected.and all i can think about is - what's the bill going to be like when it comes?  i don't make a lot of money.  i have health insurance through my job, but there was a copay last night, there could be more."
213,213,1,theres that video of him saying creepy things to teenage daughters of congress-people getting their pictures taken. i might have previously dismissed that as old awkward man being old and awkward but in light of all that weve seen in the last few years it pulls at my stomach. shame really because i think hes a very effective communicator and popular in eastern pa which is important. 
214,214,1,">the president of the united states was fleeced, and worse, has no doubt impressed upon kim that this country can be played for fools and strung along. trump gave kim newfound legitimacy and kims nuclear weapons program can go on and on.>in all of this, **pompeo**, trumps secretary of state, bears a good deal of the responsibility for excessive happy talk. he apparently was led along as well, resulting in the decision to put trump in the room with kim. *pompeo has insisted that this would not be a repeat of past errors. hes right on that. this is much, much worse.* national security adviser **bolton**, who tried his best to disrupt the meeting, can feel some measure of satisfaction. having seen his advice spurned and the disastrous results that followed, he might consider quitting. he would be a powerful, independent voice to explain the peril in which we now find ourselves with a president who alienates allies and gives tyrants around the globe reason to celebrate."
215,215,1,"kavanaugh was hostile to democratic senators, especially women. he's temperamentally unfit to be any kind of judge, let alone supreme! "
216,216,1,"there's a case to be made. hw had only four years in the house compared to hillary's eight in the senate. being rnc chair is a political job that doesn't translate much to the presidency. bush is generally considered to edge her out on foreign policy - but he only spent two years at the un, one at the cia, and just over a year in china, so arguably four years as sec state (which is more involved in policy-making) is at least a match for that.hw probably wins out overall because he was vice-president (and a very active one in reagan's later years in office) which has a similar sort of general advisory role as hillary's tenure as first lady, but is more formal and powerful. but other than him, hrc was more qualified than pretty much any other candidate in years (excluding incumbent presidents of course)"
217,217,1,"not sure why you think i get all my information from fox.  and once again it is proven that when people want to have a discussion all that happens is the other side resorts to calling people idiots and tell them how it's been explained over and over.  your refusal to acknowledge the facts on both sides shows your inability to find a compromise and solution.  that is why we are where we are today.  everyone fully understands the difference, but the left refuses to acknowledge the fact they did shit about it when it was happening on their watch.  kids were literally in cages, unlike today...  but, yeah it was totally different!  get the fuck outta here with your bullshit.the best part is the left just sits out there and screams, ""look at these poor children""! oh, the horror of being fed, clothed and sheltered unlike where they just escaped from...  but, hey you wanna make it political and play stupid fucking games, cool.  trump will sit there and let it happen, because he didn't make the rule he just enforced zero tolerance with it.  so, tell me again how it's trump's fault?  he did not create the problem...  congress let it happen!  period!"

234,234,1,"i think it was the media deciding to never ever cover hillary's policy proposals - something they have never done to a male candidate, just to her.great example being the foreign policy debate where the moderator used all clinton's time harassing her about the email-non-story and wouldn't actually let her talk about foreign policy.i don't see much reason to pretend it wasn't sexism."

271,271,1,these guys look exactly how i would expect them to look. 
272,272,1,hillary would be proud :)
273,273,1,"i think you'll find that the majority of hillary supporters have always wanted to move on and were never about pointing fingers until bernie bros kept attacking with ""bernie would have won"" or ""rigged dnc"" at every chance.  there's a limit to the harassment and smears we should tolerate. thankfully, we did speak up and continue to do so against these people... especially ones who were imposing these purity tests. if we kept quiet and let them control the narrative then we would be in a worse position - bernie candidates are consistently losing. they're not the majority. they're not the base. i feel your comment is misplaced here.it seems more suited to a bernie sub, no offense. the alternative is not to keep pointing fingers. the alternative is to stand up for ourselves and everyone who won the majority vote."
274,274,1,"> who i have since cut ties withthere's been a lot of that.  trump really fucked with the fabric of our nation.  my grandmother had been going to the same church for twenty years, after the election her ministers sent a letter to the whole congregation discussing how elated they were to finally have a christian (pence) in the white house. that same day my grandmother wrote a letter back, outlining the importance of the word of christ, the 10 commandments, and how little her ministers knew about what it means to be christian.    i'm pretty sure they got a lot of letters like that, because she got another letter next week, begging her and everyone else to come back.    i hate that people are losing loved ones over politics, but how can i be friends with someone who voted for a pussy grabbing rapist that wants to bomb children?  i *don't want* to know that person."
275,275,1,"gillibrand and klobuchar get a lot of attacks from the right, too."
276,276,1,"it was nice to see obama stepping up more to criticize trump. i know that there is an unspoken rule that past presidents shouldn't be too involved, but this is not a normal time.the unsuccessful candidate also usually isn't too involved, but this is again different. it is great to see hillary stepping up her profile, not just to discuss her own mistakes but to directly criticize america's biggest mistake, donald trump.maybe she will run in 2020 and maybe she won't, but either way we need her voice."
277,277,1,">hillary clinton lost the presidency not only because of the anti-obama backlash, but also because we democrats went slack, then did what we so often do  we fought among ourselves.>granted, russia helped trump. it may even have been the difference when you look at how close the vote was in states like wisconsin, michigan, pennsylvania and florida that put trump over the top.>but every berniecrat who couldnt get over it, every democrat who saw the election as the choice of two evils and sat it out, every unengaged citizen who didnt engage  they contributed to our arrival at the point where everything weve gained since brown vs. board of education is at risk."
278,278,1,"i'm not denying that racism exists, but everyone has the same rights.>since you're really quite oblivious about the lack of equal rights - a white man in texas won't get asked for papers but a brown man will. probably because illigal immigration from mexico is a crime, and people from mexico have brown skin.

280,280,1,"i voted for her without reservations, defended her throughout and in the aftermath.  i honestly just don't want to see her go through this again.  i've got a bernie bro acquaintance who, to this day, will still waste more breath talking shit about hillary -- and defending trump/trump supporters.  there are people who will refuse to budge.  it's going to be a crowded field of candidates as it is.  i love her but i hope she doesn't go through this again."
281,281,1,i'm all for the narrative here but wtf are you talking about? bernie endorsed and spoke on her behalf at the convention.
282,282,1,"im for women having whatever choices they want. with their money, not mine. birth control? fine, pay for it. abortion? fine, pay for it. kids? great, you raise em and you feed em. "
283,283,1,this is pretty incorrect. trump never ran on the idea of home loans getting repaired or any other offer about those who lost their homes 10 years ago...right now (august 2018) the republicans are not running on anything for the mid-terms near the idea of offering home loan banking corrections. trump hasn't lost one person in his original base because of this. trump ran on and won because of racism other white people saw clinton as an extension or 4(8) more years of obama and they did not want it. there is no such thing as economic anxiety 
284,284,1,"why?the left refuses to even give warren, let alone harris a chance.."

305,305,1,reading this article and others gives me a pain in the stomach.  like it had been kicked by a braying cabal of low-information idiots hell-bent on hate for all the great things america represents.
306,306,1,"i think this was an answer to me?i think the problem is that the dccc basically needs to spread its resources, money and training and so on.i dont always agree with their decisions, for example when they picked bryce over myers, but i can only assume/ see the polling shows bryce stands a chance and myers doesnt."

318,318,1,that's sad.  i didn't agree with a lot of bush's policies but at least he and barbara seemed like genuinely nice and caring people.  
319,319,1,she's certainly been an inspiration to me!  i'm glad so many others feel the same way.

321,321,1,"there was only one who rigged the primaries and that was bernie.facts matter, dumbf*ck.he stole hillary's campaign data and he used russian bots to promote his campaign. wait until mueller finishes and we learned the full extent of tad devine's coopration with manafort."
322,322,1, 
323,323,1,if you're going to ask a honest question then do it on honest terms... she hasn't endorsed any individual and instead has been supporting progressive groups. why are you trying to make this an issue here in an extremely disingenuous way? 
324,324,1,i... i am actually surprised. that's good to know.
325,325,1,not surprising but i still pity the fool.
326,326,1,total trash. you know when giuliani is being brought back in the national conversation by trump that he's at a real low point. all he's got left is to turn back to the trolls like giuliani to do his bidding.
327,327,1,"the article doesn't mention anything about a new factory being built in china, nor whether the us was even in the running, and makes it sound as if they're shuttering the existing factory in sc. i mean it's basically a lie, can you not see that?"

348,348,1,"how is it anti bernie?did you even read the article?the article documents that under nina turner or has become a shit show.it documents that long time bernie surrogates like lucy flores have left the organization and that others are close to leaving.it also states more than once that bernie is critical of these developments.bernie did not endorse assad/ trump lover kucinich.if anything, the article is anti nina turner because she's killing bernie's movement.and fyi: that criticism has nothing to do with hillary.but if all fails: attack hillary, cuz we know the bros lack any kind of critical thinking."
349,349,1,"wow, this sub is just sad. i hope you all go on to live happy, fulfilling lives."
350,350,1,he'll cater for his base one way or another. popcorn president 
351,351,1,you make a fair point about this essay - a lot of people post it without context or explanation and it's sort of become a meme for people who don't like bernie but it's definitely not to trigger past traumas - it's more about pointing out the  hypocrisy surrounding him especially from his most ardent supporters who refuse to address his past in any way.and in terms of relevance to this post -actually it is very relevant to both the post and the op's comment especially if you read his full essay and understand what he's saying about gender roles (which the npr article does not). his essay is a perfect example of how women face different standards from men. how they're judged differently from men.  and this comes out in his essay not from what he says about women but how he says it. he focuses on the woman who fantasizes about being subjugated. he focuses on the woman about choosing different parts of her self and soul. he doesn't apply that same standard to the men. that says a lot.it might be 45 years old but this essay explains a lot about how bernie treats women's issues in the modern day. i feel like people should take the time to understand that.
352,352,1,"let's be clear:warren can go courting the votes from those berners who were nothing but being vindictive assholes for her when she endorsed hilary. didn't she just appear on a panel with michael moore and bernie and told ppl that ""stormy daniels and russian things are distraction""?well, she can ask these assholes for their support. i won't give her mine. especially when she said the primary was ""rigged""."
353,353,1,"had she resigned in 2013 when the senate was majority democrat, obama could have safely nominated a much younger, equally progressive judge to replace her without any problems from the reactionary anti-woman bigots from the far-right.  now we are all screwed with a virulently hostile to democratic ideals sc."
354,354,1,why not? ivanka is setting herself up for a political run.
355,355,1,i agree with all of this.  and we need to be very careful to not let them win the midterms.
356,356,1,read women &power by mary beard!she creates a direct link from antiquity and the way in which women were silenced and ridiculed in art and literature to hillary's treatment.

359,359,1,"interesting read.  though myth #2 definitely feels real, at least when it comes to congress and the trump supporters i know."
360,360,1,and the idiot does not even notice anything is missing! 
361,361,1,"if you want a repeat of the 2016 elections by alienating core constituencies through blanket statements like the above, go ahead, blame men. if there is anything to be learned from the rise of the current president, its that overly sanctimonious vitriol directed against people solely for belonging to a cohort will not gain their vote - what exactly do you think will happen if you tell people that their views are less legitimate because they happen to be white, male, heterosexual, etc? a large part of democracy is finding someone who represents you - and a large part of the reciprocal game of politics from the politicians perspective is to make sure that their views do indeed reflect their constituencies. ignore realpolitik at your own peril. "
362,362,1,your a joke! ya im sexist because i was on this sub constantly backing clinton treating her like a queen! no! you can be old and keep running as long as you show your staying up to date with the issues facing americans! bernie is doing that! hes showing his age has not gotten to his head and let it stop him from opening to new ideas! feinstein and pelosi barely just got on board for legal weed recently when the state they represented supported it by 60% are you kidding me? thats my issue with age! get old man and old women who wont evolve with the issue out of the federal government! 
363,363,1,"youre welcome of course to read the federalist papers (specifically 68) where the people who wrote the constitution described their intentions for how the ec was to function. were there other reason for it, such as getting slave states to join? sure, but thats conflating the why with the how. "
364,364,1,"really? because bernie's whole thing has supposedly been about energizing voters. he does it with his angry old man energy, not by instilling doubt. stats show that instilling doubts only adds to voter apathy. he knows this."
365,365,1,"i do like her, but i still think we need to see who else will step in. no one of all the potential hopefuls has really jumped out to the forefront yet."
366,366,1,youre okay with republican representation as long as they are female? does that really help? michelle bachmann was as bad as any man.

372,372,1,i feel like warren is very similar to sanders in the way he tends to ignore issues of social inequality to focus more on issues of financial wrongdoing. however she is actually a registered democrat. and thats a good quality in democratic nominees. hickenlooper is someone i respect immensely and is loved in his purpleish state. havent even thought about castro as president.

391,391,1,"i think it's important that the actions of the gop as a whole are categorically rejected by voters.most of all i just want to express to the person i was replying to that whatever disagreement there is between moderate democrats and progressives, it pales in comparison to the gulf between all democrats and republicans. it is kind of offensive that someone would suggest the more progressive democrats are a wedge that can be used to peel off some more support for this republican party.and honestly i don't see why any decent person would remain associated with republicans at any level. it's not like local government happens in a vacuum. they still live in this country and are seeing everything we are seeing every single day. quietly supporting what the national gop is doing is not okay."

408,408,1,"the polls were basically right in 2016, though...people were (and evidently still are) bad at reading them.the national polls predicted that clinton would win the popular vote by 3% and she won by 2%.the state levels polls in the midwest showed her having a small lead but being one small systematic error away from losing.  this is why fivethirtyeight, which relies mostly (albeit not entirely) on polling, concluded that clinton had a 70% chance of winning. that conclusion still seems right, given that 60,000 total flipped votes  between mi, pa, and wi could have turned the election the other way.(the good thing is that, if tuesday is any indication, those states are likely to swing back to the dems in 2020)."

410,410,1,sadly people still are denying it had an affect on the elsection. the worst are the bernie bros. and the only one that seems to give her credit is rachel maddow.
411,411,1,"furthermore...>  beierly rants about the collectively treachery of the girls in his high school. beierly says at one point, there are whores in  not only every city, not only every town, but every village. he argued that women who were in mixed-race relationships had betrayed their blood.>  i moved on her like a bitch. but i couldnt get there. and she was married. then all of a sudden i see her, shes now got the big phony tits and everything. shes totally changed her look.whatever your political affiliations, it seems to me only reasonable for the potus, the **first citizen**, the **princeps**, should be someone who tries to set a good example of how a person should behave.take mike pence.  i'm a liberal, i cannot stand the mans policies.  however, after the #magabomber attacks he *immediately* came to the defense of the targeted victims.  he behaved with a degree of grace and dignity that made me respect him.  our retired potus 43 was, imo, a headache in office.  however, he behaved and *behaves* in a manner that inspires respect and emulation.our current potus is a toxic influence who inspires anti-semites, misogynists and racists to murderous and bloody action.  he **must** go, and swiftly, or, it seems to me, the u.s.a. will descend into an even bloodier state of civil strife **that it is already in**.the gop has gone too far, and enough is enough."

420,420,1,so sam seder thinks that bernie won't run if warren runs and will be her greatest surrogate?? i mean that's just bullshit. if that's the case then bernie would already be campaigning for her instead of insinuating that he's running. and frankly we haven't got any hint that warren is going to run.this is all wishful conjecture from seder.if warren was going to run she would have done so in 2016. warren can certainly play a part and should but democrats need to move away from that generation of presumptive leaders. 
421,421,1,this website was so massively brigaded in 2016 it still stuns me.

427,427,1,"> in your comments, for one.my comments? how exactly? because i dared correct you? anyway my comments aren't her campaign... where exactly in her campaign did these sentiments pop up? you're talking about her campaign so please point it out.>though she didnt support gay marriage in her last campaignneither did obama. neither did bernie. it was the political climate of the time.it really seems you're picking and choosing comments out of context to try and prove your objections but failing miserably. and what does her husband's strategy have to do with her? again, it's pretty clear you didn't vote for her. why are you going out of your way to make it seem like that?"

433,433,1,lol. you really got me there. well done.
434,434,1,"so i find it funny that the media have resurrected the old ""democrats don't have a message"" while willfully ignoring the actual messaging from democrats except when it's trump or bernie using the democrats as a punching bag.there's plenty of democrat messaging going on yet you have publications like the daily beast publishing hillary bashing articles by gop strategists, passing them off as ""journalists"". i read this ""article"" from liz mair... a whole lot of garbage. she basically admits that bashing hillary is a public service to republicans like her.so how can the media legitimately criticize the democrats when they themselves publish partisan bullshit like this. yet again, bigoted trump supporters aside, we have the media proving why we have trump in the first place.

447,447,1,"it was nice to see obama stepping up more to criticize trump. i know that there is an unspoken rule that past presidents shouldn't be too involved, but this is not a normal time.the unsuccessful candidate also usually isn't too involved, but this is again different. it is great to see hillary stepping up her profile, not just to discuss her own mistakes but to directly criticize america's biggest mistake, donald trump.maybe she will run in 2020 and maybe she won't, but either way we need her voice."
448,448,1,do we owe anyone an explanation of why we post about anything in our sub?
449,449,1,"a heloc is not a bailout. it allows a homeowner to tap equity from their home. the ideal reason to do this is to eliminate high interest credit card debt or do much needed repairs on a home. a renewal heloc would have simply paid off the existing heloc, and then given the same terms as the first heloc for another 10 years. if anyone thinks that's a bailout then they are more hard hearted than republicans.as for trump, it was the combination of an agreement between hillary clinton and barack obama to not admit to anything that could look like an oversight or mistake, including not responding to bernie sanders and some crazy claims he was making against hillary clinton. then factor in obama's not so nice comment about the heartland having a lot of bible thumping, gun loving, bitter over losing jobs, people.the less hillary went into the heartland, the more the heartland felt that trump was the only candidate who was willing to not stay quiet and who did not want to raise taxes. i'm suggesting that hillary clintoin losing moderates to trump was a 1 or 2 proposition, every moderate hillary clinton lost meant two votes for trump."

455,455,1,"so to be clear, the article seems to admit there isn't actually any evidence that votes were in fact changed in the election.  as has been noted many times previously, quite a few voting ""systems"" were compromised in one way or another.  ie, a staff member's workstation was compromised at a county election board office.  the author here looks at the circumstantial evidence and concludes that the russians *must* have manipulated data in georgia's voting system.  but it's still just his own speculation."

471,471,1,point taken. i cant put into words how upsetting all this is. 
472,472,1,"a white mans life is different depending on the city, state and region you live in and economics plays a huge role.  if you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.  i didnt say white men are oppressed and i wont say their privileged either, they live a human life.  the homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him hes privileged and thats why you wont give him any money.even trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  if white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.a year ago i moved from oklahoma to los angeles.  the two cultures are so vastly different.  the democratic party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country thats why we are where we are at.  in oklahoma where i was apart of the democratic party, the hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in oklahoma as sexist and say thats why they wouldnt vote for clinton but at the very same time we had a female republican governor running the state.  texas, kansas, louisiana, arizona and many other red states have had female governors while states like new york and california have not.its not about privilege, race or gender its about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.  sad to say but democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican (trump  is not average).  obama brought people together clinton divided.  we all lost when her campaign started dividing people and it started long before trump got the republican nomination."

474,474,1,is this your standard response to anyone calling you out? if the party is failing it's because it's trying to accommodate people like you who can't even go beyond vague criticisms which you can't even substantiate.  the party will stop failing as soon as it realizes that people like you are only looking to divide not unite. that was the biggest failing in 2016.

493,493,1,"i despise the man. even more so after his media blitz where he says why he reopened hillary's investigation. he did so thinking that she'd still win and that shows foolishness because anyone with half a brain knows that there were people who hated hillary regardless of whether or not it was even true. with all the false narrative trump kept peddling, he should have known this would give trump an edge. most importantly, his hypocrisy in stating that she'd be riddled with scandals after she won if he didn't reopen the investigation. well, we're dealing with trump scandals daily thanks to his interference. he should be ashamed of himself."

499,499,1,he's a conservative but why does that make him an asshole?this way to see anyone with different opinions as the enemy is part of the problem imo.since his article in foreign policy december 2017 in which he describes how he always underestimated white male privilege and so on i actually kinda repect the guy.https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/27/2017-was-the-year-i-learned-about-my-white-privilege/

528,528,1,"hillary delivered some pretty critical commentary towards the administration lately and she might be anticipating that her own security clearance will be revoked as a consequence, like former cia director (and frequent trump critic) john brennan's was. when that happened, it dominated the news cycle for awhile. plus, the president revoking security clearances because he disagrees with them politically is not something that was done before trump.my interpretation of this is that hillary would rather voluntarily give up her security clearance rather than having it *revoked* because 1) revocation would create a bigger news story, the press would rehash 2016, and more important issues would be ignored and 2) she doesn't want to take part in establishing this new precedent of the president revoking security clearances for people he doesn't like. she wants to limit the ability of trump to politicize the security clearance process."

579,580,1,"everyone knows this.  the republicans choose to believe the lie, despite know it's a lie because it gives them a sense of hope.  if they worked hard enough, they could become like their dear leader.  rich, powerful, a man who does not face consequences.  deep down, they are like him, vindictive, mean spirited and willing to destroy for their own ends but because they do not posses the financial or political capital to bully others, they vicariously live through trump."
580,581,1,wrong maniac. the stickers-on-the-van guy was the mail bomber.
581,582,1,there needs to be a house select committee on voting rights and ballot access. keep it in the news.

583,584,1,hi i just wanted to give you guys your daily ls 
584,585,1,"exactly!!! just like that time when before the election hillary wore all white and was deemed by the media as ""looking very presidential in all white"".and then after the potus was elected the media painted melania as a racist and supremacist for wearing an all white gown.man why does everyone always hate on hillary :/"
585,586,1,"yes because discussing sexism a full two years after the election magically reverses history and changes the outcome.most misigynist pricks arent very bright, are you?"
586,587,1,same thing. both are illegal acts that change the result.
587,588,1,"this does not help anyone on our side, imo."
588,589,1,i miss you hillary. :(
589,590,1,i agree with that. 
590,591,1,"the thing is that linking to politifact *could* lead to donald trump's page, and he has, like, a 20/80 going on, it makes them *look* biased.    that one always bugged me too, though.  y' know even our worst candidates were pretty good, like, as human beings.  that's apparently saying something these days."

594,595,1,go away.
595,596,1,"she can.it would be hard, but anyone can win an election.she just needs to change her personality for some things and find right approach to people, because in usa it doesn't matter apparently what you have to offer and your policies, but rather it's a popularity contest.in fact anyone can win presidential election, especially celebrities from hollywood, because they know how to appeal to people, even though they would have no experience and have no idea what to do after they win.i mean we are having celebrity in white house now and we can all see what a disaster it is."
596,597,1,"as an american girl doll collector, i knew this was coming and got it the day it came out!  i really liked it!"
597,598,1,"oh trust me, if some people believed that that she was running a pedophile secret ring with podesta, faux news can literally come up with any bullshit story that have no facts or logic whatsoever and their followers would just believe it second after.they would believe anything and everything as long as it's bad for hrc.i don't know what is their deal or what's wrong with their brains, it seems like a sick obsession that they gave with her."

602,603,1,"your name says it all, troll! you're eating too much! chew harder!"
603,604,1,why are there so many recent articles questioning a possible comeback by hillary for 2020?  i really don't think she's planning to run again. she seems pretty busy and focused on other issues.
604,605,1,tsk. such a mouth on you.

609,610,1,the youngest generation of voters are not showing up to the polls.  why should i vote for what they want when they can't even do it for themselves?
610,611,1,"i think even if mueller's going to get fired, he probably has a plan in place to still bring down trump."
611,612,1,"oh i am not suggesting that hillary and bernie both had exact same policies.there were minor differences in their platform, but overall they had very similar concepts than we compare bernie and trump platform or hillary and trump.comparing to republican platform, both bernie and hillary had very similar ideas of what they want to do with some differences."
612,613,1,eh?did i miss something?
613,614,1,what middle america might want to see is a candidate good enough to go on shark tank for a season and do a good job. the balance between the environment and the economy will probably never sway entirely towards a consumer advocate only. obama killed that route when he sat idly by and allowed millions of homeowners to circle the drain when their 10 year old heloc's reset and the payments doubled or tripled.
614,615,1,"while there is some truth to that, i'd like to point out that risk assessment isn't the strong suit of the republican party either. 9/11 memorials stand as a testament to that. but when 9/11 happened, the democrats didn't help it happen or block the president from doing something to prevent it. "
615,616,1,"i don't necessarily disagree, which is why i said i'd have to look at the specific merits.  however, i do think the people arguing for it are doing so somewhat reflexively, and that concerns me.  i.e., i don't think they've really thought it through. either way, as far as i know, there isn't an actual debate.  there's just a few people tossing it around that i don't take all that seriously."
616,617,1,then how would the president get workers from eastern europe for his resorts and his brides?!
617,618,1,"i have a feeling that 50 or 100 years from now, the trump era is going to be talked about in history classes as one of the worst times in the history of this country."
618,619,1,"if you refuse to educate yourself that's up to you.however, since you show you know absolutely nothing about hillary:for lgtb, you can read this excellent twitter thread by long time lgtb activist lisa talmadge: it documents 30+ years of lgtb activism and solidarity from hillary:https://twitter.com/lisatalmadge/status/891714303438532608it shows how hillary was always there for us, how she worked behind the scenes, showed support for aids patients (which sanders never did), showed up in lgtb parades (which sanders never did) and how she worked to advance lgtb rights in her time as  sos.about poc:you can start by reading this excellent thread by mrweeks, documenting hillary's life long commitment to the cviil rights movement:the mods of this sub have written down the thread in this sub:https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/6n6mn7/brilliant_must_read_thread_by_mrdane_black/now i get it: you're one of those people who doesn't know anything about hillary's record. you fell for the far right's propaganda. but stating hillary defended the status quo, when in fact she was there for us for 30+ years or even worse: saying she wasn't a champion for women, makes you a first class asshole.and your pathetic: ""but i voted for her"", is about as genuine and dishonest as the average trump supporter.whether you support trump or bernie, i dont know, but frankly: it's impossible these days to keep those two groups apart."
619,620,1,"well, whoevers here still, im back at it. volunteering for katie hill on the weekends now. im back in the game "

621,622,1,thats my badass!
622,623,1,"ironically, hill still has more cred than anything republican. "
623,624,1,that might be a little over the top. lol
624,625,1,remember when trump said he hires the best people  he only hires criminals like himself
625,626,1,"same here. i'm in nj, so both of my senators and governor murphy have no problem telling trump to fuck off but this is all too much to take, i feel like donating and protesting is not enough, we've been doing that since the inauguration and things have been getting worse. ""it will get worse before it gets better"" has never been this true but jesus fucking christ, how much worse is it going to get? as a hispanic immigrant, even a naturalized one, i'm starting to fear for the time we get rounded up and locked up in cages with those who are already there. nothing is far-fetched anymore. "
626,627,1,"its kind of weird cause everyone know shes smart, and is friends with her in private. but in public everyone throws her under the rug, its shameful."
627,628,1,that's a slightly better medal imo than trump's commemorative one for the nk summit that never was.

632,633,1,"let's be honest, you are the one disagreeing with a source because of its name and not because of its arguments. i actually looked at the sources you sent me and raised questions about the conclusions you arrived at. if you have a problem with the national review's logic, i'd happily listen and consider it. this is why i really only referenced the sources you promoted. if you're just going to push out your bottom lip and take your ball home, i guess the conversation was never worth having to begin with because you were never going to evaluate an opposing idea honestly. additionally, any reasonable scientist would agree to the idea that there are plenty of complex ideas that science struggles to understand. they would also know that the qualitative reporting of surveys and polls of opinion do not substitute as empirical evidence to be used in solving major inquiries.

678,679,1,"once again, hillary demonstrates how a true american leader should observe this day."
679,680,1,there is a new group but it certainly isn't propping up candidates to the extent you're stating. aoc is the most high profile one but there certainly hasn't been others. all the gains from the democratic party has been from the base. let's not paint a revisionist picture of some kind of revolution from the far left taking over cause that's clearly not happening.and as for your sexist comment... it was sexist. period. using trudeau as a comparison is weak cause you're not in the right sub to make that comment.  and it stands out more when you make vague comments about her qualifications and policies yet make a pointed comment about her looks. 
680,681,1,so sam seder thinks that bernie won't run if warren runs and will be her greatest surrogate?? i mean that's just bullshit. if that's the case then bernie would already be campaigning for her instead of insinuating that he's running. and frankly we haven't got any hint that warren is going to run.this is all wishful conjecture from seder.if warren was going to run she would have done so in 2016. warren can certainly play a part and should but democrats need to move away from that generation of presumptive leaders. 
681,682,1,""" a year to do a lot of things ...?"" were you alive the first two years? the stimulus? by summer, the republicans had made healthcare the central issue and it consumed obama's agenda. i wish obama had dealt with immigration first, but he set the sights on health care. after the first two years, they did't have the votes."
682,683,1,good!!!!!
683,684,1,"i have never even understood the intense dislike of hillary although i accepted that people felt that way. i lived through the 90's and bill clinton's presidency and i never developed the ""bad taste in my mouth"" (per article) that so many report. on the contrary i grew to highly respect and really like hillary as a champion for children and families. so that being said, it is even harder for me to understand the people that couldn't ""bring themselves"" to vote for the democratic presidential candidate."
684,686,1,"i was going to say something about graham going to moscow recently, but probably i'm thinking of rand paul. anyone know about his connections to russia?graham is totally wrong about being addicted to raping women fro high school years on. i could imagine some secret society of georgetown prep hazing their ""recruits"" by making them do something like this. so graham you are wrong. it is possible to not be this type of person but still go through with it."

707,709,1,"ah ok.no, i have no idea if hfa had one.:(cant find it when i google it either."
708,710,1,why feel the need to lie
709,711,1,"fair. but perhaps we should take it seriously. its fairly easy. one can summarize what exactly you do to abolish it in two sentences based on reverse engineering the homeland security act of 2002restore the investigative and intelligence resources of the us custom service. partially reconstitute the immigration and naturalization services in the form of its, criminal investigative, detention and deportation resources. there. you abolished ice. the bureaucratic transition would be smooth because we already know how it worked before, and now you split the overly broad powers and massive budget of ice into two separate much easier to reign in parts. "
710,712,1,"but remember guys, a woman wouldn't have the temperament needed to be president "
711,713,1,"and that sanders had dump over $15 million into their own social media messaging firm revolution messaging by the time clinton spent $1 million.yet everyone claims $1m bought millions of paid shills on reddit despite the fact that multiple anti clinton articles were on the front page all throughout the primaries, through the summer and even a little after the convention.  but sure sander's had a purely grassroots following online, no shilling or message manipulation with the $25 million+ spent by the end and having active mods in r/s4p."
712,714,1,i'd be wary accepting this as fact. it's easy to make a paid actor post on craigslist and i would say that this is likely someone's attempt to created a conspiracy where none exists.
713,715,1,">hillary clinton lost the presidency not only because of the anti-obama backlash, but also because we democrats went slack, then did what we so often do  we fought among ourselves.>granted, russia helped trump. it may even have been the difference when you look at how close the vote was in states like wisconsin, michigan, pennsylvania and florida that put trump over the top.>but every berniecrat who couldnt get over it, every democrat who saw the election as the choice of two evils and sat it out, every unengaged citizen who didnt engage  they contributed to our arrival at the point where everything weve gained since brown vs. board of education is at risk."

715,717,1,to be fair most his voters are old so to them it means hillary rerunning...
716,718,1,"great point. he seems to become more brazen as time progresses and may get us into a situation we can't easily get out of, but i assumed pence would okay a d would progress the conservative's agenda with the help of republican house. "
717,719,1,this is pretty incorrect. trump never ran on the idea of home loans getting repaired or any other offer about those who lost their homes 10 years ago...right now (august 2018) the republicans are not running on anything for the mid-terms near the idea of offering home loan banking corrections. trump hasn't lost one person in his original base because of this. trump ran on and won because of racism other white people saw clinton as an extension or 4(8) more years of obama and they did not want it. there is no such thing as economic anxiety 
718,720,1,"i really don't think she would win if she ran again. if anything her running would energize the right all over again when that's the opposite of what you guys need, and she'd further divide the left. the right is too well versed on how to attack her and how to hit hard, it'd be better to have a candidate whose fairly unknown and can't be smeared through the mud as much and turn off moderates or people who are wishy-washy about the whole thing. historical precedence is not something to gamble four more years of trump against. "
719,721,1,theyre most in denial because it destroys the narrative that hillary lost because shes a bad candidate. also some of sanders campaign managers ties to russia and sanders voting records being exposed also may lead to something.
720,722,1,"yeah, me too.  i went to another state to go meet her, so..."

757,759,1,he's making a shitty hyperbolic strawman because he is incapable of making a real argument.
758,760,1,"tack-on 1:    in related news, it *seems like* i've been seeing a lot more of ""this is why trump won,"" and ""liberals think everyone is a nazi,"" and ""give me something to vote *for,""* and ""hillary clinton can't be trusted"" than normal, but i could just be imagining things.  confirmation bias is universal, y' know?  so i decided to check it out.  this synopsis is courtesy of hamilton 68:    >*[the #walkaway movement, a campaign highlighting alleged discord among the left, got a boost this week from accounts linked to russian influence operations. the first use of the #walkaway hashtag from accounts monitored on hamilton 68 was noted in early june (a few weeks after the grassroots campaign began), but engagement remained relatively low throughout the month. activity spiked on july 2, when hamilton 68 noted 73 unique tweets using #walkaway, and roughly another 50 using related campaign hashtags (e.g. #walkawaymovement). the late engagement suggests kremlin-oriented accounts are trailers rather than leaders of the campaign, but the high-level of current engagement indicates an effort to astroturf support for the movement and hijack the narrative. this includes several monitored accounts that have changed their handles to include the hashtag, or that have shared their own supposed walkaway moments. the campaign also received a direct boost from russian propaganda outlets rt and sputnik, both of which ran stories on the movement.](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/)*     keep your eyes out for attempts to divide our movement, and our party, in ways both blatant and subtle.  *we lost the 2016 by 80,000 votes,* less than a football stadium, we can't afford to be at anything less than full strength this year.  a moment's foray into r/walkaway should tell the average user everything they need to know about the movement.  if you see someone using walkaway talking points around social media, take the time to disarm them.  i'm still hearing people talking about the ""rigged primaries,"" a talking point that was [disproven](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/14/16640082/donna-brazile-warren-bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-rigged), so either russia is playing its greatest hits, or people still believe it, or both.    our enemies will be pushing back at us just as hard as they did in 2016, and if they're smart they'll push back *even harder* now that they have an entire political party on their side, but we know what we're looking for, and how to defend against it.  call the bullshit, bullshit, and make sure everybody knows it's bullshit."
759,761,1,"i don't think the point of what the owner of the red hen did was to sway voters.  it was done to show people like sanders, who live in a bubble, that there are people out there who think what they're doing is horrific and that there are consequences to their actions.  they need to know that they're on the wrong side of history."
760,762,1,"i finally just watched [michelle wolf's routine](https://youtu.be/l8iypnnsyjw), and there was maybe one part that was a little too much, but i easily belly-laughed 4 times. very funny delivery! maybe she was too funny? if people can't make fun of themselves then something is very wrong with their self-esteem. i dont even think her best jokes were about huckabee, maybe the softball teams part, but otherwise it was hilarious.

767,769,1,im proud i voted for hillary clinton despite some issues i have with her
768,770,1,"sure but at some point we have to accept the fact that 1/3 of this country *literally believes all sorts of crazy shit about her* and they vote everywhere it's just they are more concentrated in some areas than others. so unless she plans to run again in 2020, i see her and the dnc as a whole being fodder for the kremlinbots and the folks who follow them knowingly or unknowingly. she doesn't have *the it* that bill and barack had. she's smart and she was literally the *best prepared presidential candidate* since george fucking washington and somehow the country elected the other guy. i really do feel bad for her - but it's time to get america back - another two years of republican rule and that supreme court is gone for a generation. think of the regulatory rollbacks, the financial crimes that will become legal, the expansion of citizens united, etc. alec is going to have a field day and eventually 2/3 of the states will come together and try to modify the damned constitution in their *current image* - i mean i don't mean to sound hyperbolic but shit's real.

775,777,1,donald trump is such an terribly written fictional villain. they could have just made him a sketchy billionaire who talks like an idiot. that would be enough. the idiot billionaire who has too much power. thats an ok villain. they didnt have to make him cheat on all three of his wives even while at least one of them was pregnant. and then they made him racist?! why? its too much. he was already really easy to hate. this is insulting. 
776,778,1,"sexism plays a major role in american politics. but, i think that a large part of the reason shes also being held to a higher standard is she was thrust into the spotlight when she defeated a big name in the democratic caucus. almost everyone in the spotlight is going to be disliked by a lot of people.look at obama, or schumer, or even paul ryan or mcturtlesenator. everyone hates all of those guys.

779,781,1,"you claimed she has ""no experience whatsoever"", which is untrue except for ridiculous standards of experience.i think it's fair to say that she is _less_ experienced than other potential candidates. she's certainly less experienced than cuomo, who's had the job for almost eight years. but that's hardly the same thing as no experience; a governor works in advocacy, policy, and management. she's had decades of experience and is well respected in each of those areas. the most relevant attack you can use against her is lack of _breadth_ of experience, rather than depth, because until her candidacy she's been mostly laser focused on education policy. even so, that's true to an extent of any candidate, cuomo included. nobody is an expert in every field."

857,859,1,"yeah, i didn't really pay attention to politics until about halfway through the bush years.  i like bill and i just looked up her record when it became clear she was the likely nominee and came away with ""she's not perfect, and the two have a weird penchant for relatively benign cutting of corners - but, ultimately, they've spent the lat 30 years in public service and have accomplished more than 99.9% of people could ever dream of to help others.""also, i don't really care that she pals around with wealthy people.  she's been in high-level government for 30 years.  you think she's going to hang out at applebee's just to get a sense of average folk?"

887,889,1,"a white mans life is different depending on the city, state and region you live in and economics plays a huge role.  if you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.  i didnt say white men are oppressed and i wont say their privileged either, they live a human life.  the homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him hes privileged and thats why you wont give him any money.even trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  if white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.a year ago i moved from oklahoma to los angeles.  the two cultures are so vastly different.  the democratic party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country thats why we are where we are at.  in oklahoma where i was apart of the democratic party, the hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in oklahoma as sexist and say thats why they wouldnt vote for clinton but at the very same time we had a female republican governor running the state.  texas, kansas, louisiana, arizona and many other red states have had female governors while states like new york and california have not.its not about privilege, race or gender its about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.  sad to say but democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican (trump  is not average).  obama brought people together clinton divided.  we all lost when her campaign started dividing people and it started long before trump got the republican nomination."

""nobody would suggest that the russian intervention was the only factor behind the election outcome, but if you talk to experts like **former fbi agent clint watts, what he will tell you is that if it were not for the russian intervention, donald trump would not have been within even striking distance of hillary clinton.****""i think we have great cause to fear for the security of our elections in 2018 and 2020.** donald trump benefited from the russian intervention in 2016, donald trump probably would not be president if it weren't for the russian intervention in 2016, and he shows very little interest in opposing the russians.""

1042,1044,1,there is a new group but it certainly isn't propping up candidates to the extent you're stating. aoc is the most high profile one but there certainly hasn't been others. all the gains from the democratic party has been from the base. let's not paint a revisionist picture of some kind of revolution from the far left taking over cause that's clearly not happening.and as for your sexist comment... it was sexist. period. using trudeau as a comparison is weak cause you're not in the right sub to make that comment.  and it stands out more when you make vague comments about her qualifications and policies yet make a pointed comment about her looks.

1084,1086,1,forget all the other books. the fact that it's woodward is enough. and he's made it a point not to rely on his reputation - he's provided receipts. this is damning. 
1085,1087,1,i'm really glad that obama and clinton are stepping up their support for the democrats for the upcoming mid terms - the timing is not a coincidence. unfortunately the importance of their participation says a lot about how the direction of the democrats since nov 2016 - they capitulated to internal politics instead of building leadership. 
1086,1088,1,"her campaign in the general didn't advertise in the rust belt until days before she lost to trump. her advertising in the general almost totally ignored policy, and the vast majority of her ads almost exclusively focused on ad-hominem attacks and trumps unfitness for office. which no other political campaign in advertising history has done to the degree her campaign did.trumps campaign, in contrast, stuck to a more traditional advertising strategy of comparing and contrasting policy.citationshttps://www.degruyter.com/view/j/for.2016.14.issue-4/for-2016-0040/for-2016-0040.xml?format=inthttp://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764218756919so considering the vast, vast majority of sanders voters voted for hillary in the general i think i'm gonna have to point more towards a bad general campaign and a historically weird advertising strategy than anything involving sanders as a primary cause of her loss.they should of just stuck with the tried and true method of compare and contrast advertising like she did in the primary against sanders. but instead they gambled on a novel advertising strategy against trump, and lost.i have no idea what they were thinking."

1158,1160,1,"the facts linked here are a bunch of pictures, and people talking about her interactions at intimate venues.  thats exactly my complaint - she focused on small listening sessions where she really got to know people, rather than large rallies that could have connected with more people total.  considering that my area is one of the largest metro regions in the us, she did come here three times, and both bernie and trump had large rallies (trump was a 2 hour drive, bernie 10 minutes away), i do think it was a mistake not to have one herself.  regardless of how she well she did when she had them, the sheer lack of rallies was a problem.  i wanted to see her speak her in person, but i didnt belong to the right circles, so i never got a chance.  thats not good.i think its ok to acknowledge that having small listening sessions may not have been the best strategy for reaching 300 million people."

1170,1172,1,"i didn't say her campaign in the general relied too heavily on the ""old ways"" i said basically the exact opposite.as is outlined in those studies i linked, her campaign used a novel and never before seen advertising strategy in the general that virtually ignored policy based ads and instead focused almost entirely on ad hominem attacks on trump and his fitness for office.it's true that trump isn't fit for office for a lot of reasons, but you should probably also run policy based ads too so people know what you're gonna do as president.all the more so when the media is ignoring the speeches you're giving about policy, and not many people watch the news to begin with.

1184,1186,1,"> (even clinton, had she edged this monster trump only with a slightly different distribution of voters / better roll of the dice, would still be obstructed by this same gop congress and gop state houses, only possibly facing a red wave during midterms right now.) i'll actually disagree here especially in terms of the red wave - yes she might have had the gop congress and senate but we all know she would have veto'd those tax cuts and not even allowed obamacare to be changed. and as for the red wave - i don't think that would have happened because this is where her experience would have come in to play. i love obama but his inexperience resulted in the dems losing the house but clinton as president would have been far more experienced and politically shrewd. she was already anticipating 2018 even during the campaign. she was already advocating for a lot of the candidates who are winning now.>one reason for that is a lot of people have grown disgusted with the limits of the status quo. one party found a way to validate that, the other wasn't in that position.we're not in power because of people being disgusted with status quo. if that was the case the gop wouldn't have won congress and senate in 2016. they kept power on the back of populist rhetoric. there was no validation here.no one stuck their heads in the sand. that's kind of false. democrats didn't pretend that everything was fine. they just engage that narrative on extreme rhetorics with false promises.the only ""elite out-out-touch complacency"" came from trump. i feel like this a huge misrepresentation of what happened and is a result of the dangerous populist politics at play.your message about moderation i agree with completely. but there's no moderate populism. we just have to hope the right kind of candidate replies to it - one who has tangible plans and policies to address populist concerns beyond grandstanding and rhetoric. there's no point in being in power if you can't do anything with that power. if aoc and other populist candidates get elected under trump and a gop government then what's the point of their ideology and rhetoric if they can't make anything happen?

1190,1192,1,its amazing how many people have fallen for the republicans attempt to portray experience as a bad thing.
1191,1193,1,trump is a racist liar and a bigot who hates this country.  he's not even remotely qualified to be president and never should have been inaugurated.
1192,1194,1,"c'mon at some point people should accept that their time to hand over control to the next generation has come. biden and bernie's generation has had control for 30+ years. at some point it's time to make way for a younger generation, less stuck in the old ways.then i'm not even talking about how tone deaf it would be to run another white dude from the stone age in the time of the women's march, the metoo movement, and the resistance."
1193,1195,1,if politicians careers are being destroyed over using a fucking gmail account but trump can defend nazis in charlottesville and grab pussies carte blanche then something is seriously wrong in our country.

1209,1211,1,"comey seems to think that mindlessly following rules, traditions, and norms is necessarily ""non-partisan"" and absolves him of any blame, never stopping to think that many of those same rules, traditions, and norms are *themselves* partisan, and aren't just simply because they're principles. for a guy who calls himself the paragon of impartiality and fairness, he seems very interested in ""perception"" and image and the press reaction and hype and optics--to a fault. i believe he is honest, and that he's telling the truth, but he also comes across as vain and sanctimonious as, say, kanye west....or bernie sanders.

1262,1264,1,"voter turnout is crucial, and there is more to democracy than elections.people are constitutionally empowered to stand up to the people enabling trump, and to make them uncomfortable in public. nobody's saying we should hurt them. i would personally hate to see actual violence befall anyone, whether they serve trump or not.what i am happy to see is that they know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there are a lot of us who think they are absolutely despicable, and that we will refuse to share space with them whenever we can, even if it's a space they want to be in."
1263,1265,1,"we now literally see a coordinated effort by breitbart, drudge and the berniebros to take down joy ann reid.i mean...wtf?dont these idiots see that reid is one of the strongest progressive voices in the media?reid contacted the police months ago because someone hacked her old blog and filled it with homophobic content.the person who discovered this and who contacted her has affirmed that: https://mobile.twitter.com/shoq/status/988422746303496193"

1273,1275,1,"the fact of the matter is. if everyone voted for clinton, we wouldn't be in the mess we are now."
1274,1276,1,there are far more reasons why bernie would have lost. it's naive to think that he would have won in any scenario.
1275,1277,1,"thank you hillary clinton for not going away!we all need that kind of self confidence right now. i posted a few ""weird"" news articles here only to delete them days later due to my own low self confidence. by ""weird"" i mean slightly biased. so say what you want to say...."
1276,1278,1,is he? if so theyll get him eventually.
1277,1279,1,hell yeah brother!
1278,1280,1,"again, you're purposely refusing to see my point. where did i say minimum wage helps white people more? please point that out. i'm clearly saying that bernie approaches it from one angle. he doesn't see that there are nuances affecting economic equality issues that concern race and gender. and to top it all, when he puts economic issues above social and civil rights issues, it's even more alienating to non-white voters. living wage is definitely important but if you're a minority, you're more concerned about getting the job or having the same opportunity for the job as everyone else. bernie's economics don't factor those issues. and if he cared so much about economic equality, then why hasn't he advocated more against voter suppression?he refuses to discuss race and gender in terms of economics when it obviously plays a huge part. that's why his agenda is narrow and wwc specific."
1279,1281,1,"i would never argue she made no mistakes.in fact, i can list a few more.:pnow the question is: can you admit bernie made a huge mistake too?the key moment in 2016 was imo the morning after bernie lost the ca primary.you may remember that rather dramatic moment. the whole press and every politically interested man/ woman was waiting for him to admit defeat, endorse hillary and go to work.not with a huge chip on his shoulder but enthusiastically.he didnt.instead he spoke about how he'd still win, and launched a huge attack on both hillary and the dnc.he continued that for 5 full weeks afterwards.those 5 weeks are key. they gave us a time period in which bernie and trump double teamed in their attacks on hillary.he created an illusion among his followers he could still win the primaries (which he couldnt) making their disappointment bigger and bigger.and then we saw the melodrama at the convention where bernies supporters (not all but a lot) behaved like complete and total scum.booing john lewis? booing the mothers of the movement?booing any poc they could?sitting there with their mouths taped and playing the spoiled disgusting drama queens they were?the months afterwards, i made the silly decision to start working for our revolution as a kind of peace offering. i worked on the campaigns of jayapal and teachout.not a single fucking berner wanted to work on those campaigns, instead they obsessed over wikileaks and their immature hatred of the woman that won and the dem party.on the day before the election i wrote a deeply felt passionate plea to the bernie subs here on reddit begging them to vote for hillary.if not for themselves, for minorities, for women, children, muslims, poc, lgtb.i warned them how much trump would hurt us.i was laughed at, yelled at, scorned and ridiculed by the entitled, privileged scumbags who call themselves bernieorbusters.and now, we see everything happen that hillary and we warned for.women, poc, lgtb, children are hurting. and you or any other bernie supporter who voted for hillary are ok, but do not question that :yes bernie did enormous damage to hillary's campaign.he should have campaigned for her from the ca primary on. should not have taken a leave to write his damn book and most of all: he should have addressed his spoiled privileged supporters not once but over and over again to talk some sense into them about wikileaks, russian meddling (bots promoting bernie) and so on and on.and jane sanders should go to hell for her tweet when bernie endorsed hillary and told his supporters to vote for her, they shouldnt always follow/ do what bernie told them to."
1280,1282,1,"yeah, ive addressed that."
1281,1283,1,"idk about that. gore was and still is staunchly against fossil fuels, and he would have had absolutely no qualms about pissing off middle eastern (sa & opec) countries by killing obl whenever wherever. heck, he probably would have enjoyed it."
1282,1284,1,"its sad that you you look at race and gender before you have empathy for human suffering.  a homeless white man is not living in any sense of privilege, period.  when you hit the bottom you hit the bottom.your logic is flawed.  you dont have to do or say something for another human to say or do something racist or sexist to you.  racism and sexism is prejudice, meaning to judge a priori.  if we were to use your logic a person could say african americans must have done something to get shot by police over and over again police just dont shoot if theres not a good reason. or someone must have done something horrible for white nationalists to protest in charlottesville.please dont make any assumptions about the way i vote either, i know you werent in the voting booth with me.  if you have to shame people to vote for your candidates then your candidates are not worth being on the ballot.what did i post here thats racist or sexist? is that really where you are taking this now. "
1283,1285,1,"i'm sorry where did you see me say it was a ""peaceful revolution""? wow, way to try and deflect by literally making up stuff. also, it's clear you have no understanding about the arab spring."
1284,1286,1,"well, it looks bernie as an independent has a bigger role in the democratic party than hillary. don't you hear the calls for her to go knitting?"
1285,1287,1,"i love them both so much. i posted a rbg quote about the supreme court and for the few that were in the smaller sub (not r/wayofthebern btw) and it was not a warm reception, it was the first time ive experienced it from that angle honestly, given my experience. they were averse to it on the ground of blah blah identity politics is bad - and i dont disagree that bickering to no end is bad, like lets focus on goals, but im also a gay dude and an ally to women, and believing rape victims or properly revering them anyway, is not identity politics! i was disappointed. so im catwoman. but elizabeth is all about holding the banks accountable too. its about all of the above, and im so definitely about her!"
1286,1288,1,bad bot
1287,1289,1,"you have to do what you feel best. for me i aint fuckin leaving. this is my country. theres more people in this country who know what true american ideals are, than there are who blindly support trump and whatever lies he is spewing. i dont blame you for wanting to leave at all. ive thought about it. but i still believe in us, usa"
1288,1290,1,the party of facts!
1289,1291,1,theres that video of him saying creepy things to teenage daughters of congress-people getting their pictures taken. i might have previously dismissed that as old awkward man being old and awkward but in light of all that weve seen in the last few years it pulls at my stomach. shame really because i think hes a very effective communicator and popular in eastern pa which is important. 
1290,1292,1,betsy devos is fond of charter schools as well.
1291,1293,1,">""i'm a nazi because hillary called me 'deplorable"".correct me if i'm wrong, but i think she was referring to actual nazis there.  when she made that comment, i gained a lot of respect for hillary."
1292,1294,1,"agreed on both sides. we had bush, clinton, bush, clinton (running and lost), obama (obviously beat clinton), then we had both clinton and bush running (both lost) and ended up with trump. america isn't huge on long term dynasties but the bush and clinton family sure did give it a run. for 20 years we saw 1 of 2 names lead the country and then they still ran and personally i am glad both lost. i'd be happy if neither a bush or a clinton won another presidency.

1297,1299,1,february 
1298,1300,1,i just have so little faith in the gop to actually do anything more than express faux outrage. hopefully we have our people go and vote. that seems like the only real option left.
1299,1301,1,"what i hate the most is how many ""progressives"" bought every bit of that smear campaign.there could also be an entire book written about the sexism she faced during the campaign."
1300,1302,1,"> how is it anti bernie?bernies army in disarray. if this has nothing to do with hillary, why is it on this subreddit? again, i voted for hillary - twice. "
1301,1303,1,"what even is ""too far left?"" nobody is campaigning for equal wages across the board or putting all jobs in the public sector. no progressive is campaigning to ban free speech, overturn the 2nd amendment or anything of that matter.  of course, fox news makes it seem that way, but this is all for dividing the democratic party to ensure that the gop always wins."
1302,1304,1,same here.the gop has turned itself in a party of racists and traitors.its trump's party now selling american interests to the highest bidder.
1303,1305,1,"ugh. looking back on 2016 knowing what i know now....  i have several friends who voted for jill stein insisting they weren't throwing away their vote, basically parroting those russian fb pages.  now, it's almost impossible to get them to admit they were duped.  even after cnn published all those fb groups that were outed as fake, and they know they followed those pages! all those memes they shared with blatantly false statements about hillary's platform...   conservatives are taking alot of shit for falling for the fake russian nonsense, but liberals were just as susceptible.  it sucks because no one wants to admit they got fooled."

1311,1313,1,i really liked the things she had to say.
1312,1314,1,"a typical liberal mistake it to bash hillary that dems can start being civil after the election again. of course she    didn't imply violence, but telling the republicans the truth without mincing words."
1313,1315,1,"wow grandpa bernie name calling and everything, thanks for proving me right"
1314,1316,1,"the republicons played the refs. not just the fbi, but also the press and a whole host of other organizations as well."
1315,1317,1,why are you taking offence? have i insulted you? you've stated some categorically false things. i've questioned you on it. if you take it personally then maybe you shouldn't state it.instead of answering my points you're feeling aggrieved. that's no discussion.i can look up nita lowey but honestly if you have a point about her then state it. 
1316,1318,1,they are useful idiots. they push voter apathy and hide it behind their pseudo intellectualism. they defend trump's fascism from the left in order to make everything about hillary clinton. i wonder how many of them are actually trump backers and how many are just too dumb to realize that they are doing his work
1317,1319,1,"what if it's true? what if she was so greedy that she sold access to her server to foreign entities? i have liked the clintons for a long time, but i cannot think of too many non-nefarious reasons that she would use her own private server? maybe she just wanted to get what this country truly owed her and her family?"
1318,1320,1,except the bodies ended up being mundane piles of normal work paper the russians illegally coordinated making a big deal about with the trump campaign. 
1319,1321,1,"yeah very unfortunate. and we all know that. and that's not what the op is about clearly. its about the popular vote. no one is disputing trump  the ""election"". more people voted for hillary and even more would vote for her now. that's a majority either ways."
1320,1322,1,so don't run bernie sanders. got it.  glad we settled that.

1454,1456,1,"my career's in tech infrastructure and security (more infra than security, but i'm not ignorant), so that's where my perspective is focused here.would there be direct evidence?  in a well-run setup, possibly. depends on how good the hackers were.in almost any of these setups?  fuck no.  all the circumstantial evidence others are complaining about is *probably* the best the public's gonna get.  i can't speak to legal status, but in the tech world, the evidence michael harriot laid out in this piece is more than enough to answer the kinds of questions we tend to have.  those questions boil down to essentially one:given the available metadata (logs, audit trails, system monitoring histograms, diffs between backups and live data, etc), *can we trust that this system wasn't tampered with*?that question itself is generally made up of two smaller ones:  what *do* we know? and what *can* we know?  i almost started basically typing out the article in my own words, but i'll skip that part.  between how badly-secured these systems were (both design and implementation, and all the way from end-user to database backends), how badly audited and logged they were, and how badly backups were kept (if any), i think most competent professionals would generally agree on these points:* we know attackers gained access to live voting systems/databases* we know end-user voting machines are embarrassingly easy to gain access to.* due to bad security practices of many kinds, and in at least one case deliberate deletion of backups, *it is not possible* to verify whether or not data was changed in many of these cases.in the computer security world, if you can't verify something, being thorough means you must assume the worst-case scenario.  how you deal with it depends a lot on context but to stay focused: this means that we as technical professionals *must* assume rolls and votes were tampered with.the malfeasance and incompetence continually demonstrated over the course of the last two decades or so of modern electronic voting in the us has the general public in a position where anyone with a strong enough political lean can accept or dismiss the available data as they wish.  the pattern-matcher in me wants to think that's on purpose but that's neither here nor there.as an industry expert, the 'case' presented in this article is highly convincing.  ""can we trust that these systems were not tampered with?""  no, full stop.  will we ever have *direct* evidence that votes were changed? given the mismanagement involved, i very strongly doubt that.  is that enough for a legal case? i have no idea. if i were brought in to fix the situation? this is more than enough."

1578,1580,1,"> who i have since cut ties withthere's been a lot of that.  trump really fucked with the fabric of our nation.  my grandmother had been going to the same church for twenty years, after the election her ministers sent a letter to the whole congregation discussing how elated they were to finally have a christian (pence) in the white house. that same day my grandmother wrote a letter back, outlining the importance of the word of christ, the 10 commandments, and how little her ministers knew about what it means to be christian.    i'm pretty sure they got a lot of letters like that, because she got another letter next week, begging her and everyone else to come back.    i hate that people are losing loved ones over politics, but how can i be friends with someone who voted for a pussy grabbing rapist that wants to bomb children?  i *don't want* to know that person."
1579,1581,1,"eh, i think it's a smart move. if events unfold such that she is the best bet to get a democrat in office in 2020 she should run. i don't think that scenario is that likely, but she may as well leave the door slightly ajar."
1580,1582,1,how do you feel about the masses of people who sat out the election? is that clinton's fault? 
1581,1583,1,don't equate bernie to the left when he's dismissing identity politics as a non issue. cortes does not. she embraces identity politics. bernie only cares about wwc so he's not a progressive.

1592,1594,1,happy friday everybody
1593,1595,1,right. my fear would have been that the republicans elected someone as corrupt or more corrupt than trump in 2020 but much more competent.
1594,1596,1,umm what?

1598,1600,1,"well, i think most of us already knew this..."
1599,1601,1,speaking out against putin and his destruction of democracy doesn't make nance or anyone part of any 'pro war propaganda machine'. ironic since your comment comes off as brainwashed propaganda. if anything greenwald is the one proving to be a cog in putin's pro war propaganda by sticking up for an authoritarian who has no regard for the rights of his own citizens and props up dictators and corrupt oligarchs globally. 
1600,1602,1,that's utterly ridiculous 
1601,1603,1,gay marriage was still a pretty hot button issue nationally when obama came out in favor of it. support nationally at the time was 51-54% thats barely half. legal weed support is 60% nationally and was passed by more then 60% in california. that was such an easy issue to come out in favor of! obama had to represent the entire nation feinstein has to only represent california! the most liberal state in the nation. my issue is with old people who stay stagnant with their political views! thats my issue. if your going to be in power for several terms im not just going to support you when your late to evolving with the current issues till the last moment. obama also chose by himself to evolve if feinstine opponent hadnt been farther the the left i doubt she would have changed her views on things!
1602,1604,1,"there are more dems than gop, and the dems want him out, they are super-energized.  we'll find a candidate, there will be 50 to choose from."
1603,1605,1,"wow, thank you for displaying a perfect example of ""tone deaf"". always educational,"
1604,1606,1,"he isnt the most popular senator in a national poll, is he?oh and seriously? you think underwood, lucy mcbath, sharice davids, gina ortez to just name a few, ran on sanders-esque platforms?how can you not see how you a: belittle what they accomplished by attributing what they did to sanders, b: completely misrepresent their positions. sanders actively ran against davids, to name just one example. wanted to push the white out of state guy instead of her, so lets not pretend theyre connected to sanders, shall we?no, they had nothing to do with sanders or his platform. lucy mcbath ran because of her son being murdered and because she wants to fight for gun control (against which bernie voted repeatedly).policies matters, sure, but so does skin color. representation matters.this isnt the moment to run a 80 year old white guy. that applies to sanders but also to biden.you may see that as bias, but there is no way inm hell i'm gonna end up voting for a 80 year old white guy in the coming primaries, in the time of 'me too' and raging white nationalism."

1668,1670,1,"if the results tonight are the same as 2016, this country deserves anything and everything it gets. i cannot imagine what more needs to be said and done to get people to vote. if they don't want to vote, then fuck them. let the gop fuck this country over, it's poetic justice at that point."
1669,1671,1,mundane or opinions. not even a whole lot of sausage making to question. there was more juicy info from manaforts daughters texts posted last week.
1670,1672,1,"so, why are you in this subreddit?"
1671,1673,1,"they only knew because he had over the top, unrealistic things to say and drew in purists who didn't do their research but liked what he had to say.  people like you.  no way would moderates have voted for him, and if people did their research, they'd know there's no way any of those proposals would get through congress.  i think the only person in the world i hate more than i hate bernie is trump and there's nothing i'd love more than to see him lose his senate seat.  and i'm sorry, but the democratic nomination should go to a democrat.  bernie trying to get the democratic nomination would be like someone from harvard trying to run for a student government position at yale."

1759,1761,1,"ive always found some solace in the fact that history will remember clinton better for not having won.in fact, people will one day look back on her with the admiration that i do now."
1760,1762,1,hopefully 
1761,1763,1,"amen.btw: the one thing why i will support ocasio-cortez is that when asked, she said with no hesitation: i am a proud democrat.if you cant say that, you have no business running in a dem primary."
1762,1764,1,"you misunderstood my post completely.i deeply despise bernie exactly for this reason: when a dem wins the primary: you support that dem, period!in other words: i support ocasio-cortez and ridicule the assumption in the press that dems will lose the midterms because a socialist is running in a deep blue district.and if you really dont know why people hate bernie after all the shit that happened in 2016, you havent been paying much attention..."
1763,1765,1,but why shouldn't she act that way since she's earned it?
1764,1766,1,"it was reported in the post, vanity fair, the book *shattered*... don't have the time to google all the links now, but it was widely reported biden tried to enter the race and obama's people don't him, ""nuh uh"".i'd rather have had as many choices as the republicans had for the open seat, and with more than one of them with a little establishment backing."
1765,1767,1,hopefully one day it can be 50/50.
1766,1768,1,i finally actually agree with her. she is exactly right. democrats need to stop being civil and point out that one side is virtually a hate group at this point. it appears she has learned her lesson from the election after all. 
1767,1769,1,this is a strange hit piece coming from the respected nytimes paper. trump has always been a big fan.

1769,1771,1,i've always considered it suspicious that the projections were off just exactly enough to secure narrow victories in a few key states.  and we know for a fact that the russians looked into hacking the editorial systems themselves.  these don't seem like a coincidence.
1770,1772,1,the arizona special election for the 8th is on today. this is a trump +20 district but polling has it really close. go vote of you can. the rest of us will watch and see just how blue this district shifts.
1771,1773,1,">  almost all of which was based on her policies, decisions, and donors.um, again, please don't be revisionist here. his only attack against her was about the speeches and he painted her as corrupt for the speeches without any evidence. not once did he actually question her policies in any meaningful way. that's why he lost the debates. you're trying to paint a very revisionist picture of the primaries. please provide evidence.>how dare he question she who felt entitled to the nomination!and there you go, proving my point. it's only bernie and his supporters who think she was entitled. no one else did because she was actually qualified. when you twist someone's qualifications and experience as ""being entitled"" then there's a definite prejudice there."
1772,1774,1,"please no. look, i'm a fan of hillary, but she already lost to trump once. we need somebody else, like elizabeth warren, kamela harris, or bernie."
1773,1775,1,"aoc is a woman spewing fact-free bs.  men can do that on the national stage without being called on it.  women can't.&#x200b;this is one of the situations where the correct answer isn't to treat the women like the men but rather the other way around.  nobody should be able to pull numbers out of their butts on the national stage without being called on it.  the problem isn't that aoc is being asked hard questions to back up her slogans, the problem is that bernie wasn't asked those questions."

1775,1777,1,"probably at obama's orders after he spewed that ""no serious person thinks..."" lie.  he didn't want her to be allowed to be president."
1776,1778,1,"bernie would have lost every state that hillary lost plus virginia and nevada.just look at his tax plan and how much he wanted to gouge middle class americans while lying and saying the ""one tenth of one percent"" would be paying for his programs. as soon as gop pointed that out he'd be dead.kasich said during one of the debates that anyone on that stage would win all 50 states against sanders."
1777,1779,1,"you dont owe anyone on reddit anything. but this kind of attitude is a big part of why we lost. youve implied im a bernie bro to demean me, even though i voted for clinton.her 2016 campaign was lacking in olive branches. it was described as divisive, which unfortunately seems to be going strong in 2018. hopefully the 2020 democratic campaign will be better. "
1778,1780,1,seeing trump and putin on tv together at those podiums is making my stomach hurt.
1779,1781,1,thats how spoilers work. i think he would be a good spoiler. i dont *like* him lol. 
1780,1782,1,"not surprised that this is being downvoted considering the amount of bernie bro brigading this sub experiences. it's not surprising he's casting doubts over a blue wave - bernie has done nothing but attack democrats since 2016 and before. he's spent more time tearing down democrats and the party instead of trump and the republicans. it's not a surprise. as always, he's stepping in at the last moment. typical bernie behavior."
1781,1783,1,i wish she could run again im a former republican and i would vote for her again
1782,1784,1,"i feel like we need someone well known enough that people know who they are, but someone who's kept a low profile enough that they don't have baggage.  it seems like to be elected, a liberal can't have baggage, whereas all a conservative has to do is be religious, pro-guns and anti-abortion.  obama and hillary had very similar views, yet he won without much trouble and she lost to a living piece of trash.  john kerry was arguably more qualified than gwb, but also lost because the republicans dissected him.  gore was attacked for being ""boring."""
1783,1785,1,he's a bad guy right? 
1784,1786,1,"how about you give me a break. she literally won the popular vote by millions and since there's been many questions raised about russia's role in the electoral college outcome.if she runs again, it will happen. a large enough segment of the country hates any powerful dem with every fibre of their being. anyone winning that nomination for 2020 on the dem side will get the hate treatment and the 'it's cool to hate them' bot army against them on the internet."
1785,1787,1,politicians like trump.
1786,1788,1,"bernie sanders strongly condems the fact sarah sanders was asked to leave a restaurant....some revolutionary that fraud is.then he adds: i'm not a great fan of shouting down people or being rude to people.hello?that's all your supporters ever did to us, minorities, women, lgtb, didnt bother you then, did it???https://mobile.twitter.com/shannonrwatts/status/1012062204533751808"
1787,1789,1,until today.
1788,1790,1,first of all i want to make it clear. i was nd am super into hillary. i gave her more money than ive ever given a candidate. i made hundreds of phone calls for her. im not into bernie.cuomo has been fucking over nyc big time. hes also complicit with the big democratic machine thats making state government horrible. a lot of my pro hillary friends havent liked cuomo for years and support nixon. maybe more people from new york should chime in. on my facebook feed theres a lot of excitement around nixon and not a single positive mention of cuomo.

"
1801,1803,1,"cool... so pointing out the age of a reddit account - that's all you've got? a one day old account could have pointed out your transparent bullshit. that's not going to hide your misogyny.

1802,1804,1,"tbh ""crash"" is a pretty dramatic way to describe hitting a concrete pillar inside a parking garage. "
1803,1805,1,the difference between medvedevs russia and putons russia is constantly understated on reddit. medvedev was far more western friendly and worked on nuclear disarmament treaties. the same ones putin is trying to get rid of. putin maintained some degree of power during that time but analysis shows that medvedev had a different approach than putin which he was capable of implementing.

1807,1809,1,"which absolute claims? i have in fact made no claims whatsoever about nys politics, except pointing out nixon is inexperienced.you're losing the debate and decide to throw around insults instead.anyway: take your lame bro behavior elsewhere."
1808,1810,1,">michael schmidt, we should recall and as i recount in my book (pp. 105113 in the paperback) was the reporter who wrote the misleading (and quietly retracted) initial stories about hillary clintons emails that launched the scandaland he was at the head of the media juggernaut that kept it running throughout the campaign. now, hes nabbed a new headline based on what may well have been a sardonic joke made by rosenstein about recording trump. the notes were fragmentary, the tone was unclear andmost significantly never resulted in action of any sort.>the new york times already has hillary clintons blood on their hands. if rosenstein is fired and trump gets away with it as non-obstructive, they can add that to their record of irresponsible journalism. not fake news. just irresponsible journalism."
1809,1811,1,because she is a strong experienced leader and trumpitler is an overweight old child who could never have succeeded if russia hadn't hacked the election for him. 
1810,1812,1,that asswipe will never be my president.

1815,1817,1,"awesome!!!""the point being, im so happy youre not being silent. but i want you to talk, if you could, about that decision not to be silent. and also, how are you dealing with the constant barrage of attempts to silence you?hillary clintoni found this also very curious. because to the best of my memory, no man who ever lost a presidential election was ever told to shut up and go away. and im glad they werent, because each had points of view and experiences that were worth hearing about.ive given a lot of thought to this, and i do conclude  and i write about it in my book  that there is this long, long history of trying to silence women. literally in literature, in the western canon, it goes back to the odyssey.penelope is holding the whole country together while odysseus is taking his time getting back. shes raising their son, telemachus.theres a very telling scene where all the usual partiers and others are hanging around, hoping that shell finally decide that her husbands dead and marry one of them so that they can take over. telemachus is now about 17, so hes a young man.his mother comes down, as she always did, to greet people and listen to their complaints and to continue being the glue that held the country together. and her son greets her by saying, mother, go back upstairs. speech is not for women.the really terrific classics professor mary beard  who some of you know, and if you dont, look her up  has just written a book about women and power, in which she traces this whole line of being quiet: dont speak. dont speak up.now, for everyone saying, well, thats a hillary clinton problem. the people who theyd interview, saying, well, of course i would vote for a woman! just not that woman. in the last year and a half, what have we seen?"""
1816,1818,1,"""like some meme on instagram.""  perfect.  as a millennial, i'm often bothered by the articles blaming my generation for everything, but my generation needs to realize life isn't one big meme.  stop normalizing trump by making everything into a meme.  this isn't a joke.  this is real, this happening, and so much is at stake.  and so many people in my age group just don't care."
1817,1819,1,no shit.

1830,1832,1,how stupid to lie again about this when pictures prove you wrong!
1831,1833,1,i'm not going to get back into arguments from the 2016 primary but you asked why people are still upset and i told you. if you don't see what they see then fine let's just leave it there.in regard to your second point: no. congress will not be fixing this. we are talking about the way the supreme court interprets the constitution. you can change that by changing the supreme court via presidential appointments or through constitutional amendment. if you're banking on an amendment to preserve the civil liberties that have been jeopardized by this presidency then you're a fool.this is a disaster that is going to take generations to undo. we are set back generations. i like ocasio-cortez. i really like her and am very happy to see her win that district. i want more people like her in congress. but that one seat is a drop in the bucket compared to what we are facing. it is not a solution or even a ray of hope.
1832,1834,1,"it was nice to see obama stepping up more to criticize trump. i know that there is an unspoken rule that past presidents shouldn't be too involved, but this is not a normal time.the unsuccessful candidate also usually isn't too involved, but this is again different. it is great to see hillary stepping up her profile, not just to discuss her own mistakes but to directly criticize america's biggest mistake, donald trump.maybe she will run in 2020 and maybe she won't, but either way we need her voice."
1833,1835,1,because the left only care about people who satisfy their purity tests... they don't care about democracy or actual progressive movements. democrats are in danger of capitulating to the fringe like the gop did.

1983,1985,1,"that is the best way to make sure republicans win. look, for whatever reason, they've been able to make her the boogie man. they've successfully run against her for 20 years. (they've had power consistently with the exception of the financial crisis which swung the power for a very short time.)  every single candidate of theirs they convince voters is running against hillary. it is literally their playbook. to the point that currently, every republican campaign and conservative superpac feature her. i am not saying it is fair, it isn't. she needs to quiet down and run things like palpatine, quietly in the back where the public doesn't see or hear from her. if she stays in the spotlight, the conservatives stay in power. "
1984,1986,1,"clearly not, but it is a politician's job. you see racists and i see failed human potential, you seem angry but you should really be saddened. hate doesn't beat hate, only love can do that. you can stay angry, talking about how horrible ""the other"" is in your little hillary bubble if you want, but why...?"

2009,2011,1,we were eight years in power by ta-nehisi coates.i found it the most interesting explanation so far of 2016.

2011,2013,1,"imo, hillary can do whatever the fuck she wants. no one in the media is telling bernie, biden, romney and/or kerry not to run, but everyone is telling hillary to take a seat and keep quiet. she got the 2nd most votes in the history of our country, and the presidency was stolen from her, so if she wants to take another shot, good for her. let the voters decide if they want to nominate her again, and not a bunch of pundits on tv.

2012,2014,1,"can i ask you a serious question:at this point, judging from your post history, we all know you are a troll. and frankly, i'm not even mad at this point. i'm just curious about what is this about trolling that is so rewarding to you? does being a sexist, homophobic immature twat on social media makes ppl like you more in real life? seriously, have you ever stopped and questioning: it's time for me to grow the fuck up and be a better person?"

2016,2018,1,i'm really glad that obama and clinton are stepping up their support for the democrats for the upcoming mid terms - the timing is not a coincidence. unfortunately the importance of their participation says a lot about how the direction of the democrats since nov 2016 - they capitulated to internal politics instead of building leadership.

"
2081,2083,1,"i watched the entire show. she never ceases to amaze me. hillary has more intelligence and compassion in her pinky finger than the current occupant in the wh. but what struck me most in the interview is how she fiercely she defended the fbi and the press considering how they burned her alive during the campaign season. comey, the new york times, chuck  todd, andrea mitchell and chris cillizza could not find a better defender than hillary.

2098,2100,1,"the anti-abortion crowd really bothers me, especially since i've had abortions.  they talk about being pro-life, but they completely disregard existing life.  if a woman doesn't want to go through a pregnancy and have something in her body that she doesn't want there, she shouldn't have to.  and if a woman doesn't want to parent, then that would be unfair to everyone involved.  if i got pregnant again, an abortion would be the only option. i'm in my 20s, in school full time, working 30 hours a week, making less than 20k a year and unmarried. additionally, i know that i'm not prepared emotionally to raise a child. i know some people talk about adoption, but it would absolutely kill me for the baby that i carried to be considering another woman his or her mother. some young women talk about how they keep their babies because they love them too much to give them up, but the fact is, loving the baby isn't enough. love isn't going to provide food or shelter or insurance, money will do that, and i barely have enough to support myself, let alone a child. even birth control isn't 100% effective.and lastly - i can't help but notice that so many of these anti-abortion people are men. men who have no chance of ever getting pregnant and don't have a bunch of old guys telling them what to do with their bodies."

2147,2149,1,"and here you are holding her to higher standards.*i think people need to remember she is very early on in her political career. if more young people became active like her and began to learn, this country would be a much better place. i personally am looking forward to the road ahead of her. *edit: i mentioned the president as a comparison that i guess didnt come out as intended. either way, my comment still stands. if she were a man she wouldnt be expected to be any less ignorant than she is being perceived as. i think she has some great ideas and im excited to see how she works at executing them throughout her career which is still very early on. people keep latching onto her as some kind of icon or representation of the progressive grassroots movement. but she is only one person and she is not perfect. she did not ask to be in the spotlight, shes just trying to make a difference as we all should try to do. "
2148,2150,1,yep. considering she won all the firewall primaries and was never in danger of losing the huge states. some email backbiting and debate scheduling would not have made sanders the nominee. 
2149,2151,1,"> anyway my comments aren't her campaign... where exactly in her campaign did these sentiments pop up?the actions of hillary supporters reflect her campaign, just like the actions of trump supporters reflect his. > neither did obama. neither did bernie. it was the political climate of the time.i did. how did i manage that? > and what does her husband's strategy have to do with her? her campaign included good things she did as first lady. if you read articles from the 1990s, they all call her the most politically-involved first lady ever. many articles are mad about this, saying that its an unconstitutional expansion of the executive branch. she could show up at an event and it was like the president had shown up - like there were two presidents. her time as first lady then launched the rest of her political career. her husband campaigned for her, and her campaigns followed the clintonism script quite exactly. if the accomplishments of the white house when she was first lady count, so do the failings. > again, it's pretty clear you didn't vote for her. why are you going out of your way to make it seem like that?i dont know what to tell you, man. i dont really care if you dont believe me. ive used a straight party ticket every election since i was 18. im a single-issue voter on abortion. who else would i vote for?"

2158,2160,1,"i worked for hillary in 2016. the problem wasn't just the far left, it was a lack of energy for her supporters as well. i never had as hard of a time getting volunteers as i did for hillary, even her biggest supporters were so burnt out by the end of the elections that i couldn't squeeze more than one knocking shift out of them.  don't get me wrong, maybe she could've won if the far left came in from the cold, but the fact is that many other candidates would've won handily because of how they motivated their base. this last election shouldn't have been an issue, democrats should've won the presidency easily.

2159,2161,1,watching his behavior in the primaries and reading his disastrous interview in the ny daily news completely turned me against him. he really has no clue how to actually solve problems.

2163,2165,1,> worrying overmuch about policy detail is actually sort of useless until that situation is on the horizon.actually worrying about policy detail is anything but useless and this where the problem lies at the moment.populist politics is extremely dangerous - we're seeing it with trump right now. we've seen it with the germans pre-wwii when their brand of populism failed and allowed extremists to take over. that's what is happening now.populism is dangerous whether its from the left or the right. there's no point in electing candidates on the basis of their rhetoric if they can't deliver once in office. populism feeds the masses without actually providing actual solutions. it's a power play tactic. if the voting public actually care about how laws are changed then they should care enough not to vote on rhetoric alone because we all know that fizzles out eventually. policy detail is exactly the thing we need to be thinking about in progressive candidates. for far too long we've had so called progressive candidates who have been elected on their rhetoric and then have failed to deliver once in office. you call it the establishment but they did exactly what people like aco are doing now to get elected.they use populist rhetoric to get elected and then stay in office for years without doing anything. this is exactly the thing we should be fighting against.i like her message. i want that message from a younger politician but i don't want it from someone who has no track record or experience of getting shit done.

2207,2209,1,my educated guess is they exclude liberal voices because that is what their donors want. makes it easier for them to get the legislation hand-crafted for themselves. they pay people to come up with the plans for that exclusion. it's not like all of the gerrymandering that went on in 2011 was the result of the legislators thinking up those things themselves. the big money in this country pays people to do that kind of work and then the gop just makes it official.

2243,2245,1,"hillary delivered some pretty critical commentary towards the administration lately and she might be anticipating that her own security clearance will be revoked as a consequence, like former cia director (and frequent trump critic) john brennan's was. when that happened, it dominated the news cycle for awhile. plus, the president revoking security clearances because he disagrees with them politically is not something that was done before trump.my interpretation of this is that hillary would rather voluntarily give up her security clearance rather than having it *revoked* because 1) revocation would create a bigger news story, the press would rehash 2016, and more important issues would be ignored and 2) she doesn't want to take part in establishing this new precedent of the president revoking security clearances for people he doesn't like. she wants to limit the ability of trump to politicize the security clearance process."

2625,2628,0,even the people that are aware the girl scouts aren't affiliated would rather send their kids to bsa. it's hard to find anybody saying anything good about the girl scouts. as a former boy scout with two daughters i'm totally fine with the boy scouts running the whole scouting show. i actually think that they will segregate the boys and girls again once the girl scouts are put out of business. you will end up with mixed cub scouts then girl scouts separate from boy scouts underneath of the bsa umbrella. basically bsa is going to swallow up and rebrand the girl scouts minus the cookies. that's the number one complaint i saw on reddit was parents loving the experience their boys got at scouts but not liking the experience their daughters get in the girl scouts. from what i understand the girl scouts were given the opportunity to merge with bsa in the past but wanted to stay separate because of the cookie sales. girl scouts got their priorities fucked up and it's costing them.

(also related: in a case of an auto accident/etc where a pregnant woman and/or her unborn infant is killed, the perp can be charged with the death of that pre-born infant. it is not seen as a ""clump of cells"" by the court system, it is seen as a pre-born infant person thus its death/injury results in legal charges. i find it very strange that the very same court system flip-flops around and sees a viable fetus either as a ""victim"" or as a ""clump of cells"" based on the mother's attitude toward the pre-born infant, in terms of her desire to keep or discard it.)"

(how benevolent) flooding europe with africans and muslims= white iq too high, wont put up with low wages and living in shitty ghettos, and receiving social benefits instead of proudly working for a living. this will sound bad, but it isnt my opinion its theirs. they call this the [ kalergi plan ] and i urge you to google it. they feel that they must force race mixing, diversity, and tolerance in homogeneous nations that dislike migrants.

(i finally wrote one) i remember crying ,i told him i wouldnt write anything. he squeezed my arms, and told me to start writing and he would let go. no one called my mom, or anything. i got a lawyer he called the sherif and i never heard from him again.i was only 12 years old. our mayors and officials were jokes.
