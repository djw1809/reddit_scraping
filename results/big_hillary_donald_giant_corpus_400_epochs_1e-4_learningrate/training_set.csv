37,38,1,"not every trump supporter wears white robes or a hood, but all of them decided that, and all the horrible things trump does, isn't a deal breaker or that they hate liberals or corporations and the establishment too much to really stand against that.  and that isn't okay with me.  i cut my friends who didn't vote for hillary off and have no regrets."
38,39,1,"comey is no hero, he's foremost self serving. trump just happened to bruise his ego and now he's after trump. "

52,53,1,yes queen!
53,54,1,"thank you, and exactly. people don't realise there is a lot of historical precedence for this. -andrew jackson won the 1824 popular vote but lost the election, then came back and won four years later in 1828.-grover cleveland won the 1888 popular vote but lost the election, then came back and won four years later in 1892.-richard nixon barely lost the presidential election of 1960, then decided to run for president again and won in 1968.so not only is there precedence for a candidate who won the popular vote running again and winning, but there's also precedence for someone who already ran for president and lost running again and winning.and in fact, *every* person who won the popular vote for president and lost the election who then ran again *all* won the next time. of presidential candidates who won the popular vote but weren't elected president, there are only those who won on their next run (jackson, cleveland) and those who just didn't run again (samuel tilden, al gore) who nevertheless would've had strong cases if they'd wanted to run again."
54,55,1,your answer was more kind than mine. 
55,56,1,yes! she is on point here about identity politics. perfectly said. i really really do hope that the democrats start recognizing her worth leading in to 2020.

63,64,1,the difference between medvedevs russia and putons russia is constantly understated on reddit. medvedev was far more western friendly and worked on nuclear disarmament treaties. the same ones putin is trying to get rid of. putin maintained some degree of power during that time but analysis shows that medvedev had a different approach than putin which he was capable of implementing.

119,120,1,"my main issue is there doesn't seem to be respect for other opinions or an understanding of where they come from, and i mean that in a very broad sense. i randomly checked in here, don't think i've been here since 2016, and i was surprised by the tweet. i didn't think hillary was still active politically and i didn't know this sub was active either. this post reached r/all, and i saw a comment that was basically the same reaction i had to seeing it. then i saw it was getting downvoted, and the user i've been going back and forth with was being very personal and hostile toward that person. it reminded me of the general feeling i've always had when i come here. i unsubbed a long time ago because the culture here is actually kind of toxic. so i said something along those lines. i notice the same things in r/politics. so many conservatives have liberal stances when you question them in a way that doesn't trigger them. so many of them are looking for the door. but they feel unwelcome by liberals, because there is an endless stream of shaming and ridicule toward them. this approach will never persuade anyone. it drives people to entrench themselves. if you want people to join you, you have to respect where they currently are and seek common ground and common goals, then maybe if you're lucky the differences will become common ground too. for such a prominent political figure it's always struck me as bizarre how exclusive and hostile her subreddit is. liberals seem so convinced that they have the moral and intellectual high ground that they're oblivious to how they are perceived and how much they alienate potential allies. i don't care about mean comments from internet strangers. it was annoying for maybe a few minutes. i care about unifying the lower and middle classes. projection and lack of mutual respect is a pervasive issue and a major obstacle to that. i commented because of the condescending hostility i saw toward another user for having the wrong reaction to the post. this sub and this public figure got some rare visibility on this site and screwed it up. it makes hillary and liberals look bad. i think a lot of people have checked in here and decided not to stick around. there's no reason why hillary couldn't have a  comparable presence to bernie on this site. i think this sub, and liberals in general, shoot themselves in the foot.

127,128,1,"right, i acknowledge that. my point is that those of us who fell for the propaganda propagated it ourselves. i was a pretty evangelistic sanders supporter until i realized what a self-serving ass he is."

191,192,1,"with all due respect, but the progressives ought to be smart in this cycle.  the people you ought to defeat are the republicans, not the democratic establishment.  i don't want to say this but if you go crazy, were will lose it all.  when you start attacking tammy duckworth, i am afraid you'll go crazy.  please don't."
192,193,1,"she caused trump.the amount of votes stein got in states like mi and pa would have gotten hillary elected.she didnt care about immigrants, and minorities who practically begged the holier than thou purity left to protect them when it mattered.she protests now because she's a grandstanding jackass who loves to get publicity.when everything is said and done she returns to her 9 million dollar house to sip champagne while rome burns.she's literally everything thats wrong with the regressive alt left.she eats, breathes and lives white privilege.frankly: pure neo nazis are less evil than susan fucking sarandon."
193,194,1,he needs to run home and retire and thats about it.
194,195,1,"https://twitter.com/davidmweissman/status/1021526470647267329>reason for this apology was because i totally brushed her off on anything she said. there were many reasons that lead my end support for trump, but i realize i disrespected her for completely ignoring her, and i have learned she deserved better than that.>what i am saying is, with hillary clinton being right with her predictions at the debate, confirmed me, that stopping my support was the right move, which is why i say in the original tweet, i should have considered what she said before i voted.>i hope this makes sense to everyone, i am thankful for all the support, it hasn't been easy, i am ready to fight in support for the blue wave. it's not only stopping support, in this process values changed from right to left, a whole other story that just happened at same time."
195,196,1,someone should slap him around a bit and see if he still wants to think something so fucking stupid like that again
196,197,1,so are you doubting that the russians were involved in hacking and leaking curated emails along with a false narrative about the primary being rigged? or are you doubting that the people who didn't get out to vote didn't care?
197,198,1,the goal would be to get a supermajority in almost every level of government (like the republicans have now) 
198,199,1,"if hillary and bernie people keep fighting, trump will win in 2020."
199,200,1,"> (based on principle and not just having a vagina and not being trump).if you think support for hillary was just about her ""having a vagina"" then you're part of the problem here - don't talk about having principles when you're making such ignorant and offensive comments. also, if you really wanted a female president, ,maybe you shouldn't be talking about one in terms of ""vagina"" and reducing them to organs. your prejudice is on display."
200,201,1,didnt say she did nothing. 
201,202,1,serious criticism or genuine arguments are something else than the shitheads who still troll this sub.
202,203,1,and yet some polls show trump winning a second term. it's almost as if the polls don't matter.
203,204,1,then why doesn't she do something about this?
204,205,1,it's his turn. 
205,206,1,excellent! keep going. love seeing a trump supporter so invested in a hillary sub. the insecurities are mushroom-like!
206,207,1,"it may be winning but it's using politics of fear. and as much as it's about hillary, it's more about the right's fear of the most powerful person on the other side of the aisle. that's why they demonized obama for 8 years. they demonized al gore. hillary is the only one who persisted against them. they'll do the same to bernie and anyone else who ends up leading the democrats. it's naive to think otherwise and make this just about hillary.the only reason fox news is still obsessed about hillary is simply because despite her loss she is still the most powerful voice on the democrats' side. you want her to get out of the public eye? heck, even when she was out of it, they were obsessed about her. donald trump wouldn't have beaten any other candidate? you know that for a fact right? you know that cause bernie was scrutinized by the right and fox news? the truth, which is difficult for fox news, gop and bernie bros to accept, is that hillary's loss didn't reflect the will of the majority of the country. her loss was because of a flawed system. and at the end of the day, she stepped away, and took her time and no one has stepped up to take charge in an adequate way. so she's still the most powerful voice."
207,208,1,"i don't think that's at all true. think about the united states when the constitution was being written: a bunch of states worried about what it means to give up their sovereignty. the small states wouldn't have joined without assurances that they would continue to have a say in how the nation is run. for example, the new jersey delegation's proposal had the president elected by a congress where each state received one equal vote. the drafters of the connecticut compromise (basically the system we have today) was very well aware that the electoral college it created would serve to ensure a geographically diverse national support for a presidential candidate. it serves that purpose quite well. if you imagine an election with two presidential candidates, where each gets 50% +1 votes in each state they win, the most lopsided scenario possible where one candidate wins the electoral vote without the popular vote still has the winner earning 49.6% of the vote. "
208,209,1,"i didn't lose the easiest president race in history, after cheating my way through the primary. "
209,210,1,"both spellings are correct for a news lede/lead so technically ""bury the lead"" is correct, though less common."
210,211,1,stop what? it's a poll. there's no suggestion of her running again so why jump to that conclusion especially in such a negative way.
211,212,1,go blue!
212,213,1,these people are traitors and should face some sort of consequence if hillary wins in 2020
213,214,1,"being civil is recognizing the humanity of others. we are fighting for civil rights while republicans are literally dismantling the civil right act. (i also agree with hillary, but the above is just another was of looking at it.)""in recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings, we pay ourselves the highest tribute."" - thurgood marshall "
214,215,1,"really? because bernie's whole thing has supposedly been about energizing voters. he does it with his angry old man energy, not by instilling doubt. stats show that instilling doubts only adds to voter apathy. he knows this."
215,216,1,it is known.
216,217,1,"agreed. i met hillary and bill when i was a kid. wonderful people. they took time out of their schedule to spend an afternoon with me, a terminally ill kid that wanted to meet his president. they were amazing. bill especially. "

218,219,1,i would expect some media from pro-bernie content producers to show up here intermittently if it has an anti-trump/republican message. i am surprised though that basically /r/sandersforpresident content from the bernie news corporation (tyt) has modest support here. this is not a flattering video for clinton.
219,220,1,the one aspect of comey's pr blitz i'm looking forward to is watching/reading/listening to the hypocrisy of everyone in the media who wanted hillary to shut up about the elections now grill comey about it. you can already tell that some are trying to avoid it but it is the juiciest bit of his book... eventually they'll have to especially as he continues to talk more about it.  let the double standards play out. 
220,221,1,w.t.f.any clearer indication of why we have trump? the 4th estate has become a sham.
221,222,1,q has everything
222,223,1,"you're exactly right. it's honestly just stupid circular reasoning that most of the time is used to brush aside legitimate grievances.improving the state of poverty is good. that doesn't mean the state of poverty is good. poverty having improved doesn't imply that the current state of poverty is good.maybe people of the past were more gracious (i honestly don't know). maybe we are less gracious. is that wrong? what does one even have to do with the other? people say the same thing about fearfulness. like, we are more fearful nowadays of a lot of things and that supposedly doesn't make sense because everything has improved. but that statement already assumes the fearfulness of the past is a rightful baseline. which is the whole argument in the first place (hence it is circular).besides it's possible to feel both good and grateful about progress without being contented or minimizing the current abysmal state of so many things."

268,269,1,"given your detailed reply which i appreciate, i think you're trying to find a lot of excuses for bernie which is fine if you follow bernie but not if you're a progressive or liberal.  you can either understand why bernie is not regarded as a genuine ""liberal"" voice for equality issues or you can just keep making excuses for him to one up hillary. i'm not the one continuously trying to compare the two like they're still running against each other. i'm simply stating the facts i know about bernie and why he's a hypocrite. >no, where do you read that out? it says, that not everyone who is from a minority is automatically progressive. thats why i gave you some examples, almost no left-leaning liberal would prefer a female/latina/black republican over a male/white/heterosexual (progressive) democrat.i guess then maybe we should reevaluate what ""progressive"" means cause if this is your view then most liberal democrats don't agree. if you think that the views of white male heterosexuals are more progressive than minorities  that's kind of questionable. very questionable."

300,301,1,"while i find this type of map interesting, i wish it accounted for population density/total number of votes rather than just who ""won"" and by what percentage.  here, a rural precinct with 25 voters total that covers a vast area is visually much more striking than a tiny city precinct with a hundred times as many voters.  if trump got 20 votes and clinton got 5 in a huge precinct, that's a lot of dark red splashed across the map.  and given that the electoral college is based on vote totals for the entire state (with slight exceptions in ne and me), it doesn't actually matter how many precincts each candidate won.i wish this were set up like the [population dot map](https://demographics.virginia.edu/dotmap/) so that all those huge areas in the midwest and west where no one lives would look like no one lives there.  i also don't get why maine has large blank white spaces where there are no voters and therefore no precincts, but other similarly rural states have similarly unpopulated areas colored in."

318,319,1,"if you want an outsiders perspective, it looked to me like the hillary campaign expected to win *because she was a woman*. it looked to me like her message was along the lines of ""it's about time we had a woman in the whitehouse"". and that's not enough to win, even against a buffoon. to an outsider her expectations appeared hubristic and that's what turned me off her. you can blame that on sexism if you like but don't forget to account for the sexism which hillary appeared to assume would work in her favor."

(and side joke, when she was first the press secretary, i told my thankfully liberal coworkers that all i could think of is, gosh she's so clunky it looks like caitlyn jenner trying to do a press briefing.) it just goes to show that america only cares about big mouths and big personalities. they don't care that hillary was the best for the job. especially since we still have men who think women should not have certain leadership roles. "
403,404,1,"i think a lot of posters in this sub are not acting in good faith. rather than focus on taking this country back from trump i see so many comments about fuck swing voters! you know theyre probably from russia or t_d, but still trying to divide the democratic party. remember how ignorant your friends and neighbors probably are, how many people are influenced by advertising and keep working towards a midterm that saves our institutions of freedom and holds trump accountable without being susceptible to the stupid trolls."

523,524,1,"that is the best way to make sure republicans win. look, for whatever reason, they've been able to make her the boogie man. they've successfully run against her for 20 years. (they've had power consistently with the exception of the financial crisis which swung the power for a very short time.)  every single candidate of theirs they convince voters is running against hillary. it is literally their playbook. to the point that currently, every republican campaign and conservative superpac feature her. i am not saying it is fair, it isn't. she needs to quiet down and run things like palpatine, quietly in the back where the public doesn't see or hear from her. if she stays in the spotlight, the conservatives stay in power. "
524,525,1,"i never read comments on videos, photos, articles, etc about her anymore.  they're way too horrible."
525,526,1,he's completely insane.
526,527,1,i'm having one of those mornings where i just can't see how this country comes back from all this. the leader of the country is blasting conspiracy theories in all caps on twitter and like millions and millions of people couldn't be happier about it. do they believe him? or do they like the game of it all? i don't even know. i really don't. and i see these people every day. neighbors and family and coworkers. it's bananas.
527,528,1,there are far more reasons why bernie would have lost. it's naive to think that he would have won in any scenario.
528,529,1,winston churchill's grandson had this to say about that orange coward who refused to honor the fallen because of a little rain: https://mobile.twitter.com/nsoames/status/1061270124404113408
529,530,1,"thats my state. its a vicious cycle. im in the highest ranked college in west virginia and a local all my life. im about to graduate and there is nothing here for me with my education and degree. myself along with my classmates and people i graduated with move out so we actually have opportunities. its incredibly unfortunate that its this way. if west virginia has some staying power it would grow and prosper. i might also add that im proud of my home state for not developing like the rest of the country. economically its a disaster and dont think because im going to an expensive college that i grew up in the minority in west virginia. my family was lucky to be considered upper lower class, my education is payed for with loans and scholarships. the reason im proud is because this state is so wild! its full of forests and wildlife. no matter where you go you are best weld in between large trees and mountains full of beauty. "
530,531,1,"c'mon at some point people should accept that their time to hand over control to the next generation has come. biden and bernie's generation has had control for 30+ years. at some point it's time to make way for a younger generation, less stuck in the old ways.then i'm not even talking about how tone deaf it would be to run another white dude from the stone age in the time of the women's march, the metoo movement, and the resistance."

533,534,1,"maybe this is a weird thing to focus on, but this article was so oddly framed.  it feels like the writer was talking to an american for the first time and noting all the differences in language, rather than interviewing someone with a lot of wonderful things to say.of course chelsea wouldn't say, for example, ""well done,"" because that's a british colloquialism, and chelsea is american.  i'm trying to think of an american equivalent, but we don't really have one, and i feel like that's because, ironically enough, that turn of phrase sounds incredibly condescending to my american ears. from what i gathered, the writer has a problem with chelsea's american syntax, word choice, and construction, and uses that to chastise her for being too aloof.  i think the point the writer was trying to make, if i'm being generous, was that chelsea is polished (and of course she is, as the writer pointed out, she's always been in the political spotlight), but then she (the writer) called her language clunky, which negates that point.  i think chelsea's extremely well-spoken, yes, just like her mother.  but, i'm sick of that being termed as cold, especially from foreign press who, in this case, doesn't seem to understand our speech patterns.  i loved what chelsea said, but hated the framing of it.  maybe the writer could have focused on her meaning, rather than the words used to convey it.  but i guess i should take my own advice and focus on chelsea instead, too. :)"
534,535,1,almost like the polls said that before. 
535,536,1,"she is a real presidential candidate, taking her role seriously, listening to experts, and trying to look out for the best interests of america and the american people. she knew things because she paid attention, listened, and trusted what she was being told, like any normal, real candidate (and president) would have. too bad she kept a private email server. automatically disqualifying. she should have just begged a foreign adversary for help. /s"

552,553,1,again why would you think moderates would rally behind her if they won't rally behind sanders? moderates would take biden over warren any day. so would a lot of progressives. moderates would rally being harris and booker over her. your rationale of her uniting moderates and extreme leftists makes no sense.she's a weak bernie alternative for extreme leftists.

587,588,1,">  because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. no, where do you read that out? it says, that not everyone who is from a minority is automatically progressive. thats why i gave you some examples, almost no left-leaning liberal would prefer a female/latina/black republican over a male/white/heterosexual (progressive) democrat. >  because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. it might be that he thinks a lot more in terms of class than other politicians do (if they do it at all) because he says he is a socialist. but still he made clear quite a lot that racial and gender justice is really important (to him).> bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative.come on.. i am pretty sure bernie knew hillary clinton from their time in senate together.. > maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a latina woman.he could have done that. but i don't know the centext.. i have searched for quite a bit but didn't found an article with the full question but i found one with the full (long) answer. yes, he could simply have asked what she wants to change or whats to do and when she replied he could than have said ""okay, thats great"" or ""yeah, thats not enough"". but what he could also have done is say that it is really important go get enough minoritiy candidates into politics but they also have to be progressives. i don't see a problem there. (even tough his statement beginns with ""let me respond to the question in a way you may not be happy with"", so its probably more than ""i want to be the first latina.."" but a real question)> you're the one, like bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing.where am i beeing very arrogant? and where am i reducing identity politics as a negative thing?> i mean bernie called her unqualified and his campaign manager branded her ""ambitious"" because she wanted to run for president.bernie replied to her, when she said that bernie didnt do his homework and that doesnt understand how to break up big banks and voters should ask themselves if he can deliver what he promises. then bernie just replied ""theyre going to question my qualifications, so i am questioning theirs."" and he repeated the same in a debate (""you might wonder about your qaulifications madame secretary"". and then he said why he is questioning them: iraq war, trade agreements, super pacs, wall street. yes, this might be a bit childish (bernie said that ""we"" shouldnt get into that tit-for-tat) but i dont think its sexist. it is basically ""being a women is not enough"" because you have to stand up against big banks and not take their money. and the ""ambitious"" thing is actually another context.. but okay, i am not here to say that every member of the campaign is perfect. but its a bit far-fetched to say that bernie reduced clinton to her identity because his campaign manager says, that she has ambitions to be president... thats basically a fact for (nearly) every candidate.> he dismissed trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction.no he said that this is shameful and its probably not against clinton but this would be against all women. a quote of the interview: ""maybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing america. donald trump will not look quite so interesting in that context."" he is not saying, that abortion rights are not important (which is insane to say if you know his voting record and his engagement for women rights.> and then there's his hardcore supporters coming after hillary supporters as vagina voters.and then there is the hardcore supporters of hillary coming after bernie supporters (but again bernie supporters /=/ bernie) who say that there is a special place in hell for women who dont support clinton. or that young women support bernie because they want to meet boys. or all the ""bernie bros"" that just support bernie because he is a man. > when he ran against a female governor of vermont he made it about her gender and how it would be sexist to vote for her because she was a womani dont know about the time, that was before i was born. what he said though is that many people are excited because she is a women but there is nothing more (because) he is the bigger feminist. i just dont know if that is true. but yeah, it would be sexist to vote for bernie if they just do it because he is a men. it is not (really) sexists to prefer a women over a men if you like them equally."

605,606,1,no state in america has ever elected a black woman as governor. she would definitely be making history.
606,607,1,im aware of the claim. but abortions are just one of a myriad of things i dont want to pay for. 
607,608,1,this is pretty much true also white people too
608,609,1,"it isn't sexism. at least, not just sexism. the only ""us and them"" that matters is capital, and labor. republicans, and democrats. after labor saw that it was going to be trump v. clinton, that was the time to rally behind clinton with all we had. that's what we did in 2008, and that's what's been done in every election prior to that that's ever been won: one holds one's nose, and picks the lesser of two evils. splitting the ticket only works for the other team, never one's own.it was a rookie mistake. it cost us the game. the damage will be severe, and long-lived.p.s.: almost forgot another basis of the ""us and them"": conservatives, mostly male, mostly white (and their financial dependents). and all of the rest of us (and our financial dependents. and there are many more depending on us to get it right than on theirs, because...capital, labor...i really thought you guys were too smart to be poached...)"
609,610,1,"> but this is how democracy works.except trump wasn't democratically elected. he **lost** by nearly three million votes. if this was a democracy, he would be the loser. the only reason he ""won"" was because of an archaic system designed to preserve slavery, a system that is now more than a century and a half obsolete.>i voted for a person who agreed with those positionstrump doesn't agree with shit. he's a demagogue who changes his positions as often as his socks. he was pro-choice for years, defiantly so, giving money to pro-choice groups and candidates. and then, suddenly, he shifted his position to dupe poor fools like you.> the democrats changing the rulesthe republicans changed those rules **after trump was sworn in as president** so that gorsuch could be confirmed."
610,611,1,"that's true. liberals and black women are probably the dem base.but the gender gap in voting applies across all races and educational levels.also, luckily, women vote more. women tend to be 52-54% of voters. "
611,612,1,it's because of her support for surveillance programs.

621,622,1,morning hillsters!
622,623,1,"this is what happens when you run a negative and divisive campaign. people are finally pushing back, and realizing that bernie and our revolution are part of the problem, and not the solution. "
623,624,1,that would be true if any of them had known what her policies were... 
624,625,1,"love you, too "
625,626,1,https://twitter.com/shanegoldmacher/status/988962401738543105ps: gop wins arizona.
626,627,1,"about that last remark: ofc not. most here have suffered two years of sexist abuse by what has become known as berniebros.you should see the private messages i still receive from /s4p regularsbut if there's sexism among a certain type of young white male progressives you're not going to change that by presenting some female candidates, but by discussing it.if i were to receive a dollar for every time some bernie supporter tweeted at me 'identity doesnt matter' when i tried to campaign for sharice davids, i'd be rich by now.it isnt identity politics to believe representation matters or to think that fighting the patriarchy should be an important progressive issue.i literally never see anyone dsa related speak about women's rights or feminism, do you?and fyi: i dont think these boys are sexist because theyre dsa, i think its just that being sexist is considered cool among a certain type of bros (chapo traphouse comes to mind).and finally: the boys i describe (cant call them men, theyre way too immature for that) arent really left or progressive at all.they want free weed, free college and whatever else bernie embraces."
627,628,1,"i am moderate but i don't mind seeing people like cortez bringing their ideas to congress. it's easy to be conservative if you feel like your and your family's future is relatively stable , but ideas like democratic socialism take hold because their is a wide swath of people who do not feel comfortable with their present or future. this brings their voice to the table. i don't agree with everything and on some points i probably actually lean conservative. take paid family leave for instance. i've had 2 kids and certainly that would have been more than helpful to get us through those early days. but i can look at the issue from the other side and see what would happen to school districts or certain healthcare organizations that are already barely keeping themselves above water if they had to suddenly provide for this expense. an idea that helps working families in one area is suddenly hurting kids in the classroom, because it is not just the googles of the world that would have to abide by a paid family leave law.  i do believe we need to be able to have a conversation with all voices heard. the conservatives have worked pretty hard to exclude liberals from the conversation so you will continue to see the far left get louder if that continues."
628,629,1,"let focus on democrats generally instead. this is a team sport, nobody's indispensable."
629,630,1,"im not voter shaming. im shaming the people who were either too full of themselves or too invested in convenient russian propaganda to vote. democracy is about power sharing, youll always either be left by yourself with nothing at the end of the day, or have helped someone who doesnt perfectly fit with your views. id much rather live in a world where politicians strive to be competent and realistic than one where they always have to play to hype in order to inspire voters who dont care enough to do any kind of research. "
630,631,1,"if hillary made a mistake in 2016, it was overestimating the number of ""sensible"" republicans and trying to appeal to them.facts aren't going to win them over.  arguing isn't going to win them over.winning will win them over, and that means nothing more than people getting out there voting."
631,632,1,i can't take anything susan sarandon says or does seriously anymore.
632,633,1,you don't even know what narrative you're pushing. follow bernie blindly. go ahead. 
633,634,1,"awesome!!!""the point being, im so happy youre not being silent. but i want you to talk, if you could, about that decision not to be silent. and also, how are you dealing with the constant barrage of attempts to silence you?hillary clintoni found this also very curious. because to the best of my memory, no man who ever lost a presidential election was ever told to shut up and go away. and im glad they werent, because each had points of view and experiences that were worth hearing about.ive given a lot of thought to this, and i do conclude  and i write about it in my book  that there is this long, long history of trying to silence women. literally in literature, in the western canon, it goes back to the odyssey.penelope is holding the whole country together while odysseus is taking his time getting back. shes raising their son, telemachus.theres a very telling scene where all the usual partiers and others are hanging around, hoping that shell finally decide that her husbands dead and marry one of them so that they can take over. telemachus is now about 17, so hes a young man.his mother comes down, as she always did, to greet people and listen to their complaints and to continue being the glue that held the country together. and her son greets her by saying, mother, go back upstairs. speech is not for women.the really terrific classics professor mary beard  who some of you know, and if you dont, look her up  has just written a book about women and power, in which she traces this whole line of being quiet: dont speak. dont speak up.now, for everyone saying, well, thats a hillary clinton problem. the people who theyd interview, saying, well, of course i would vote for a woman! just not that woman. in the last year and a half, what have we seen?"""
634,635,1,"so do you, hills. "
635,636,1,now the house judiciary committee gop members want to re-examine hillary clinton's emails!! they are totally insane. 
636,637,1,"exactly!!! just like that time when before the election hillary wore all white and was deemed by the media as ""looking very presidential in all white"".and then after the potus was elected the media painted melania as a racist and supremacist for wearing an all white gown.man why does everyone always hate on hillary :/"
637,638,1,"on another note, this entire fiasco demonstrated how completely disconnected and oblivious many old school political operatives had become in today's fast-paced online media wars.  it should have been obvious to anyone who spends more than 20 minutes online that this whole thing was going to blow up in their faces.ctr was a small operation with pretty tame goals.  but it became the bogeyman for *every single fucking comment* on reddit and around the internet that a) was not pro-trump, b) was not pro-sanders or c) was not anti-hillary.  so many political debates were casually dismissed with a ""well, you're obviously a ctr shill""  amidst a sea of approving upvotes.even today, i wonder if dave brocks has any clue just how damaging the whole thing was.  i fully understand the mission and goal (and the need) for ctr, but the project was handled terribly."
638,639,1,that would just encourage the gop to continue to massively lie about anyone they dont like as eventually it will work to remove that person from power.  lets not feed the trolls (gop) and lets just publicly and loudly correct the record.  nancy pelosi rocks.

640,641,1,oh...nice!
641,642,1,only in a few newspapers...
642,643,1,the few people i know who voted for trump are now saying a lot of discouraging things about him and are showing signs of regret. im quietly thinking to myself i told you so. the electoral college needs to be abolished!
643,644,1,"we need to stop giving a fuck what his supporters say or do. only one thing matters. resisting their violence and evil incessantly, and voting in november. "
644,645,1,not to mention all the other pro-business crap he will sign off on. 
645,646,1,they are all imbeciles. i wonder how they can look their famalies in the eye knowing they lie for a living.
646,647,1,edited for clarity. sorry. 
647,648,1,holy shit fuck it's a real site
648,649,1,"you'd think that at some point people on the right would become skeptical of constantly being told that clinton is hiding under their bed and then finding nothing.  how long can the gop keep using her as their boogeyman? she hasn't held office in over five years, and after multiple investigations not a single charge has ever been brought against her.  meanwhile multiple of trump's close associates have been indicted and convicted of felonies just this year.sooner or later someone's got to wake up and realize that the emperor has no clothes."
649,650,1,is anyone having trouble scrolling to the bottom of the comments with this new reddit format? it is only happening when i'm on my lenovo desktop. on mobile devices i can scroll all the way down. am i missing something?
650,651,1,"wasn't trolling, nothing i said was facetious or a lie"
651,652,1,it's not one or the other.  it's just different sections of the same big blue tent.  don't fall for the republicans desperate attempts to divide.
652,653,1,"why is this posted in our sub?the sub the political revolution actively helped trump win in 2016, by none stop telling people not to vote for hillary.."
653,654,1,"um, i was making fun of great awakening for being so stupid. "
654,655,1,arizona gov. should nominate sen. flake to mccain's post.
655,656,1,i'm basically voting a straight blue ticket. usually i do keep an open mind. sometimes i do vote republican if that person seems like a moderate and the alternative is too far left to my liking. right now the republican party has lost it's god damn mind. the only logical and sensible alternative is to vote blue now and vote blue in 2020.
656,657,1,"""interesting"" misinterpretation of some facts - by omission and twisting words. how come bernie's anti-immigration statements are never played and ""analyzed""?"
657,658,1,i dont know about that. i didnt vote for bernie in the primary. and a lot of what you said is true. but i dont see it as his fault. he wasnt the one claiming it was rigged. it was people like his jack ass campaign manager who complained about it being rigged. i like that bernie is a senator and he has a more important voice than he did. i do hate the nasty rhetoric against hillary to this day and will follow us until after she dies. but as leslie knope said in 2010 hillary is the biggest punching bag in america 
658,659,1,this is my exact feelings. he boosted trump and shot hillary in the back. fuck comey forever. fuck you comey.

686,687,1,"stating facts how? you haven't stated one fact, merely opinions and statements. you're so bold in your own world beliefs that you claim they are just fact without even considering any possibility that other opinions could be true as well. this is why you seem uneducated, and as a side note. i do feel really bad for you. you've been replying to me for a few days now and you simply can not let go of something and are desperate to show me it is fact, when you know deep down it isn't. if it was a fact, then you would just need to state it and move on. since you are here and still arguing with me about your opinions and my own, shows me that you truly don't believe in yourself and want to force others to believe your statements as true just so you can gain confidence that your opinion has truth in it to others. word of advice, there is no such thing as facts when dealing with politics. all politics across the world and through out history are all based on personal beliefs and opinions. just stating what you believe is fact, doesn't make it so. especially politics.

703,704,1,"ocasio-cortez is a lying hack.she tweeted that rep crowley was mounting a third party challenge to her in her district.that was a lie, word for word.as crowley explained: ny's complicated rules make it impossible for him to remove himself from the ballot: https://mobile.twitter.com/joecrowleyny/status/1017408249513955328but he is not in any way shape or form challenging her run.a pseudo progressive lying about another dem, hmmm somehow rings a bell?"

705,706,1,"i finally just watched [michelle wolf's routine](https://youtu.be/l8iypnnsyjw), and there was maybe one part that was a little too much, but i easily belly-laughed 4 times. very funny delivery! maybe she was too funny? if people can't make fun of themselves then something is very wrong with their self-esteem. i dont even think her best jokes were about huckabee, maybe the softball teams part, but otherwise it was hilarious. "
706,707,1,not surprising but i still pity the fool.
707,708,1,because she would be a candidate that everybody can get behind. the moderates like her because she's a fighter with a strong anti-trump record. the progressives like her because she's a strong advocate for progressive policy positions.

709,710,1,"it was literally a continuation of bernie's campaign, which was also disorganized. and it's not even me saying that, it's from the real people that were posting about it on s4p. and bernie's campaign was basically just a continuation of occupy, ffs, another group in disarray."

721,722,1,"how is it anti bernie?did you even read the article?the article documents that under nina turner or has become a shit show.it documents that long time bernie surrogates like lucy flores have left the organization and that others are close to leaving.it also states more than once that bernie is critical of these developments.bernie did not endorse assad/ trump lover kucinich.if anything, the article is anti nina turner because she's killing bernie's movement.and fyi: that criticism has nothing to do with hillary.but if all fails: attack hillary, cuz we know the bros lack any kind of critical thinking."

731,732,1,what is the deal with the 'youtube left'? i don't think i have ever seen a leftie youtube video on a current topic. it's like outside of general topic videos (which i really like) it's mostly bickering with each other or praising each other or attacking youtube alt\-right people.like there so much going on to get angry about or even just express anything to show that you are informed and care. and yet it seems like it's all silence all the time.i find myself unfollowing most of them because at some point saying nothing while so much is going on is a statement of its own.
732,733,1,"i have to say, this is why i love this sub.the first two comments i see are stressing how this site, while perhaps having a point, neither has concrete evidence or the reputable reputation necessary to make such a claim.  which isn't to say it's impossible, but that this isn't yet enough to substantiate the idea of russia changing votes directly. because we're hillary voters and we need some evidence and facts first before we can make a real judgement.

737,738,1,so a bail out for people who didn't understand what they were getting into would have prevented trump? is that your opinion? 
738,739,1,"oh i agree, but shes got a good enough history of opposing trump that she can survive an abstain vote. if she makes the case that her abstention cancels out mccains and that its in the republicans hands, a lot of independents will be able to stomach that. especially given how much shes opposed the party recently.all just my opinion, but the overgrown scrotum that is the leader of the senate majority has an iron grip on his party. if shes openly opposing potential judicial nominees now without much backlash its because hes letting her.either one of two things happens, imo. shes either saying this because a moderate judge is already en route and she can take the praise from dems and flack from the hard right, or so that she can abstain if a hard right judge is nominated and let pence push it through."

769,770,1,"while i think she'd be really great for the country, i want to see a sample size of women candidates that is more than 1. if another woman runs, we can then see if the nation treats that woman exactly the same as they treated clinton or if they treat her differently (more rationally). i sadly think the nation will treat her just as insanely as they did clinton, but that will mean we as a society can no longer use clinton as a scapegoat for our collective misogyny and we'd have to admit that we treat female candidates differently. right now people say ""it's not that she's a woman; it's that she's hillary clinton."" "

801,802,1,gotta say china plays it smart by hitting states that went for trump.trump is an imbecile if he thinks he can win a trade war with china.but then: economists and others warned for years that leaving the tpp and nafta would basically give all influence and economic power to china.

805,806,1,she also took it for granted that she was going to win and chose to hide out instead of campaign for fear of being asked questions regarding the emails. it was big news and she didnt want to answer anything about them. so she hid out and waited for trump to hurt himself with his hubris but it backfired on her badly.

837,838,1,yet you take the time to lurk and comment on here. why so threatened?
838,839,1,she won the popular vote by more than many presidents who won both the popular vote and electoral college.  i feel like that should be getting talked about more and changes should be made.
839,840,1,"yes and it's a good thing we weren't doing it at all like we are now. in 2015 these facilities were primarily used for unaccompanied minors who crossed the border without guardianship. the conditions these kids were kept in was still horrific and wrong. keeping kids in cages with thin mattresses on concrete floors is disgusting. doesn't matter if you buy them new clothes or whatever.what has happened in the past year is that the use of this program was expanded to asylum seekers and used more aggressively with people entering the country illegally. in this way the cruelty has been compounded to a level that i frankly never imagined this country was capable of.. and given that multiple administration officials are on record as saying the purpose of this is to deter asylum seekers, i think we can assume they know it's cruel. that's the point."
840,841,1,not to mention there are more than 100 women running for congress this year and not a peep from the ocasio-cortez people about that.
841,842,1,"i've heard that said since the day after the election, so i doubt the recent social media post about was the original source. but i have no idea who the original source is either.anyway, exactly!!!! it's spot on. "
842,843,1,"not just conservatives, even bernie supporters dont care. they cared about the emails when it meant attacking clinton and they could care less now."
843,844,1,theres that video of him saying creepy things to teenage daughters of congress-people getting their pictures taken. i might have previously dismissed that as old awkward man being old and awkward but in light of all that weve seen in the last few years it pulls at my stomach. shame really because i think hes a very effective communicator and popular in eastern pa which is important. 
844,845,1,they are going to be so mad when clinton is elected president in 2020.
845,846,1,">the president of the united states was fleeced, and worse, has no doubt impressed upon kim that this country can be played for fools and strung along. trump gave kim newfound legitimacy and kims nuclear weapons program can go on and on.>in all of this, **pompeo**, trumps secretary of state, bears a good deal of the responsibility for excessive happy talk. he apparently was led along as well, resulting in the decision to put trump in the room with kim. *pompeo has insisted that this would not be a repeat of past errors. hes right on that. this is much, much worse.* national security adviser **bolton**, who tried his best to disrupt the meeting, can feel some measure of satisfaction. having seen his advice spurned and the disastrous results that followed, he might consider quitting. he would be a powerful, independent voice to explain the peril in which we now find ourselves with a president who alienates allies and gives tyrants around the globe reason to celebrate."
846,847,1,he's an embarrassment. 
847,848,1,entire gop is complicit. 
848,849,1,"i'm not advocating for her running again but your argument is the same regurgitated nonsense as always. she lost pa despite campaigning there so heavily she may as well have been living there: pa was where the polls all had her comfortably leading throughout, she has roots there, the democratic convention was there, the had multiple big rallies including the final one with bruce springsteen, both obama, bill clinton, etc. ditto florida for that matter.     in wi other democrats eg russ feingold who campaigned locally in wi lost by much more than she did. with michigan, the state dems specifically asked her campaign to stay away, and wanted to run the game themselves despite mook trying to send money and resources. of course mi was lost.   in all three states, there was enormous amounts of votes lost due to machines not ""working"", voters removed from rolls, incredibly long lines (no early voting in pa). she didn't not play the game - it was rigged against her. "
849,850,1,"in terms of what this article is trying to contextualize, there is indeed a ""liberal tea party"" but the point they're missing is that the democrats/liberals are not weak as the gop and the conservatives were back in 2008, especially in terms of ideology, to let a fringe group take over. or at least, the dems are far more aware of the threat and danger of this kind of internal ideological warfare than the republicans were. it hasn't been easy but i think the democrats are handling it far better than their conservative counterparts did.  the republicans basically capitulated to the extremists from the extreme right wing factions. thankfully, the dems have not done so completely. there was a danger in the beginning but it seems to balancing out."
850,851,1,yep. the propaganda machine is running strong.
851,852,1,"clinton isnt immune to criticism, she is better than trump so i voted for her, but she isnt flawless"
852,853,1,"""fictitious scenario""? do you even know the person who you worship to this extent? do you even pay attention to what he's been saying for the last two years?? "
853,854,1,what??https://twitter.com/isaacdovere/status/998637364217106433
854,855,1,"> if you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.i never said this. nobody actually ever says this. they say (something like) having white skin is a privilege.  that's different than legit thinking that all white men are privileged. i mean, obviously, we people in los angeles don't think this.  we see white homeless folks every day.  the right willfully misinterprets this, just like they did with black lives matter (too)... not (only) black lives matter.  to be honest, i'd like there to be a better word than 'privilege,' because it gets easily misinterpreted... but, then, when you have a massive machine trying to discredit liberals who want to get rid of the bigoted oppression of individuals based on what 'group' they belong to, any phrase you use will get twisted to be intentionally misunderstood.   ""sad to say but democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican.""  this is far from true.  most republicans voted for trump.  he is a fascist bigot who openly stated he wanted to ban all muslims from entering america.  you are engaging in a false equivalency.  ""its not about privilege, race or gender."" for people who are oppressed, daily, based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion?  yes, it is about that.  a poor black dude faces oppression that a poor white dude does not.  this doesn't mean a poor white dude has an easy life - that's not how existence works.  like, the fact that my skin color doesn't cause me to be oppressed... that doesn't mean my life is sunshine, roses, gold, and happiness. it's just that society does not oppress a poor white dude because of his whiteness. the greatest trick ever pulled was to oppress people based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion... and then, when folks try to fight back against identity-based oppression, yell that the folks pushing back against that evil are the ones engaging in divisive 'identity politics.'

863,864,1,uh look at that? an inflated economy means people have jobs. who knew? me! meanwhile what's our deficit assholes? dats the real indicator. 
864,865,1,wapo rules!
865,866,1,"there's a case to be made. hw had only four years in the house compared to hillary's eight in the senate. being rnc chair is a political job that doesn't translate much to the presidency. bush is generally considered to edge her out on foreign policy - but he only spent two years at the un, one at the cia, and just over a year in china, so arguably four years as sec state (which is more involved in policy-making) is at least a match for that.hw probably wins out overall because he was vice-president (and a very active one in reagan's later years in office) which has a similar sort of general advisory role as hillary's tenure as first lady, but is more formal and powerful. but other than him, hrc was more qualified than pretty much any other candidate in years (excluding incumbent presidents of course)"
866,867,1,"you dont owe anyone on reddit anything. but this kind of attitude is a big part of why we lost. youve implied im a bernie bro to demean me, even though i voted for clinton.her 2016 campaign was lacking in olive branches. it was described as divisive, which unfortunately seems to be going strong in 2018. hopefully the 2020 democratic campaign will be better.

872,873,1,"not sure why you think i get all my information from fox.  and once again it is proven that when people want to have a discussion all that happens is the other side resorts to calling people idiots and tell them how it's been explained over and over.  your refusal to acknowledge the facts on both sides shows your inability to find a compromise and solution.  that is why we are where we are today.  everyone fully understands the difference, but the left refuses to acknowledge the fact they did shit about it when it was happening on their watch.  kids were literally in cages, unlike today...  but, yeah it was totally different!  get the fuck outta here with your bullshit.the best part is the left just sits out there and screams, ""look at these poor children""! oh, the horror of being fed, clothed and sheltered unlike where they just escaped from...  but, hey you wanna make it political and play stupid fucking games, cool.  trump will sit there and let it happen, because he didn't make the rule he just enforced zero tolerance with it.  so, tell me again how it's trump's fault?  he did not create the problem...  congress let it happen!  period!"

(evan vucci/associated press)most of our assessments of the electorate in 2016 are dependent on estimates. polling before the election that suggested where people were leaning; exit polling after the fact that gives us some sense of who actually turned out. when more than 137 million people vote, understanding exactly who they were and why they voted the way they did necessarily involves some guesswork.on thursday, though, pew research center released an unusually robust survey of the 2016 electorate. in addition to having asked people how they voted, pews team verified that they did, giving us a picture not only of the electorate but also of those who didnt vote. there are a number of interesting details that emerge from that research, including a breakdown of president trumps support that confirms much of his base has backed him enthusiastically since the republican primaries.the data also makes another point very clear: those who didnt vote are as responsible for the outcome of the election as those who did.as we noted shortly after the election, about 30 percent of americans were eligible to vote but decided not to, a higher percentage than the portion of the country who voted for either trump or his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. pews data shows that almost half of the nonvoters were nonwhite and two-thirds were under age 50. more than half of those who didnt vote earned less than $30,000 a year; more than half of those who did vote were over age 50.pews data allows us to see very specifically how voter turnout and candidate support compare. by looking at the preferred candidate in a demographic group and then comparing the density of that group in the population that voted with the density in the nonvoting population, we get a sense for how nonvoters determined the 2016 results.well start simply. women tended to prefer clinton to trump and made up a higher percentage of the voting population than the nonvoting population. that split alone helps explain clintons popular-vote victory.but women contains multitudes. black, working-class democratic women; white, wealthy republican women. the split by party shows how that makes a difference: republicans made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool and, unsurprisingly, broadly supported trump.(remember: were not comparing actual turnout to the pool of registered voters  were comparing percent of voters to percent of nonvoters. in a world where voting doesnt vary by demographic, the percent of voters from any group would be the same as that groups percentage of nonvoters. if a demographic group votes less than another, though, it will be below the centerline while the other group is above it.)looking at race and ethnicity, we see how the heavier turnout of white voters affected the contest. black and hispanic voters voted much more heavily democratic than white votes backed trump, but they turned out less.while half of nonvoters were white, 74 percent of voters were.an even more dramatic example of that comes when we look at age groups.people under 30 preferred clinton by 30 points but made up much more of the nonvoter population than the population that actually voted. a third of nonvoters were under 30; only 1 in 8 voters was in that age group.heres what the income divide in pews chart looks like.each of these demographic groups contains fragments of the others, of course. some of those earning under $30,000 in income are republican or black or female. if we overlap race and income, the dots above separate a bit.whites making more than $30,000 a year skewed republican and made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool. poorer whites and nonwhites generally made up more of the nonvoter pool than the voter pool.income and education generally correlate, but the chart looking at education and race is remarkably different from the chart above. college graduates leaned toward clinton  but whites without college degrees voted heavily for trump. nonwhites without a college education were 40 percent of the nonvoter pool and only 1 in 5 actual voters.evangelicals were the most strongly pro-trump of the religious groups of voters, and they represented more of the voting pool than the nonvoting pool. black protestants and hispanic catholics made up less of the voting population than the nonvoting population  and strongly preferred clinton.if we step back and look at the bigger picture  all the demographic data points from pews analysis, including those above  the expected trend emerges.demographic groups that preferred trump were three times as likely to be a bigger part of the voter pool than nonvoters. among groups that preferred clinton, they were about 50 percent more likely to be a bigger part of the nonvoting community.clinton nonetheless won the popular vote. but an increased turnout of under-30 voters in, say, wisconsin, pennsylvania and michigan could easily have changed the results of the history."
909,910,1,"i get so sick of the lazy ""bad candidate"" argument. she got 3 million more votes than bernie. she got 3 million more votes than donald. she won every debate. she had a better convention. she didn't campaign in michigan or wisconsin because she was never losing in michigan or wisconsin. just because we all have the benefit of hindsight doesn't make her a ""bad candidate"" after the fact. she did have a huge rally in pennsylvania with michelle obama.she lost because:- james comey- republicans were allowed to use tax payer dollars to hold bogus investigations and hearings during an election year.- the media treated her fake 2 scandals (emails/benghazi) equal to donald's many real scandals (russia, access hollywood, attack gold star parents, trump university, trump's taxes, trump foundation, etc).- misogynistic voters- complacent voters- easily fooled voters (especially anyone who voted for jill stein)edit- russia!she had zero control of any of those things. she did what she was supposed to do. she was a good candidate."

914,915,1,comey ain't my homie.
915,916,1,he actually confirmed quite a bit of what omarosa has said. i will be buying his and hers now.
916,917,1,"there was an article on slate about ""abolish ice"" and whether dems should embrace it for the ""energy"" it provides to ""the base"" or moderate it in order not to put off moderates and ""energize"" the right in opposition.i tend towards the moderates, but, either way, a relatively well-informed commentariat went at it pretty strongly in the comments for quite some time.  more importantly than whether they embrace ""abolish ice"" as a campaign slogan, it's sad to note that the left is still having petty squabbles when they agree 90% on policy.  abolish ice vs. reform ice is almost entirely the same thing.  the main difference is rhetoric.  the same was true about hrc vs. bernie.  i really don't get why the left is so susceptible to this stuff right now."

992,993,1,"what you're saying is only an unacknowledged truth. the fact remains that both politicians and the populace largely insist on keeping up the polite fiction that qualifications and fitness to be president are among the most important criteria by which we elect them. politicians and the voting public also like to claim that they are meritocratic and objective, and not at allllllll sexist or racist, not us, no sir, maybe that other guy over there but even he's only suffering from economic anxiety. people who point out how the most qualified candidate in modern times lost to the least qualified candidate in modern times are doing so in order to show up that polite fiction **as fiction.** we are trying to point out how this election showed us to be liars. we vote based on prejudices and propaganda. we do not give a shit about qualifications to the extent that we elected trump rather than let a woman into the oval office."

(don't remember the number, but it's not small.)  anyway, he goes on fox and lies, he lies on twitter, he lies at pressers, and nobody on the right gives a shit.  when fox news points out a lie, fox news ratings go down.    so fuck it, why don't we just run a presidential candidate who goes out there and says: >""you know what, i'm pro-life as fuck, life begins at attention, and anyone who says otherwise is a communist.  also i believe in medicare for all and a $21/hr federal minimum wage phased in over my four year term.  also i shoot lots of guns all the time, just for the fun of it, big ones too.""  *wink wink*  the republican *voters* wouldn't notice the middle part, just the bits at the beginning and the end.  hell, donald trump once said that the government should pay for your health care, because ""well someone has to do it.""  they didn't care, they were pro-public health care that week, to the left of bernie if it meant aligning with trump.    we run our candidate, and we just lie, say whatever they want to hear (while winking at our base the whole time), then govern however we want to govern.  when they ask us questions about why we're expanding abortion rights, we'll just keep lying.    >""wait... president effort, this would nullify all the trap laws in the nation!!""    >""no it wouldn't.""    >""it's called the 2020 trap law nullification act.""    >""no it's not.""    >""but fox news is saying that the 2020 trap law nullification act will nullify trap laws nationwide!""    >""fox news is lying to you.""    >*""planned parenthood is building a 60' tall granite sculpture in your honor, the plaque reads 'the day trap laws were nullified nationwide by president effort's 2020 trap law nullification act,' and quotes you saying how pleased you were that trap laws were a thing of the past, and you were proud to have nullified them!!!""*    >""anyone who's seen my record knows that i am no friend of planned parenthood.""    >""your record says that you dramatically increased their public funding.""    >""that's the wrong record.""  then we just win!  i guess.    if lying to the voters meant that we elected a president and a congress that would act against climate change, would it be worth it?  let's not mince words here, democratic policies save lives, if the past eight years of fumbling through obamacare had proved anything, it's proven that.  with that in mind, how many lives could we save if we did what the republicans were doing?  gerrymandering the states, unbalancing the judicial bench, targeted election laws... okay that last one feels gross... but you get the picture.    we always think about the worst case scenario, but let's ask ourselves about the best case this one time: how much practical good could eight years of dedicated democratic governance do for this nation?  hell, i'll be arrogant, how much good could it do for the *planet?*    health care, wages, research and development, labor laws, financial regulations, tax justice, environmental protections.... we could use the tax code to incentive vaccine research, and federal revenues to fund promising-but-not-profitable technology.  we could save lives, and improve the quality of the lives we saved, not just for ourselves, but for the world.    if we lied.    ---    edit: i was angry when i wrote this, which is probably obvious.  look, i *love* michelle obama, and god knows there isn't as much traffic on the high road as there used to be, but taking the high road doesn't do anything to help the people that drown in puerto rico, the people that hillary, or bernie, or barack, or bill would have bent over backwards and jumped through hoops to save.  moral and ethical superiority doesn't help the dead.  hell, jim webb and lincoln chafee, our most conservative 2016 candidates, would have been out in paddle boats.  i worry that people are losing their lives because we refuse to play to win."

1178,1179,1,"one of the reasons the obama administration may have seemed so ""corporatist and neoliberal"" in effect is that any policy remotely leftist was blocked by the gop congress.  remember, obama only had half of one term (heck, even less after the death of kennedy) to enact his policy changes, and in that time he was almost entirely focused on healthcare reform (with consumer protection being his other achievement).  you play the cards you're dealt.  "
1179,1180,1,i'm all for the narrative here but wtf are you talking about? bernie endorsed and spoke on her behalf at the convention.
1180,1181,1,"im for women having whatever choices they want. with their money, not mine. birth control? fine, pay for it. abortion? fine, pay for it. kids? great, you raise em and you feed em. "
1181,1182,1,"there are so many good candidates.;)i think i prefer harris or booker, but dont rule out castro and holder (yet) and murphy and kennedy.i'm kinda fed up with gillibrand, but she has time to improve i guess.;)"
1182,1183,1,"this is what happens when you run a negative and divisive campaign. people are finally pushing back, and realizing that bernie and our revolution are part of the problem, and not the solution. "
1183,1184,1,"""why do people who hate government need it the most?"" that's a question i've actually heard asked.  i know lots of people don't like to ask for help because it makes them feel bad about themselves but the fact of the matter is, sometimes, circumstances are not on your side."
1184,1185,1,do you think we'll ever get some numbers on how much trump's campaign blitz is costing taxpayers?
1185,1186,1,those are some amazing women.  i've read about several of them during this cycle and should learn more about the others.
1186,1187,1,this is pretty incorrect. trump never ran on the idea of home loans getting repaired or any other offer about those who lost their homes 10 years ago...right now (august 2018) the republicans are not running on anything for the mid-terms near the idea of offering home loan banking corrections. trump hasn't lost one person in his original base because of this. trump ran on and won because of racism other white people saw clinton as an extension or 4(8) more years of obama and they did not want it. there is no such thing as economic anxiety 
1187,1188,1,"why?the left refuses to even give warren, let alone harris a chance.."
1188,1189,1,i am excited to see hillary on rachel and colbert this week! 
1189,1190,1,"> who gave mi, wi, and pa permission to not recount their votes?article one, section 4, clause 1 of the constitution.  "
1190,1191,1,"we're not finished, and we prolly never will be.doesn't mean we can't, or shouldn't, keep trying."
1191,1192,1,more people should be calling out this foolish pussy(grabber). in some ways i'd love it if obama finally started swinging back at this asshole but he has too much class and would never ever sink to the levels of the likes of trump.
1192,1193,1,why are you guys still talking about emails? inst it time to move on? 
1193,1194,1,"okay, then disregard everything ive said. after all, you dont care what i think, and i understand that."
1194,1195,1,it's not one or the other.  it's just different sections of the same big blue tent.  don't fall for the republicans desperate attempts to divide.
1195,1196,1,"this is exactly what pains me.  the far right will hate any democratic candidate but there is an inordinate amount of lingering hate for hillary on the left.  i'll support whoever our candidate is, obviously, and would gladly vote for hillary again.  "

(him being a minority still plays into the identity politics argument of the article too, of course.)but it's painfully obvious when you look around that it's largely a misogynistic angle they take.  you have nancy pelosi, maxine waters, kamala harris, elizabeth warren, and even alexandria ocasio-cortez (who isn't even elected yet, but has become the right's go-to for attacking the left).  the amount of coverage waters/ocasio-cortez get given their relative political insignificance is astounding."

1208,1209,1,"bernie refused to endorse her until mid-july, months after he was mathematically eliminated. he called hillary clinton unqualified to be president, and lied that she had made the same comment about him, after he suffered a bad loss in early april. the primary was -over- in april, but bernie still tried to attack clinton. then in june, he offered to debate donald trump on live television (again, after hillary was the presumptive nominee... all bernie wanted to do was give himself, and donald trump, some more of the spotlight).his supporters then protested the convention, booed over elizabeth warren, chanted ""no tpp"" over barack obama, booed marcia fudge, booed civil rights leaders, booed sarah silverman when she said ""bernie or bust"" is ridiculous. they literally attempted to eat beans and simultaneously fart to clear the building (yes, this actually happened https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/sanders-fans-plan-dnc-fart-protest-clinton-nomination-n611596)sanders enabled that behavior by making his most volatile supporters his delegates. they even booed *him* when he said to elect clinton (https://youtu.be/rth6ydbm-wa). he created this monster and never tamed it or took responsibility. he never condemned their actions toward roberta lange, he never condemned them throwing dollar bills at hillary's motorcade as if she was a stripper, he thanked a man for introducing him at a rally after that same mad had just called hillary clinton a ""whore"" in his introduction.even in bernie's own speech, he doesn't mention hillary clinton until 12 minutes into the speech (aside from one throwaway line 'this election is not about hillary clinton'). compare that to hillary's 2008 convention speech when the first thing she does is giving a ringing endorsement of barack obama and helps redirect her supporters' passion and enthusiasm to him."

1313,1315,1,"republicans are the corporate party because they take corporate money. a good chunk of the democratic party also take corporate money. the difference is that usually all the republicans fall in line with the establishment so they can actually push through their gross agenda while the democrats are almost always split on every issue because half of them take so much money from the rich, so whatever gets done is an extremely watered down version of what the left actually wants. obamacare is a great example. what the left wanted was a single payer healthcare system, but obama (who was a great president don't get me wrong) didn't like negotiating, so he went right to the compromise which would have been a public option. republicans used this as an advantage by then making a compromise of the compromise: an individual mandate system which is the old-school republican idea.war is another great example. when obama took office, he didn't hold bush or the republicans accountable for entering a war with a country that didn't attack us. in fact, he expanded it by getting us into 7 interventions (trump got us into an 8th one). the most embarrassing one might've been when obama introduced gun reform and an incredibly watered down background check didn't even pass. republicans have taken the democrats shift to the middle as an opportunity to go extremely right-wing. this happened because democrats thought people would think the democrats would seem so much more reasonable by compromising, but humans are inherently tribalistic and many don't actually care about the policies, they care about their team winning. donald trump is a great example, who rallied against war in the primaries and republicans backed him up (nows he's super pro war and republicans are still backing him up because this is about ""yea that's my guy, that's my team, go us"" mentality). basically what i'm saying is that if democrats stop taking corporate money, real progressives will win primaries because they aren't facing up against fundraising (by the very wealthy) from the economically center right democrats and there will be more than just a few real progressive voices in congress. then i think we can finally work on getting money out of politics. i view getting money out of politics as endgame because republicans are really good at using their massive amount of money to advertise their policies that hurt the middle class to the middle class. (for example the estate tax was turned into the ""death tax"" because people went ""oh shit, i'm gonna die. i don't want that to happen to me"" when it only affects an incredibly small amount of people and their bratty kids still get loads of money. i didn't even know i had this much to say haha, but i'd like to hear your view on things. sorry if you read this to the end, cause wow that was a lot.

1380,1382,1,"> he assumes that this lady, just because she identifies as latino and is a woman, doesn't care about economic issues. that's his fallacy there - he can't see that someone who is a woman and a minority can also address economic issues.thats more than just false. he just says, that being a progressive is more important for him to support other candidates than being black or a women. he just puts the ideas of a candidate first. i can't see a problem there.. as i said, of course we should support a minority/poc or women over majorities/white men - but their policies even above that.> you guys need to stop conflating gender in this way and behaving like support for a woman or a minority is just down to the identity.than stop saying bernie wants to dismiss identity politics because he says exactly the same that you just said. (""i supported hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. i didn't support palin cause she was a woman."") that means, that you supported clinton because of her ideas and not because of her being a women and you didn't support right-wing women because of their politics. thats exactly what bernie says (""being a latina is not enough"") but it still matters because ""we need 50 women in the senate. we need more african americans."".> so again, no one is saying that someone should be elected just because they're a woman or black or latino. only bernie is saying that.would have been a lot more time efficient for both of us if you had said that earlier.. > reduces his opponents to their identities. he did with hillarydo you have a quote?"

1417,1419,1,you make a fair point about this essay - a lot of people post it without context or explanation and it's sort of become a meme for people who don't like bernie but it's definitely not to trigger past traumas - it's more about pointing out the  hypocrisy surrounding him especially from his most ardent supporters who refuse to address his past in any way.and in terms of relevance to this post -actually it is very relevant to both the post and the op's comment especially if you read his full essay and understand what he's saying about gender roles (which the npr article does not). his essay is a perfect example of how women face different standards from men. how they're judged differently from men.  and this comes out in his essay not from what he says about women but how he says it. he focuses on the woman who fantasizes about being subjugated. he focuses on the woman about choosing different parts of her self and soul. he doesn't apply that same standard to the men. that says a lot.it might be 45 years old but this essay explains a lot about how bernie treats women's issues in the modern day. i feel like people should take the time to understand that.

1494,1497,1,"that was a big concern if she won. with the first dem 3 peat since fdr, the buttery males witch hunt, russian trolls playing people....also add rose twitter and others on the far left leaving her out to dry in the midterms  (while complaining how we don't have free weed/college yet under a gop congress), a 2nd term would've been hard to win.

1499,1502,1,"thank you, and exactly. people don't realise there is a lot of historical precedence for this. -andrew jackson won the 1824 popular vote but lost the election, then came back and won four years later in 1828.-grover cleveland won the 1888 popular vote but lost the election, then came back and won four years later in 1892.-richard nixon barely lost the presidential election of 1960, then decided to run for president again and won in 1968.so not only is there precedence for a candidate who won the popular vote running again and winning, but there's also precedence for someone who already ran for president and lost running again and winning.and in fact, *every* person who won the popular vote for president and lost the election who then ran again *all* won the next time. of presidential candidates who won the popular vote but weren't elected president, there are only those who won on their next run (jackson, cleveland) and those who just didn't run again (samuel tilden, al gore) who nevertheless would've had strong cases if they'd wanted to run again."

1521,1524,1,"bruh, you drank the kool aid. her policies were great. the eventual dnc platform was the most progressive in the party history. the problem was that if you told someone that hillary supported something, theyd come right back with nuh uh shes just saying that to get votes, even when it was trivial shit that almost any democrat would support. people were seriously acting like shed become a hardcore republican upon taking office. her track record says otherwise.

1523,1526,1,this isnt about political correctness.this is about certain people trying to close any discussion about racism or sexism with the slur: identity politics.discussing violence against women has nothing to do with identity politics.in fact the only ones engaging in identity politics in this thread are white males who feel uncomfortable about the realities this article speaks about.using the slur identity politics in discussions like this is simply an attempt to silence people.

""lets try this guy"". a know-nothing, endemic narcissist, corrupt, lying, sexual harasser, self-aggrandizing, pompous, caustic, rude, man! whose whole character screamed not presidential.yet people have the nerve to complain today ""oh my god, he tore up the iran deal"" this man said during the debates that he had no qualms bombing families and the causalties that came with that! is america so f****ing stupid! ( i know the answer is no.... just 3 states... i get it) but still, every single damn day--corruption and ineptitude flows from the head down constantly, consistently--and this party--this dead party of lincoln, emulate chagrin and indifference. it's sickening, absolutely sickening!i'm 23. i voted in potus election--first time because i was finally eligiable, and it goes without saying we know who the competent indivdual would've been. but my god--the nerve from some journalists to media outlets that these people had to put trump and former first lady, secretary, senator, magna cum laude on same playing field! just a joke!and the stain, from history onward will not be kind to america. we need a course correct like yesterday! vote, encourage others to vote, trump and his cohorts cannot continue in this manner of violating norms, and denigrating institutions. it just cannot be. forgive me for the rant, but i just get tired of these nonsense headlines, consistent corruption pruitt, conway, munchin/manchin, and trump! he lies, and then acts stupid about it. how can this america tolerate this? it's so unbecoming, and lord help us if he somehow wins a second term. i don't knkow what i would do."

1580,1583,1,"my career's in tech infrastructure and security (more infra than security, but i'm not ignorant), so that's where my perspective is focused here.would there be direct evidence?  in a well-run setup, possibly. depends on how good the hackers were.in almost any of these setups?  fuck no.  all the circumstantial evidence others are complaining about is *probably* the best the public's gonna get.  i can't speak to legal status, but in the tech world, the evidence michael harriot laid out in this piece is more than enough to answer the kinds of questions we tend to have.  those questions boil down to essentially one:given the available metadata (logs, audit trails, system monitoring histograms, diffs between backups and live data, etc), *can we trust that this system wasn't tampered with*?that question itself is generally made up of two smaller ones:  what *do* we know? and what *can* we know?  i almost started basically typing out the article in my own words, but i'll skip that part.  between how badly-secured these systems were (both design and implementation, and all the way from end-user to database backends), how badly audited and logged they were, and how badly backups were kept (if any), i think most competent professionals would generally agree on these points:* we know attackers gained access to live voting systems/databases* we know end-user voting machines are embarrassingly easy to gain access to.* due to bad security practices of many kinds, and in at least one case deliberate deletion of backups, *it is not possible* to verify whether or not data was changed in many of these cases.in the computer security world, if you can't verify something, being thorough means you must assume the worst-case scenario.  how you deal with it depends a lot on context but to stay focused: this means that we as technical professionals *must* assume rolls and votes were tampered with.the malfeasance and incompetence continually demonstrated over the course of the last two decades or so of modern electronic voting in the us has the general public in a position where anyone with a strong enough political lean can accept or dismiss the available data as they wish.  the pattern-matcher in me wants to think that's on purpose but that's neither here nor there.as an industry expert, the 'case' presented in this article is highly convincing.  ""can we trust that these systems were not tampered with?""  no, full stop.  will we ever have *direct* evidence that votes were changed? given the mismanagement involved, i very strongly doubt that.  is that enough for a legal case? i have no idea. if i were brought in to fix the situation? this is more than enough."
1581,1584,1,understood. all im saying is that neither you nor i nor they know conclusively what was going on inside of this mans heart and mind. i believe their conclusion most likely is true. however i think maintaining a degree of skepticism and being mindful of the limits of our knowledge and ability to know is very important in such matters.

1607,1610,1,"great, except they will likely never face prosecution. what i'm really waiting for is indictments of the treasonous americans that conspired with russia to steal the election."
1608,1611,1,i can think of a few things
1609,1612,1,"the good news is that his support seems to be dwindling (yes, yes, yes...i know all about that stupid poll that you guys clutch to like trump does to the electoral map), and our rev endorsed candidates are getting beat in every important election, but if you want an honest answer, yes we need to take him/them seriously because they're still buying into his nonsense. you're proof of that.bernie will run in 2020 because of his massive ego, and it's an easy way to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars from poor people to him and his cronies. i mean, hillary broke her arm several weeks ago when she accidentally stepped between bernie and a microphone. so, let's assume he is. he will probably win iowa because white people and caucuses. he will win nh because he's from a neighboring state. then what happens in nevada? that will be interesting, and where bernie supporters lost their minds in 2016. who comes out of the first 3 to challenge bernie? then supertuesday and the southern primaries. this is when bernie got crushed, and was basically mathematically eliminated. of course, he didn't want to do the honorable thing, and concede. no, he wanted to stay in, so he could milk as much money out of you suckers for as long as possible. it worked! bernie won 4 out of 13 states, with 2 being caucuses (of course) and 1 his home state. but now we have included california! so, does harris run, and win california and most of the southern states? that could be a big blow to saint bernard. once again, getting crushed by dems most reliable voting block - black women. if she doesn't run, does cali give bernie a huge boost? could happen.does bernie win enough delegates early because of the other dems splitting the votes, so he can win - just like trump? does the dems concede early, so that doesn't happen? does someone come out of nowhere to take it like often happens?do dems challenge bernie, and does he actually get vetted by the media and his opponents? does biden run to save the dems from bernie and trump? who knows, but yes i think it would be a mistake to ignore bernie, and treat him with kid gloves like last time....

1619,1622,1,gold. the new womens suffrage movie sounds promising!
1620,1623,1,"it isn't obsession it is winning. whether we like it or not, conservatives have made hillary the boogie-man. they have been winning by running against her for 20 years. every single republican candidate runs against hillary. in every ad and speech.  you know what, it works! they have been winning for 20 years. the only time they really lost was because of the financial crisis. other than that, they win by keep drumming up the boogie-man (hillary). as long as they keep dragging her out, they will keep winning. everyone is excited for 2018, sorry, they will keep both houses because they will keep running against hillary. if she would get out of the public eye maybe *maybe* the left could win. i am not saying it is fair, i am saying it is reality. i voted for hillary every chance i had. facts are facts. they win because they successfully branded her the villain. they won't lose until the left moves on from their current leadership (all in their 70s) and bring in new leaders. at least the right will have to work and branding new villains. again, donald trump is the president. donald trump, a reality star buffoon. that is how successful the right was at branding hillary the boogie-man. donald trump wouldn't have beaten any other candidate.edit: i am fine with the downvotes folks, the truth hurts when you don't want it to be true. however, have the character to come back and apologize to me when the republicans hold both houses after novembers election. if, somehow they don't, i will come back to r/hillary and happily say i was wrong.

1621,1624,1,"comey's explanation in his book was something along the lines of the email investigation was already publicly known and much farther progressed. comey comes across as an earnest person, but he definitely couldn't see the forest for the trees on these two matters. it's like a cop spending all his time on a soaped windows complaint and missing the dead body on the front lawn next door."

1630,1633,1,"yes, white nationalists should stop bringing race into everything."
1631,1634,1,"none of the strategies worked because they were barely covered compared to trump. no one cared what jeb!, marco, or ted cruz were saying, the media was waiting breathless for trump's response. cnn showed an empty podium waiting for a trump comment instead of hillary's speech on infrastructure at the same time. either people will be sick of trump's lies or the democrats have to make a spectacle of themselves to get heard and walk the thin line of not making fools of themselves in the process."
1632,1635,1,"well, i tried. the relationship between liberals and conservatives is probably the central political issue in this country, and by far the most divisive. you challenged me to get a discussion started, that was my topic - relevant to this interaction and relevant to the current state of our country and its future. also related to comments you already replied to. you responded like a troll. yes, i am lecturing you, and you need it. most people, conservatives included, agree on a pretty logical next step on most policy issues. there's not a big divide as far as needs and sense of morality. it's an issue of respect and appreciation of other people. you don't have it. also getting the feeling i've been going back and forth with a high schooler who hasn't been around long enough to develop a mature perspective on things. am i right?"
1633,1636,1,your response and reasoning there is exactly why our founders implemented a republic not a democracy.

1636,1639,1,"not *that* hard to believe. their debate live reporting was incredibly weird and slanted against clinton in the pettiest ways, while largely refusing to even mention that trump was an addled, sniffing disaster. i never got the impression that they were particularly married to truth, but obsessed with false balance instead (which also explains their gushing profiles of nazis, hiring climate change deniers and so on)."
1637,1640,1,good. this is why i liked hillary. she was a centrist compared to trump or bernie. knee jerking to the left just because the right chose to jerk to the right is not the solution this country needs

1642,1645,1,"what do you mean ""that's all we need?"" she can make a decisive impact?"

1649,1652,1,"true, but even without it, distributive ledger technology seems promising. i picture a system where people can vote either online or in person with a universal free id system where each vote can be audited and checked against a system. if a credit card can decline a transition certainly we can have a system that would decline vote if it was illegal or already used. then afterwards the voter could check an online ledger privately and confirm their vote for the candidate was correct as intended. obviously this system could also be set up to make sure the associated id was not one of someone deceased, someone who isnt a citizen (russian for example) or if someone voted for someone else wrongfully. say my parents took my id and voted on with it, i could contest the vote if i checked it with my private key. just some ideas, nothing is impossible when its this important."
1650,1653,1,"indeed, but i'm buoyed by the recent arrest of maria butina who connects the nra/gop/rubles and mueller's leaks. did you catch bernie's campaign manager, tad devine, all over the evidence list against manafort that mueller just released. i suspect bernie and the bros were part of the plot and running interference.

1663,1666,1,so glad his past is finally being brought up outside of reddit.
1664,1667,1,"the media is making a killing off of this. hate to sound anti media, but honestly, have any jounalists stepped up their game lately? besides rachel maddow and stephanie ruhl? how long are we going to have to endure idiotic acceptance of lies from trump? "

1667,1670,1,we may never know but i really want to know who wrote this piece and what their history is.  i also wonder how genuine they were in the article.  they said some things that made it pretty clear they're a conservative.  i've seen people around the internet suggesting it was pence.

1685,1688,1,"the amount of exclamation points you use is astounding:-).  i literally just contradicted your claim, and then you handwaved it away...  like, it's okay to be wrong.  just admit it.  she came out in support of weed like 1 or 2 years later than kamala did.  and again, your argument needs to be with policy, not age.  there are plenty of younger dem politicians to her right.  in ca, not in ca, etc.  she supports a medicare-for-all buy-in program.  it's smarter and a better transition than single payer.  i still don't get how 'be like canada' is so much more progressive than 'be like france, germany, japan, etc.'  "

1689,1692,1,howso? 
1690,1693,1,a lot of anti-ctr was probably coming from russia shills and the circle was complete.

1692,1695,1,">but it's also not like the media's treatment of her was unprecedented when compared to bill, gore and kerry.it absolutely was. the media entertained conspiracies about her in a way they never did with bill, gore and kerry. she was scrutinized far more intensely than those three. and heck, she still is far more scrutinized. did you see the media attacking gore the way they attacked her for speaking out after the election? there were different standards at play here."

1695,1698,1,amen!
1696,1699,1,pennsylvania and florida mattered more than most of the midwest. 
1697,1700,1,the problem is that the election was decided by an electoral college that is in no way recognizable to the spirit of what the college is supposed to be. the federalist papers describe a body that functions as a check against any unfit or foreign-influence candidates... far different from the math game its used as today that allows both parties to focus on campaigning in just a handful of states.
1698,1701,1,i miss the bad old days of shitposting here between 538 updates. oh what could have been.
1699,1702,1,"i'm suspicious that the congressional races both this year and in 2016 were targeted as well, especially when i compare some of the polls from 2016 to the final results."
1700,1703,1,so sam seder thinks that bernie won't run if warren runs and will be her greatest surrogate?? i mean that's just bullshit. if that's the case then bernie would already be campaigning for her instead of insinuating that he's running. and frankly we haven't got any hint that warren is going to run.this is all wishful conjecture from seder.if warren was going to run she would have done so in 2016. warren can certainly play a part and should but democrats need to move away from that generation of presumptive leaders. 
1701,1704,1,good

1705,1708,1,"""grandpa bernie"" is probably the worst you'll see here... you're offended by this??? this shit we see on wotb and the donald is ten times worse. but okay, let's compare this sub to the donald when bernie subs have pretty much been donald surrogate subs. "
1706,1709,1,"sad thing is, there were enough people to elect her father. they aren't going away."
1707,1710,1,thats crazy. imagine if we never found those emails she was purposefully trying to hide from the public!
1708,1711,1,labelling people by their political affiliation? real progressive. 
1709,1712,1,"no. in my local community the county board of elections received instructions from the state republican party to reduce early voting capability as much as possible because democrats rely on the flexibility more. they also removed a voting location away from a historically black college to nudge things in their favor. as part of a statewide plan, these nudges add up. it's straight up an effort to keep people from voting. it's undemocratic and un-american.with voter id, it's a question of motives. if there is no voter fraud problem in my state and the current verification methods work, why ask for voter id? the belief is that it will further disenfranchise democratic voters. it's another nudge and another effort whose real motive is to stop americans from exercising their rights."
1710,1713,1,"i just want to say how much i support joy reid and samantha bee. i'm not saying they are perfect or above criticism, but the rest of the media could learn a thing or two from these two women.seeing so many cnn personalities going on and on like they are some kind of moral authority \-\- after the bullshit we all watched cnn do the past few years \-\- makes me remember why i don't watch that network. they clearly look for any little opportunity possible to go after ""the left"" like they are trying to constantly prove that they are balanced. and it's always under the guise that they are ""just having the conversation."" cnn is the umpire who has been so intimidated by the republicans that they can no longer call balls and strikes."
1711,1714,1,same. i only have so much time in a day and i really cant be bothered to delve into every detail anymore. ive lost about two years of my life already. call me when they get don jr or something. regardless its a great thing but its not what gets me jazzed. 
1712,1715,1,"i'm not rooting either, but i won't be surprised if it does happen."
1713,1716,1,must have missed where she ran and secured the republican nomination for potus.
1714,1717,1,so excited for this! the show is awesome!!
1715,1718,1,"no because conservatives don't really give a shit about wether or not the candidate ticks the token female token black card. we care about what they want to get done, you guys should really consider alexis ocasio cortez aswell, shes 3 boxes checked off at once! "
1716,1719,1,"no actually, the military budget was on a downward trend under obama. and military spending isn't just about the middle east. trump's admin is conducting far more under cover military operations in africa and other parts of the world. "
1717,1720,1,this website was so massively brigaded in 2016 it still stuns me.
1718,1721,1,this website was so massively brigaded in 2016 it still stuns me.
1719,1722,1,glad you agree.
1720,1723,1,she's literally the most qualified person to ever run. and the fact that you think she's a serpent and untrustworthy is due to 20 years of republican smears and sexism.  
1721,1724,1,"pms included it's a wash now, sorry if you're dealing with that. but i think i understand their original point. they were calling out someone for trolling and more power to them. i don't think you were trolling however.one thing i see on reddit comments a lot is a second person coming into a thread with their own thoughts, and the first viewing it as an attack rather than an additional thought in a conversation. i viewed that as happening both directions with you two.don't want to jump into this too much though, i just felt like sharing my thoughts because it's clear you both were passionate in your responses and it was upsetting to see them interpreted as attacks both ways."

1742,1745,1,watching all of this must be especially hard for you. i'm watching now and also have been drawn to watching megan mccain because my dad too is a vietnam veteran. he is still alive but not in the best of health so i've been trying to prepare myself but know there is really no way to do that.
1743,1746,1,as much as i'm excited i'm dreading the next announcement where trump nominates an actual barrel of nuclear waste as chief. 
1744,1747,1,"no, i got that that's what you're saying. but think about the sorts of things a governor does. they create policy, they lobby legislators for that policy, they run the state government bureaucracy. things like that. there's a bunch of stuff _that does not actually require government office to have experience in._ likewise, holding elected office does not automatically grant you that kind of experience. for example, the mayor of new york or a few other cities might have handled running a similar bureaucracy... but legislators would not have that experience. there would be very few non-incumbents with that sort of experience, so it's a little ridiculous to expect it as a prerequisite for the same reason it's silly to expect ten years experience for an entry level job. nixon has run a multimillion dollar non-profit, though, so she does have executive experience. and her legislative experience is going to be about the same as a typical legislator, except that she doesn't get an actual vote and she doesn't get the paycheck."
1745,1748,1,"i'm not sure if you debated with any trump supporters before the election but one of the main points they cited was that he was a successful businessman.  they didn't want to know about the bankruptcies and unpaid bills, they just seen him as rich "
1746,1749,1,"when people state hillary had no message, or think her campaign slogan was im with her, then i know they werent paying attention and dont have arguments based on reality. "
1747,1750,1,"it was his only good slogan. i can't remember any from his 2012 run and ""change we can believe in"" from 2008 was... meh"
1748,1751,1,"how do you know? with due respect, do you have access to his heart and mind?"
1749,1752,1,"well, directly before your quote, he states:> it goes without saying that as we fight to end all forms of discrimination, as we fight to bring more and more women into the political process, latinos, african americans, native americans  all of that is enormously important, and count me in as somebody who wants to see that happen.and then: > right now, weve made some progress in getting women into politics  i think we got 20 women in the senate now. we need 50 women in the senate. we need more african americans.only after this, hes says that being a latina is ""not good enough"". and concludes:> in other words, one of the struggles that youre going to be seeing in the democratic party is whether we go beyond identity politics.so it is just wrong to say that he is dismissing identity polictics, in fact it reads to me as a approach of intersectionality. ben carson ist black, but not necessarily better for black people than an average white democrat. same with condoleezza rice. and even though you dont like bernie, he is more in favour of women rights, than sarah palin would have been as vice-president... so clearly i have to agree: being black, a latina/-o or a women is not enough. clearly we want to have at least proportinate representation of all members of the society and thats why he said ""we need 50 women in the senate"" and why he said that we ""need more african americans"".. that clear to everyone on the left. he then says that we have to go beyond identity politics, not to dump or dismiss it, but go beyond it, in other words: add progressive politics to it.for me its really simple: i support the one with the best ideas - is it an advantage if the one is a person who experience discrimination? hell yeah, if there is a good women, i'll take her over the men. a good black person, i take him or her over the white one and same for homosexuals and transgender. but still, having this attribute alone is not enough, i have to agree with the politics .. thats why i supported bernie sanders and not hillary clinton. if elizabeth warren would have been in the race, i would have routed for her and would have been angry at bernie for not withdrawing and supporting her. and yeah.. if a black politician who has good politics would have been in the primaries i would have supported her and probably him."

1754,1757,1,"i can not stand bernie.  i've said this before, but he's nothing more than a left wing trump, and his supporters are a trump like cult."
1755,1758,1,"well said. this is a pretty important point actually. > personal experiences, however flawed, can overrule global truths if left unchecked i've noticed this in my own life/thinking. it took some time to recalibrate and be able to see the big picture again. "
1756,1759,1,i just looked him up. youre right. he caucuses with republicans for some reason? he seems like a legitimately terrible state senator. i think my sister lives in your district ill tell her to vote for you 
1757,1760,1,this is an unfair comparison.  obama was competent.
1758,1761,1,"i voted for bernie in the primary, but became disillusioned when his supporters were clearly playing into gop propaganda. when he lost handily on super tuesday, i faced reality and said, well, its hillary now and shes my candidate, and didnt think twice. i, a straight white male with all the privilege in the world, did not throw a fit, complain about rigging (because people of color voting is not rigging) or play into the enemys message like so many other bernie or busters. i have a strong dislike for bernie now because he is mostly responsible for his own cult of personality. he spread the falsehood of the primary being rigged and never detracted from so many of his supporters misogynistic rants about hillary.

1766,1769,1,"i love them both so much. i posted a rbg quote about the supreme court and for the few that were in the smaller sub (not r/wayofthebern btw) and it was not a warm reception, it was the first time ive experienced it from that angle honestly, given my experience. they were averse to it on the ground of blah blah identity politics is bad - and i dont disagree that bickering to no end is bad, like lets focus on goals, but im also a gay dude and an ally to women, and believing rape victims or properly revering them anyway, is not identity politics! i was disappointed. so im catwoman. but elizabeth is all about holding the banks accountable too. its about all of the above, and im so definitely about her!"
1767,1770,1,"it sickens me to keep repeating this, but trump was already talking about how the election was ""rigged"" (thanks bernie!) and he would contest it if he lost.  the last thing we'd need would be for obama to give him the excuse.everyone talks about russia, comey, the emails, etc.but the fact is that if the state-level pollsters had gotten things right, then everyone wouldn't have assumed hillary was going to win regardless of all these things.if the race was seen to be closer, then maybe comey would have avoided making his 11th hour email announcements (or equally announced the trump-russian investigation) and hillary could have put more effort into the states she assumed she was going to win.even trump didn't think he was going to win."
1768,1771,1,i've never understood the feinstein hate from the left.  does she advocate 100% of what i want 100% of the time?  nope.  no one does.  she is a fantastic and effective legislator.  that's all i ask for for a dem in the senate.

1772,1775,1,hmm apparently barbara bush supported planned patenthood.i didnt know that!
1773,1776,1,"so i find it funny that the media have resurrected the old ""democrats don't have a message"" while willfully ignoring the actual messaging from democrats except when it's trump or bernie using the democrats as a punching bag.there's plenty of democrat messaging going on yet you have publications like the daily beast publishing hillary bashing articles by gop strategists, passing them off as ""journalists"". i read this ""article"" from liz mair... a whole lot of garbage. she basically admits that bashing hillary is a public service to republicans like her.so how can the media legitimately criticize the democrats when they themselves publish partisan bullshit like this. yet again, bigoted trump supporters aside, we have the media proving why we have trump in the first place.

1839,1842,1,"a heloc is not a bailout. it allows a homeowner to tap equity from their home. the ideal reason to do this is to eliminate high interest credit card debt or do much needed repairs on a home. a renewal heloc would have simply paid off the existing heloc, and then given the same terms as the first heloc for another 10 years. if anyone thinks that's a bailout then they are more hard hearted than republicans.as for trump, it was the combination of an agreement between hillary clinton and barack obama to not admit to anything that could look like an oversight or mistake, including not responding to bernie sanders and some crazy claims he was making against hillary clinton. then factor in obama's not so nice comment about the heartland having a lot of bible thumping, gun loving, bitter over losing jobs, people.the less hillary went into the heartland, the more the heartland felt that trump was the only candidate who was willing to not stay quiet and who did not want to raise taxes. i'm suggesting that hillary clintoin losing moderates to trump was a 1 or 2 proposition, every moderate hillary clinton lost meant two votes for trump."

1849,1852,1,"great read. especially in context of hillary supporters and the validation of what we've been talking about since nov 2016. comey's book and his shameless promotion seem to have finally woken some members of the msm about the impact of his announcement and the hypocrisy of his justifications. a little too late but at least there is acknowledgement in terms of slow realization. that gives me hope. >as jonathan chait explains, comeys willingness to let such concerns influence these episodes reflects the success of a decades-long campaign by republicans and gop-aligned media to skew the political dialog by hyping fake scandals, which in this case led comey to act to avoid charges of favoritism, thus willingly handing bad-faith actors leverage over law enforcement. its hard to read comeys npr interview as anything other than confirmation of this. worse, comey also revealed that not allowing this to happen would have been a perfectly appropriate outcome.>all of this implicates the medias conduct as well  both before and after the fact. though comeys last-minute email revelation admittedly created a complicated editorial conundrum, it was widely hyped by the media in a manner that was surely disproportionate, given that at the time, no one knew whether the emails amounted to anything at all (which, it turned out, they didnt). as nate silver has shown, the episode may have helped tip the election to trump.>**when supporters of clinton made these points after the election, they were widely derided for being in denial about the real reasons clinton lost.** the notion that comey and related over-the-top press coverage might have played an important role was greeted  including by some neutral reporters  as self-evidently, uproariously, knee-slappingly absurd, as if it constituted nothing more than hopeless partisan brainwashing."

1854,1857,1,"so to be clear, the article seems to admit there isn't actually any evidence that votes were in fact changed in the election.  as has been noted many times previously, quite a few voting ""systems"" were compromised in one way or another.  ie, a staff member's workstation was compromised at a county election board office.  the author here looks at the circumstantial evidence and concludes that the russians *must* have manipulated data in georgia's voting system.  but it's still just his own speculation."

1874,1877,1,hillary's not holding back at all anymore.  it's a bit sad that she probably felt like she had to hold back until she was done running for office.
1875,1878,1,ny wouldn't be one of the bluest states without a progressive governor. nixon had progressive ideas and rhetoric but no track record. i'm sure ny voters would have taken her more seriously if she had done something like run for congress first. you can't call her a progressive governor based just on her rhetoric.  and this will be the trend everywhere - aoc was one high profile win but clearly democrat voters are not about electing candidates on populist rhetoric alone. 
1876,1879,1,why? if it's an issue then you think we should just keep quiet? 
1877,1880,1,the election was so close that of course it played a part. but i think her status quo attitude toward everything in politics and her constant meaningless clichs played a bigger part. her run to the middle and her hawkish worldview made her seem more like a republican to the average voter than a democrat (which i guess isn't really the party of the left anymore)

"
1904,1907,1,"a white mans life is different depending on the city, state and region you live in and economics plays a huge role.  if you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.  i didnt say white men are oppressed and i wont say their privileged either, they live a human life.  the homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him hes privileged and thats why you wont give him any money.even trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  if white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.a year ago i moved from oklahoma to los angeles.  the two cultures are so vastly different.  the democratic party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country thats why we are where we are at.  in oklahoma where i was apart of the democratic party, the hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in oklahoma as sexist and say thats why they wouldnt vote for clinton but at the very same time we had a female republican governor running the state.  texas, kansas, louisiana, arizona and many other red states have had female governors while states like new york and california have not.its not about privilege, race or gender its about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.  sad to say but democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican (trump  is not average).  obama brought people together clinton divided.  we all lost when her campaign started dividing people and it started long before trump got the republican nomination."

1907,1910,1,is this your standard response to anyone calling you out? if the party is failing it's because it's trying to accommodate people like you who can't even go beyond vague criticisms which you can't even substantiate.  the party will stop failing as soon as it realizes that people like you are only looking to divide not unite. that was the biggest failing in 2016.

1943,1947,1,you make a fair point about this essay - a lot of people post it without context or explanation and it's sort of become a meme for people who don't like bernie but it's definitely not to trigger past traumas - it's more about pointing out the  hypocrisy surrounding him especially from his most ardent supporters who refuse to address his past in any way.and in terms of relevance to this post -actually it is very relevant to both the post and the op's comment especially if you read his full essay and understand what he's saying about gender roles (which the npr article does not). his essay is a perfect example of how women face different standards from men. how they're judged differently from men.  and this comes out in his essay not from what he says about women but how he says it. he focuses on the woman who fantasizes about being subjugated. he focuses on the woman about choosing different parts of her self and soul. he doesn't apply that same standard to the men. that says a lot.it might be 45 years old but this essay explains a lot about how bernie treats women's issues in the modern day. i feel like people should take the time to understand that.
1944,1948,1,its to prop up smaller states. you know like the ones where a certain candidate chose not to campaign in and then lost. its actually working perfectly. 
1945,1949,1,uh look at that? an inflated economy means people have jobs. who knew? me! meanwhile what's our deficit assholes? dats the real indicator. 
1946,1950,1,i never said it was smarty pants.wth are you doing in our sub anyway? still trolling after 2 years?
1947,1951,1,"i was about to yell at you thinking she was like 55. but she'll be over 70. i don't really care about age but i could understand the desire for younger blood. for me, i just don't want to see her brand of populism. she's right about a lot of economic issues but she also grand stands. i don't think she can be impartial when it comes to considering sensible legislation. if it a law even happens to benefit a bank or insurance company in anyway she will be obliged to blast it. and who knows where she will land on the us military. i can't envision her ever giving a tough military order. at least trump knows to basically stay out of it. he talks and talks, but no one at pentagon is listening. that's scary for all sorts of other reasons, but a more attached president would have had a major showdown with military brass by now. i'd be interested to hear what she says about handling military. maybe i'm wrong."

1954,1958,1,she did not. 
1955,1959,1,i dunno theres just something about her i cant put my finger on.... /s
1956,1960,1,he claimed that he was smart for cheating the usa out of paying his fair share for all the opportunities we have.
1957,1961,1,especially on r/hillaryclinton
1958,1962,1,look there is a whole cottage industry of reporters who dumb things down for idiots that have spent far too long watching fox news. i'm not one of them. you want to know the difference between today and 2014 go look it up.endless reports about specific actions taken by this administration and here you are saying they have nothing to do with it. just go read a fucking newspaper and stop trolling the internet. it's not hard.
1959,1963,1,that's what should happen.  but we all know we're stuck with that living piece of trash.
1960,1964,1,not for government business
1961,1965,1,"privileged much?if your life stayed the same you're basically showing yourself as a privileged white guy.if you're muslim, refugee, black, latino or lgtb your life sucks and is threatened every day by this administration. if youre part of a union, your rights are taken away as we speak.if you're a woman you might lose fundamental healthcare options with the governments attacks on reproductive rights/ pp.if you would really be a liberal or progressive you wouldnt just vote for your own private interest but you'd know you need to stand up for people who are vulnerable.no wonder you didnt find her inspiring, her appeal to fight for women, lgtb, poc, people with mental health issues and the working class went right over your selfish head"
1962,1966,1,"i think this is the media jumping the gun  a bit - listening to this interview it really doesn't sound to me like she's thinking of running - she said ""no"" pretty clearly. to the question.  i think she's more saying she wishes she had become president (of course she does, as do i!) and believes she's qualified to be president (which she is).  she might be genuinely interested in another stint as secretary of state however, given her point about reminding the world, currently confused by trump, what america stands for."
1963,1967,1,"nope, not as long as they apply criticism and double standards to women.fyi: it is entirely possible to criticize female politicians on the issues without singling them out as women."
1964,1968,1,most courageous and hardworking woman. 
1965,1969,1,"it could just mean that gender isn't something they include in their hopes of who becomes president. a better question would have been ""if trump were a woman and hillary were a man, would you have changed your vote?"""
1966,1970,1,what are you talking about? she was in therapy because of this assault. you never forget!!! i'd come out if someone who attracted me was to become such an influential person for life!
1967,1971,1,two nights ago i had a dream that she did and it felt great. 
1968,1972,1,gottem 
1969,1973,1,thanks to bernie for not dropping out of the race so she could focus on the important things.
1970,1974,1,ctr shill was thrown around so much. r/politics had a massive problem and they never really owned up to what happened. the sub was completely overrun by bots and trolls. 
1971,1975,1,"what i think will happen: democrats take house in 2018. in 2020 republicans will ride democrats on not getting anything done while having the house. democrats win presidency, loses house, but gets senate back. "
1972,1976,1,"i wasnt the only one who said you were sexist, because you werenice distraction though. the fact remains you arent in any way shape or form a hillary supporter. you attack nancy pelosi on our sub (luckily the mods removed your post) and youre a berniebro stanning for bernie.and yeah: by all means: dont address it because every word i wrote is true.it would be nice to see a berner address bernie's greed and jane's self-enrichment, but oh well."
1973,1977,1,"i realized today... there are *so many* subreddits dedicated to hating on trump and the republicans, but the ones dedicated to the party who is working to fight trump and the republicans and promote the progressive policies that people want - the democrats subreddit - only sees a fraction of the traffic that the other subreddits do. why are people so afraid to latch onto the party that is working to help and fight? they only want to complain, not work to implement solutions. "
1974,1978,1,so many of her speeches ended up being prophetic.  i wish more than anything that she were president.
1975,1979,1,"see, you already know. "
1976,1980,1,"well damn, that's a low bar"
1977,1981,1,it's not really losing when your opponent stole the election. 
1978,1982,1,yeah i'm not surprised at all. he *was* an artist at one point but for the past few years he just seems like he's bought in to the kardashian pr machine which is all about getting publicity at any cost. but maybe even before that because in hindsight his bush comment is no different from his taylor swift debacle - all for maximum publicity.  he's releasing an album soon so this is his pr push... and that's even worse. 
1979,1983,1,"the thing that bothers me the most about a potential impeachment, and one of the few things that bothers me on the same level as trump, is his cult.  i wouldn't put anything past them and we've seen over the past two years just what they're capable of.  they'd probably be more horrible than ever if he was impeached.  the way he's given him the courage to act is truly deplorable."
1980,1984,1,"well firstly, he cant try to take it away now. and shes showing the world shes not looking to use or abuse her security clearance to influence anything against him. "
1981,1985,1,sorry not sorry.
1982,1986,1,i wonder what the numbers would have been assuming the russians/gop had been prevented from hijacking the voting machines
1983,1987,1,yes!!! absolutely!!!

1985,1989,1,"well she's never been wrong about this shit yet, so people better listen. "
1986,1990,1,yep. considering she won all the firewall primaries and was never in danger of losing the huge states. some email backbiting and debate scheduling would not have made sanders the nominee. 
1987,1991,1,he's a conservative but why does that make him an asshole?this way to see anyone with different opinions as the enemy is part of the problem imo.since his article in foreign policy december 2017 in which he describes how he always underestimated white male privilege and so on i actually kinda repect the guy.https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/27/2017-was-the-year-i-learned-about-my-white-privilege/
1988,1992,1,"the alt left has no actual policy goals, they just hate democrats and attacking them ""from the left"" gets the most hits and clicks. "
1989,1993,1,like what?
1990,1994,1,"yeah, i know it. part of the benefit of this place, and others like it, is being around people to help get through it all."
1991,1995,1,loool yeah uh huh he's gonna a win a free stay in a penitentiary in 2020 
1992,1996,1,"yea, legit same."
1993,1997,1,"hey, i get it, i was an organizer for her in virginia. i'm just sayin', i dunno how reputable *the root* is."
1994,1998,1,definitely. but it should be noteworthy when conservatives like her are now also pointing it out.

""i did like his tax bill though."" ""i used to be a liberal democrat but a few years ago i became conservative.""""liberals have shouted racism so much that it's lost its meaning and now people are more racist."" bla bla bla ""identity politics."" then he went on to say again that he doesn't like trump and how polarizing trump is and that when he and his wife were traveling internationally last year people would ask where they're from and he'd say american and they'd roll their eyes at him with ""ooh, *trump*"" and he that didn't make him feel good and was embarrassing. so he's conservative, used to be liberal just a couple years ago, and hates trump. but hates clinton more? i can't imagine what clinton did to make him ""never hillary,"" especially when he was liberal just a few years ago, but whatever it was, why not also be ""never trump"" if he's so aware to how awful and embarrassing trump is? i just don't get it.

2006,2010,1,"going into the future we need to be aware of the fact that people are individuals and that the only constant in this world is change. it seems that a major part of david's strategy is to get more persons of color to vote/be eligible to vote. ending the thought process there and just assuming that this will ensure a lasting majority is a mistake. i know if seems impossible to consider at this moment in time, but assuming that particular groups of people will vote the same way and at the same rates for all time is a mistake. there needs to be constant work to talk to as many people as possible. i was also surprised at the level of contradiction, or declaration of intent about gerrymandering in california. there is a good argument that california is too big and it's constituents would be better served if was broken apart. then david mentioned that his redrawing of the map would include 7 states that would have all voted for clinton by a good margin. that is pretty hard to do when california had about 200,000 less votes for trump than texas. to speak that another way, california has nearly as may trump voters as the entire state of texas. that is voter disenfranchisement on a massive scale.

2045,2049,1,"yeah that's a very one sided and unfair assessment.the facts are that all her major policy speeches were ignored by the media, which was entirely obsessed with the emails.i remember when she gave an excellent speech about mental healthcare and apart from one line in the nyt on page 7, it was entirely ignored by the media.https://www.vox.com/2017/12/7/16747712/study-media-2016-election-clintons-emailshttps://www.cjr.org/analysis/fake-news-media-election-trump.phphttp://www.womensmediacenter.com/news-features/harvard-study-documents-anti-clinton-media-biasdid sanders contribute to her loss? yeah you're damn right he did.when it was all too clear he had lost (after ny and especially after ca) he didnt concede but started to lie to his supporters he could still persuade the supers to vote his way, which was an outright lie.for over  1,5 months he continued to attack clinton and the dnc, all but preparing his supporters for the wikileaks dump days before the convention.by then his supporters had been convinced by sanders that the dnc had rigged the primaries against him (he used the same rhetoric as trump btw) and they were ripe for wikileaks to ratfuck the left.and afterwards? did he really campaign for hillary as he claimed?nope.i saw his hillary events: whenever he mentioned her name the crowds booed and he smiled, after which he diverted to his usual stump speeches.in the 3 months wikileaks started to dump the podesta mails, did he ever address his supporters and warn them his own campaign emails wouldnt have looked very much different?did he ever warn his supporters russia was playing them (while he now claims he knew?)?he's a bitter pos who wanted hillary to lose and who was planning his 2020 run instead of fighting trump.that doesnt mean hillary didnt make mistakes btw, her advertising and her general campaign relied too much on the old ways/ old methods, sure. but seeing how she still won by 3 million voted, im pretty sure a strong sanders support from after the ca primary would and could have made all the difference."

2102,2106,1,excuse me... don't put words in my mouth. this is exactly the problem with you berners... you resort to this condescension and arrogance when you don't find people agreeing with you. y'all are not progressive - wanting everyone to agree with you is not progressive... it's entitlement.  you guys would rather fight people on your side than work towards something... how are you different from trump people? it's really sad you can't see beyond yourselves.

2106,2110,1,misogyny and racism. and shamelessness.
2107,2111,1,"interesting perspective, but surely moderates could rally behind her. who would you think would be a better candidate?"
2108,2112,1,fake. 
2109,2113,1,"hillary delivered some pretty critical commentary towards the administration lately and she might be anticipating that her own security clearance will be revoked as a consequence, like former cia director (and frequent trump critic) john brennan's was. when that happened, it dominated the news cycle for awhile. plus, the president revoking security clearances because he disagrees with them politically is not something that was done before trump.my interpretation of this is that hillary would rather voluntarily give up her security clearance rather than having it *revoked* because 1) revocation would create a bigger news story, the press would rehash 2016, and more important issues would be ignored and 2) she doesn't want to take part in establishing this new precedent of the president revoking security clearances for people he doesn't like. she wants to limit the ability of trump to politicize the security clearance process."
2110,2114,1,you mean how leftist are trying to blame russians for the election? the hypocrisy of the left has no limit
2111,2115,1,/r/politics thread are all talking about how the trump supporters were laughing about this assertion...because we're apparently whitewashing anything the bernie fanbase has ever said on reddit.
2112,2116,1,thanks for the quick reply and the thoughts to mull over
2113,2117,1,you are correct.
2114,2118,1,"> (even clinton, had she edged this monster trump only with a slightly different distribution of voters / better roll of the dice, would still be obstructed by this same gop congress and gop state houses, only possibly facing a red wave during midterms right now.) i'll actually disagree here especially in terms of the red wave - yes she might have had the gop congress and senate but we all know she would have veto'd those tax cuts and not even allowed obamacare to be changed. and as for the red wave - i don't think that would have happened because this is where her experience would have come in to play. i love obama but his inexperience resulted in the dems losing the house but clinton as president would have been far more experienced and politically shrewd. she was already anticipating 2018 even during the campaign. she was already advocating for a lot of the candidates who are winning now.>one reason for that is a lot of people have grown disgusted with the limits of the status quo. one party found a way to validate that, the other wasn't in that position.we're not in power because of people being disgusted with status quo. if that was the case the gop wouldn't have won congress and senate in 2016. they kept power on the back of populist rhetoric. there was no validation here.no one stuck their heads in the sand. that's kind of false. democrats didn't pretend that everything was fine. they just engage that narrative on extreme rhetorics with false promises.the only ""elite out-out-touch complacency"" came from trump. i feel like this a huge misrepresentation of what happened and is a result of the dangerous populist politics at play.your message about moderation i agree with completely. but there's no moderate populism. we just have to hope the right kind of candidate replies to it - one who has tangible plans and policies to address populist concerns beyond grandstanding and rhetoric. there's no point in being in power if you can't do anything with that power. if aoc and other populist candidates get elected under trump and a gop government then what's the point of their ideology and rhetoric if they can't make anything happen? "
2115,2119,1,"yeah me too.i dont get it, what is wrong with people when the clinton's are involved?they're being attacked for 30+ years day in day out, but they're not allowed to defend themselves?"
2116,2120,1,she sat there and took questions from her enemies for hours. and donny t can't sit behind closed doors with mueller for 30 min.
2117,2121,1,"well that's ridiculous and frankly this kind of ""analysis"" is a call back to the ""vagina voters"" attacks leveled against her supporters during the elections. where and how exactly did you get the perception that her message was all about her gender unless all you looked at was ""i'm with her""? you're kind of reinforcing the sexism that was at play against her with this kind of argument because you didn't care to listen to her platform beyond her gender status. it's extremely disingenuous to attack her as hubristic when you're basing it on a clearly prejudiced basis. "
2118,2122,1,and the making a killing part is dangerous when you consider they wanted a horse race and so allowed all the overblown repetitive crap about her emails to dominate the headlines.  theyre literally fucking w the democratic process- making it impossible for anyone to lead the nation without ginned up controversy and division.  theyre still full of excuses for it too. 
2119,2123,1,"the issue this writer is addressing is violence against women.  she is pointing out statistics that women are largely harmed by men.  that is something that needs to be talked about more. we can't have men, or women if they were to be so inclined, responding with violence because they feel rejected by women. women have the right to say ""not interested"" without fearing being murdered. this writer never implies all men are to blame.unfortunately, most people will just look at the headline and not read further. i applaud this writer for her fearless stance. if it is only a ""left identity political"" issue then that is troubling."

2149,2153,1,"my friends are posting about how ""the dems have no message!"" and ""trump won because the dems had no message!"" and i'm just distraught. there were tons of messages! breaking down barriers package! why did so few people i know hear it..."
2150,2154,1,"**hillary clinton was exactly right about trump being putin's puppet**she tweeted, ""great world cup. question for president trump as he meets putin: do you know which team you play for?""cue the flame emoji for a serious political social media burn.regardless of whether clinton expected an answer to her tweeted question, she got one. the president of the united states clearly demonstrated to the world exactly which team he plays for: russia.""i have great confidence in my intelligence people, but i will tell you that president putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,"" trump said at a news conference with putin, regarding his belief that russia did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election.his message could not have been clearer: i trust what putin tells me, despite what the us intelligence community uncovers about russian election meddling.trump has been bashing the us intelligence community from day one of his presidency, famously labeling the russia investigations as a ""witch hunt,"" and very publicly feuding with the fbi.and trump continues to be dismissive of them even now, despite the comprehensive report by the cia, nsa, fbi and the office of the director of national intelligence, all concluding with ""high confidence"" that there was russian interference during the 2016 presidential campaign.it may seem that hillary clinton's tweet predicted a disappointing display of trump's allegiance to putin, but trump may just have fulfilled a prophecy that clinton made before he was even elected president.during the 2016 presidential campaign, clinton famously called out trump, implying that he would be putin's ""puppet.""""you encouraged espionage against our people. you are willing to spout the putin line, sign up for his wish list: break up nato, do whatever he wants to do,"" clinton said. ""you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race.""and she was right. trump's clear anti-nato remarks have generally aligned with russia's sentiment about the organization; his expressions of admiration for putin have played right into the russian leader's hand.and then came the fated trump-putin summit, and trump's failure to condemn russia for the coordinated cyberattacks during the 2016 presidential campaigns. this was particularly bold given that just last week, the justice department announced the indictments of 12 russian intelligence officials for interference in the election. trump has, once again, proven that clinton's prediction was spot on.heck, there's even a #shewarnedus hashtag on twitter documenting all the times hillary told us how the trump presidency would pretty much unfold from the get-go.with trump's track record, there was no reason to believe trump would not, once again, take russia's side.after today's press conference, democrats and republicans are both speaking out against trump's comments, with house speaker paul ryan stating that ""there is no question that russia interfered in our elections,"" and acknowledging the need to recognize that russia ""is not our ally.""john brennan, the former cia director labeled trump's comments ""nothing short of treasonous.""as members of both parties distance themselves from the president's comments on putin and are largely still absorbing the shock of having an american president openly side with and embrace a known adversary of his country, the one glaring truth we must all accept is that it was possible to see this coming. and hillary clinton did.after witnessing the summit, clinton herself had tweeted a response to her initial question: ""well, now we know,"" the tweet read.she knew all along which team trump would play on -- and by now we should, too. cool people read before commenting "

2185,2189,1,"i never said bernie was perfect. i'm a marxist for crying out loud. sanders is miles away from that.if the only difference between cortez and sanders is she supports identity politics and is better on abortion, than that still puts her ballparks closer to sanders than hillary. i even remember sanders supporting abortion completely anyways. if we want to play the merit game and base it off of their track record, then did you honestly believe hillary would be tough on the banks considering *her* track record? did you believe she would support gay marriage? same logic you're using to discredit sanders applies."

2201,2205,1,i'm not going to get back into arguments from the 2016 primary but you asked why people are still upset and i told you. if you don't see what they see then fine let's just leave it there.in regard to your second point: no. congress will not be fixing this. we are talking about the way the supreme court interprets the constitution. you can change that by changing the supreme court via presidential appointments or through constitutional amendment. if you're banking on an amendment to preserve the civil liberties that have been jeopardized by this presidency then you're a fool.this is a disaster that is going to take generations to undo. we are set back generations. i like ocasio-cortez. i really like her and am very happy to see her win that district. i want more people like her in congress. but that one seat is a drop in the bucket compared to what we are facing. it is not a solution or even a ray of hope.

2220,2224,1,"every single thing she warned us about before the election was true, so... >now we must do all we can to save our democracy and heal our body politic.>first, **weve got to mobilize massive turnout in the 2018 midterms.** there are fantastic candidates running all over the country, making their compelling cases every day about how theyll raise wages, bring down health-care costs, and fight for justice. if they win, theyll do great things for america. and we could finally see some congressional oversight of the white house.>when the dust settles, we have to do some serious housecleaning. after watergate, congress passed a whole slew of reforms in response to richard nixons abuses of power. after trump, were going to need a similar process. for example, trumps corruption should teach us that all **future candidates for president and presidents themselves should be required by law to release their tax returns. they also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules.**>**a main area of reform should be improving and protecting our elections**. the senate intelligence committee has made a series of bipartisan recommendations for how to better secure americas voting systems, including **paper ballot backups, vote audits, and better coordination among federal, state, and local authorities on cybersecurity.** thats a good start. congress should also repair the damage the supreme court did to the **voting rights act by restoring the full protections that voters need and deserve**, as well as the voting rights of americans who have served time in prison and paid their debt to society. we need **early voting and voting by mail in every state** in america, and automatic, **universal voter registration** so every citizen who is eligible to vote is able to vote. we need to **overturn citizens united and get secret money out of our politics**. and you wont be surprised to hear that i passionately believe its time to **abolish the electoral college**.>but even the best rules and regulations wont protect us if we dont find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and **rekindle our civic spirit**. there are concrete steps that would help, like greatly expanding national-service programs and bringing back civics education in our schools. we also need **systemic economic reforms** that reduce inequality and the unchecked power of corporations and give a strong voice to working families. and ultimately, healing our country will come down to each of us, as citizens and individuals, doing the worktrying to reach across divides of race, class, and politics and see through the eyes of people very different from ourselves. when we think about politics and judge our leaders, we cant just ask, am i better off than i was four years ago? we have to ask, are we better off? are we as a country better, stronger, and fairer? **democracy works only when we accept that were all in this together.**god damn, i miss her. she's right on in all of these suggestions.

2227,2231,1,i cant remember... did bernie go against hillary when she won the primary? or is it that he just didnt saying anything about backing her or not?
2228,2232,1,what would be the process? trump fires sessions and appoints someone whos new and not recused who fires mueller? or can trump directly fire mueller or rosenstein? it seems to me that sessions hasnt been fired because he must know something.

2233,2237,1,"wow this is some revisionism going on here.>give me one example of bernie sanders using sexism, and i support mueller's investigation but democrats can't just keep pointing at russia.""she isn't qualified to be president""bernie was never explicitly sexist but his surrogates and supporters were and he never did anything to dissuade that narrative.>all he ever talked about was policy. really? that's bullshit. most of his campaign against hillary was based on false smears about her ""speeches"". no basis or evidence for his allegations. that's not policy. when bernie talked about policy - e.g. the nydn interview, he fell short.when confronted with the smears he made against her, he had no answer.don't be revisionist especially in this sub. especially about hillary cause you clearly have no idea what she talked about. she engaged in actually policy conversation. he did not. we have debates and transcripts which prove that."
2234,2238,1,"violence is wrongviolence against women, men, or children. that is not an identity issue, and turning it into an identity issue by having a troll headline like ""blame men"" is just reprehensible. this just obfuscates the truth that, yes, there is a large pattern of male violence toward women in our society today. this may not be the writer's fault (i have worked as a journalist in the past, and headlines are usually not the writer's choice). in that case, the person i am really castigating is the editor who wrote the headline. reacting to the anti-immigrant identity politics of trump supporters, with another sort of identity politics is not going to work out for us."
2235,2239,1,"actually she won the popular vote in the 2008 primary but obama got 230 more super delegates.so the sequence is, ""win the popular vote but have a non-democratic entity give the win to someone else, run again, win both the popular vote and the non-democratic entity's vote on the second go round""."

"
2263,2267,1,"yeah we're completely on different planets and that's probably because you have a specific, misconstrued opinion of clinton:>it's a pretty powerful trend that the party opposite that of the president gains in midtermsyes the trend is that the opposite party gains the midterms but trends are not concrete. and that's my point - hillary knew even when she was running how important it was for down candidates to succeed. you might not agree based on your opinion of her, but she would have made it a priority to get dems back in power which is what obama failed at when he became president. she is just more politically astute.>and clinton's skills (even her most ardent supporters usually admit) weren't those suited to the bully pulpit and rallying public pressure. and this is completely false. you won't see any ardent supporters admit to this because it's completely false. there's a difference to being suited to the bullying pulpit vs getting attention from the media. i don't think you should misrepresent her skills by tying in her supporters. her supporters know better than anyone else what she can do. do you think a woman like her would have elected senator twice, run for the nomination in2008 when she lost by a 1% (she probably won the popular vote) and then run again and win handily if she didn't have the skills suited for the ""bully pulpit""? >let's face it, we'd be mid-impeachment trials right now.and this is where you betray yourself - what exactly what she be impeached about? this is the argument people used to dissuade independents not to vote for her but there's no basis. there's literally nothing that she could be impeached for.  this is the argument the far left uses as a justification for her not being in office which is ridiculous.>but despite her triangulation she'd be getting obstructed by the whole right as a communist, and from a much more unchastened left as a neoliberal. not a recipe for productive success.and again... you assume there would be this partisan politics at play. she might have got obstructed from the right but she could have also prevented all the destructive things trump and the right have enabled - tax cuts... obamacare under threat... chip... daca... muslim ban... the paris agreement. all of those things would have been prevented if she was president even with a gop congress and senate. and the only people on the left who would call her a neoliberal as a negative label (because these people only care about labels) are not in the government.either ways, liberal values and policies would be far more protected than they are now even if populist candidates like aoc win. cause they can win but how do they exactly hope to achieve their socialist rhetoric under a republican president whether it be trump or pence. they have no plan to achieve their ideologies. what's the point then?

2276,2280,1,"my career's in tech infrastructure and security (more infra than security, but i'm not ignorant), so that's where my perspective is focused here.would there be direct evidence?  in a well-run setup, possibly. depends on how good the hackers were.in almost any of these setups?  fuck no.  all the circumstantial evidence others are complaining about is *probably* the best the public's gonna get.  i can't speak to legal status, but in the tech world, the evidence michael harriot laid out in this piece is more than enough to answer the kinds of questions we tend to have.  those questions boil down to essentially one:given the available metadata (logs, audit trails, system monitoring histograms, diffs between backups and live data, etc), *can we trust that this system wasn't tampered with*?that question itself is generally made up of two smaller ones:  what *do* we know? and what *can* we know?  i almost started basically typing out the article in my own words, but i'll skip that part.  between how badly-secured these systems were (both design and implementation, and all the way from end-user to database backends), how badly audited and logged they were, and how badly backups were kept (if any), i think most competent professionals would generally agree on these points:* we know attackers gained access to live voting systems/databases* we know end-user voting machines are embarrassingly easy to gain access to.* due to bad security practices of many kinds, and in at least one case deliberate deletion of backups, *it is not possible* to verify whether or not data was changed in many of these cases.in the computer security world, if you can't verify something, being thorough means you must assume the worst-case scenario.  how you deal with it depends a lot on context but to stay focused: this means that we as technical professionals *must* assume rolls and votes were tampered with.the malfeasance and incompetence continually demonstrated over the course of the last two decades or so of modern electronic voting in the us has the general public in a position where anyone with a strong enough political lean can accept or dismiss the available data as they wish.  the pattern-matcher in me wants to think that's on purpose but that's neither here nor there.as an industry expert, the 'case' presented in this article is highly convincing.  ""can we trust that these systems were not tampered with?""  no, full stop.  will we ever have *direct* evidence that votes were changed? given the mismanagement involved, i very strongly doubt that.  is that enough for a legal case? i have no idea. if i were brought in to fix the situation? this is more than enough."

2280,2284,1,">i have not written any bill, how many has nixon written?she's worked on more than 0. she's been part of a number of education advocacy organizations where--again--she had actual _policy_ roles, not just fundraising. mostly at the city level, not state, but it's still dealing with appropriations in a multibillion dollar budget. that is comparable to state legislators who run for governor.>i hope to god you're not daring to compare an actress with no experience whatsoever to hillary who worked for the children's defence fund, worked to get major legislation passed before she ran for senator...i am claiming that she has experience. i'm not claiming she has as much experience as hillary did in 2000. the point is that you're making arbitrary standards. if she had done the same amount of work but received a government paycheck for it, you wouldn't be making ""no experience"" claims.[i like how you literally said ""i dont know much about politics in ny"" and then try to weigh in as if you're an expert on nys politics.](https://imgur.com/1mmibop) i too get pissy and double down when i make an incorrect assertion on a topic i know nothing about, and then other people call out my bullshit."
2281,2285,1,well of course - perfectly natural for human beings who are alive to want control over themselves.have you noticed how most people who make laws about abortion and maternal healthcare can't even give birth? your powers of observation are astute but ultimately useless.
2282,2286,1,she's running for congress.she should have a basic understanding of politics and economics.at the moment she doesnt and she makes incredibly stupid mistakes.
2283,2287,1,"well if he did get info from assange, it was good info, since wikileaks has 100% accuracy on info they publish.roger stone is awesome."

2287,2291,1,"oh wait, i remember you, you said i was ""sexist"" for making a joke about alexandria ocasio-cortez. ""the shameless way in which this family enriches itself (son gets 100k for picking his nose at the sanders institute, jane gave 500k to her daughter's woodworking school), his sexism and racism, his dangerous populist bs it takes a cultist's mentality to still support this fraud.""i'm not even going to address this, it's not worth addressing. let's agree to disagree :) "
2288,2292,1,it's bullshit. schumer has given trump leeway to appoint judges etc and barely did anything to make the senate races competitive. pelosi is not the one who should be under the microscope here.  under pelosi we've seen a record number of female representatives get elected in to congress. schumer has only worked towards preserving the old white man's club in the senate.
2289,2293,1,i'd be ok with her being held to the same standard as bernie.
2290,2294,1,not democrats! there are few democrats in there 40s or 50s who represents california who didnt support something as simple as legal weed in 2017-2018 its the most liberal state in the nation its not controversy to support that in california long long before 2018

2297,2301,1,is success really just cashing your dads checks? 
2298,2302,1,are you assuming that i voted for trump? because it sure sounds like you are.
2299,2303,1,trump/bernie talk.the term identity politics in itself is racist af.
2300,2304,1,"no, a huge part of the problem was also that a large number of people on the left *don't like her*. i know that this isn't the most popular place to say that, but it's the truth and i'm not going to deny it just because i like her. combine that with the fact that she invigorates the right and i don't know why anyone who wants to win in 2020 would want her as a candidate.

2386,2390,1,"i read all of these comments hours after the conversation happened and i absolutely think you're in the wrong. you weren't really listening to a word the other person is saying at all. you were just shutting down and saying that anything said to you was a personal attack against you.maybe i'm sucked into the mindset too much also, but just felt like letting you know, because it seemed like you hadn't caught on to why the conversation was happening in the first place."

2497,2502,1,what middle america might want to see is a candidate good enough to go on shark tank for a season and do a good job. the balance between the environment and the economy will probably never sway entirely towards a consumer advocate only. obama killed that route when he sat idly by and allowed millions of homeowners to circle the drain when their 10 year old heloc's reset and the payments doubled or tripled.

"
2502,2507,1,"i don't necessarily disagree, which is why i said i'd have to look at the specific merits.  however, i do think the people arguing for it are doing so somewhat reflexively, and that concerns me.  i.e., i don't think they've really thought it through. either way, as far as i know, there isn't an actual debate.  there's just a few people tossing it around that i don't take all that seriously."

2511,2516,1,"if you refuse to educate yourself that's up to you.however, since you show you know absolutely nothing about hillary:for lgtb, you can read this excellent twitter thread by long time lgtb activist lisa talmadge: it documents 30+ years of lgtb activism and solidarity from hillary:https://twitter.com/lisatalmadge/status/891714303438532608it shows how hillary was always there for us, how she worked behind the scenes, showed support for aids patients (which sanders never did), showed up in lgtb parades (which sanders never did) and how she worked to advance lgtb rights in her time as  sos.about poc:you can start by reading this excellent thread by mrweeks, documenting hillary's life long commitment to the cviil rights movement:the mods of this sub have written down the thread in this sub:https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/6n6mn7/brilliant_must_read_thread_by_mrdane_black/now i get it: you're one of those people who doesn't know anything about hillary's record. you fell for the far right's propaganda. but stating hillary defended the status quo, when in fact she was there for us for 30+ years or even worse: saying she wasn't a champion for women, makes you a first class asshole.and your pathetic: ""but i voted for her"", is about as genuine and dishonest as the average trump supporter.whether you support trump or bernie, i dont know, but frankly: it's impossible these days to keep those two groups apart."

2644,2650,1,"> if you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.i never said this. nobody actually ever says this. they say (something like) having white skin is a privilege.  that's different than legit thinking that all white men are privileged. i mean, obviously, we people in los angeles don't think this.  we see white homeless folks every day.  the right willfully misinterprets this, just like they did with black lives matter (too)... not (only) black lives matter.  to be honest, i'd like there to be a better word than 'privilege,' because it gets easily misinterpreted... but, then, when you have a massive machine trying to discredit liberals who want to get rid of the bigoted oppression of individuals based on what 'group' they belong to, any phrase you use will get twisted to be intentionally misunderstood.   ""sad to say but democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican.""  this is far from true.  most republicans voted for trump.  he is a fascist bigot who openly stated he wanted to ban all muslims from entering america.  you are engaging in a false equivalency.  ""its not about privilege, race or gender."" for people who are oppressed, daily, based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion?  yes, it is about that.  a poor black dude faces oppression that a poor white dude does not.  this doesn't mean a poor white dude has an easy life - that's not how existence works.  like, the fact that my skin color doesn't cause me to be oppressed... that doesn't mean my life is sunshine, roses, gold, and happiness. it's just that society does not oppress a poor white dude because of his whiteness. the greatest trick ever pulled was to oppress people based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion... and then, when folks try to fight back against identity-based oppression, yell that the folks pushing back against that evil are the ones engaging in divisive 'identity politics.'

2659,2665,1,speaking out against putin and his destruction of democracy doesn't make nance or anyone part of any 'pro war propaganda machine'. ironic since your comment comes off as brainwashed propaganda. if anything greenwald is the one proving to be a cog in putin's pro war propaganda by sticking up for an authoritarian who has no regard for the rights of his own citizens and props up dictators and corrupt oligarchs globally.

2680,2686,1,"those republicans never stop, do they?"
2681,2687,1,"oh fuck this idea that bernie shoved down people's throats that dems protected the status quo. bernie did nothing and didn't pass a bill his 16 years of being in senate. he can bitch about dems accomplishing nothing all he wants, but it's the dems that passed the most progressive bills to date. being economically stupid isn't going to help the united states progress forward. bernie is clueless at making policies that are economically realistic. it's why even california, our most left wing state, didn't vote for sanders or his version of single payer. he also agrees with trump's views on trade and tarrifs, something that could easily put us in another economic collapse.

2703,2709,1,this isn't an article for democrats. it's an article for bros and far left people. democrats have been raging since 2016. i mean the fact alone that the only reference in this article is michael moore interviewing steve bannon proves the demographic this article is aimed at.
2704,2710,1,gods but is handmaids tale a brutal sit. 
2705,2711,1,"so watching comey's appearance on the view - i'm glad someone brought up his hypocrisy of bringing up her emails vs not bringing up the ongoing russian investigation - listening to comey trying to justify not revealing the russian investigation, i just heard him throwing lynch and obama under the bus in his justification.  he specifically said about russia that they didn't ""know they had anything"" at that point but at the same time he didn't know he ""had anything"" with the emails they found on weiner's laptop (and eventually there was nothing) yet he felt the need to disclose that investigation and not the other.  his logic doesn't make sense and he seems to bring in obama as a scapegoat in this matter when he himself didn't apply the same standards to the hrc emails.  here's his interview on the view about the emails and the russian investigation:https://youtu.be/yrb1dpbaejw?t=27m55si want someone to ask him why he didn't wait to investigate the emails on weiner's laptop before releasing the statement... before knowing that there was something that was there."

2708,2714,1,"uhm the facts linked here show the exact opposite of what you just posted...maybe she didnt hold any rally in your area, is that how you're going to judge a candidate?do you think a large rally with 30k people would change anything in the narrative of her being accesible?i've seen many rallies of her where she (unlike any of the other candidates) spent time with people, spoke to people, listened to them and so on, but the presss didnt show any of this.develop relations with the reporters in her bus? she had reporters on her bus, trump called them scum and threatened them. but i guess hillary is to blame for the fact reporters were only interested in asking her why nobody liked her.."
2709,2715,1,"you really need to stop saying you voted for her. it doesn't give you any kind of credit when you folow up with your bullshit.\> youre not the first who has jumped down my throat for being a hillary\-voter but not a hillary\-fanatic.  who says you have to be a hillary fanatic? you definitely don't. but the stuff you've said clearly shows that either your very misinformed about her or you're intentionally trying to misrepresent her platform. you don't have to be a ""hillary fanatic"" to know that she's been fighting for women's rights pretty much all her life. or championed lgbt causes in a way no other secretary of state did. or fight for criminal justice reform for poc. you're certainly not a hillary fanatic but you also have no idea about her. so why did you vote for her?\> thats one of the things i didnt love about her campaign \- youre either with us, or against us! when exactly did this sentiment pop up? please point it out. from my recollection, it was only bernie and trump supporters who pushed this line of thinking. but pleae educate everyone here about the time hillary put forward this sentiment.fucking bullshit."
2710,2716,1,"lol. the ""modern"" gop? nothing modern about the gop targeting her. and if all they have is to target hillary then that shows how desperate they are cause that's they're only game play, even after 30 years.and by the way, she's talking about stuff that neither gop or dems are talking about.she definitely isn't causing any division ""all over"". at all. the only people with this view are the bernie bros and the right wing who are still threatened by her which only proves that she should keep speaking out."
2711,2717,1,"how do you know? with due respect, do you have access to his heart and mind?"
2712,2718,1,"if you need anyone to motivate you to not vote republican, you have a problem.i also find it hard to believe anyone called you racist or sexist without any kind of reason.anyway: the article was about misogyny and sexism among the far left.i find it telling you decided to attack without even addressing the content of the article.did you read it or did you just react because you dont like to discuss any difficult problem? you dont think the sexism many of us encountered by so called progressive white males is worth discussing?i would argue your race or sexe isnt the problem but your sense of entitlement is!"

2715,2721,1,you are beyond disgusting.
2716,2722,1,"well then why don't you specify what you're referring instead of seemingly moving the goalposts.""targeted tweets""? if trump keeps tweeting about her does she not have a right to speak up. targeted interviews? if people ask her about trump is she supposed to shut up? i mean no other president has targeted his opponent continuously years after the election the way trump has so there's also that.you are clearly threatened because her presence is obviously an issue for you and also the way you've skewed what she's doing.  and yeah i'm going to call you out because you're disingenuous."
2717,2723,1,there was only russians trying to help hitlary win not trump because he was not compromised like hitlary and we also find the chines meddle in the 2016 so learn the truth stop listening to false lies from clinton news network!

2736,2742,1,"again, you're purposely refusing to see my point. where did i say minimum wage helps white people more? please point that out. i'm clearly saying that bernie approaches it from one angle. he doesn't see that there are nuances affecting economic equality issues that concern race and gender. and to top it all, when he puts economic issues above social and civil rights issues, it's even more alienating to non-white voters. living wage is definitely important but if you're a minority, you're more concerned about getting the job or having the same opportunity for the job as everyone else. bernie's economics don't factor those issues. and if he cared so much about economic equality, then why hasn't he advocated more against voter suppression?he refuses to discuss race and gender in terms of economics when it obviously plays a huge part. that's why his agenda is narrow and wwc specific."
2737,2743,1,"there's excitement in places, usually for progressive candidates. otherwise, the message is ""vote in november to stop the republicans,"" and i don't see a plan for if this works, democrats gain control and out trump. then that leverage is gone and it leaves us where we've been for close to 20 years. i don't know how many people on here were around for the 2000 election, or 2004. those were dark times for liberals and i see us going back there.

2738,2744,1,">flash forward to march 2018, and im now hearing some of those very same bernie purists say that if the candidate has a d in front of their name, they will vote for them. even more interesting: they seem to be sincere about this new strategy, not resentful.well... better late than never i guess."
2739,2745,1,"r/politics has gotten better during 2017, i believe either users came across a revelation that hillary isn't that bad or democrats who supported hillary/don't think bernie is that great started commenting instead of lurking. there was a whole push to argue with bernie/third party supporters if their arguments and the decisions they made was all worth it. i see a lot less bernie supporters and more moderate democrats/casual commenters nowadays.but idk if it changed in 2018/late-2017 since i wasn't on there for a while.

2740,2746,1,"it's amazing people can still look at him as a ""progressive"" voice who can lead democrats. if anything, these midterms have been a repudiation not just to trump but also to bernie. all the shit he was spewing in the aftermath of 2016 about white working class voters and identity politics.... when congress elects a historical number of dem women and poc, that should say something to him and his supporters.

2798,2805,1,the careless destruction of the environment is also my biggest concern about the unchecked gop hold on wisconsin. people know walker for act 10 but forget that act 1 was his mining legislation. that was his #1 priority. the only thing that kept the penokee hills from being utterly devastated was the hold up from the federal government and somehow i don't think the current administration would stand in their way.  when i first came to wi for college i was so impressed by the environmental attitude of this state. the state of aldo leopoldo and gaylord nelson.

2824,2831,1,"#for those paywallednew data makes it clear: nonvoters handed trump the presidencyhttps://www.facebook.com/philip.bump5-7 minutesthen-republican presidential nominee donald trump shakes hands as he arrives at a campaign rally on aug. 30, 2016, in everett, wash. (evan vucci/associated press)most of our assessments of the electorate in 2016 are dependent on estimates. polling before the election that suggested where people were leaning; exit polling after the fact that gives us some sense of who actually turned out. when more than 137 million people vote, understanding exactly who they were and why they voted the way they did necessarily involves some guesswork.on thursday, though, pew research center released an unusually robust survey of the 2016 electorate. in addition to having asked people how they voted, pews team verified that they did, giving us a picture not only of the electorate but also of those who didnt vote. there are a number of interesting details that emerge from that research, including a breakdown of president trumps support that confirms much of his base has backed him enthusiastically since the republican primaries.the data also makes another point very clear: those who didnt vote are as responsible for the outcome of the election as those who did.as we noted shortly after the election, about 30 percent of americans were eligible to vote but decided not to, a higher percentage than the portion of the country who voted for either trump or his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. pews data shows that almost half of the nonvoters were nonwhite and two-thirds were under age 50. more than half of those who didnt vote earned less than $30,000 a year; more than half of those who did vote were over age 50.pews data allows us to see very specifically how voter turnout and candidate support compare. by looking at the preferred candidate in a demographic group and then comparing the density of that group in the population that voted with the density in the nonvoting population, we get a sense for how nonvoters determined the 2016 results.well start simply. women tended to prefer clinton to trump and made up a higher percentage of the voting population than the nonvoting population. that split alone helps explain clintons popular-vote victory.but women contains multitudes. black, working-class democratic women; white, wealthy republican women. the split by party shows how that makes a difference: republicans made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool and, unsurprisingly, broadly supported trump.(remember: were not comparing actual turnout to the pool of registered voters  were comparing percent of voters to percent of nonvoters. in a world where voting doesnt vary by demographic, the percent of voters from any group would be the same as that groups percentage of nonvoters. if a demographic group votes less than another, though, it will be below the centerline while the other group is above it.)looking at race and ethnicity, we see how the heavier turnout of white voters affected the contest. black and hispanic voters voted much more heavily democratic than white votes backed trump, but they turned out less.while half of nonvoters were white, 74 percent of voters were.an even more dramatic example of that comes when we look at age groups.people under 30 preferred clinton by 30 points but made up much more of the nonvoter population than the population that actually voted. a third of nonvoters were under 30; only 1 in 8 voters was in that age group.heres what the income divide in pews chart looks like.each of these demographic groups contains fragments of the others, of course. some of those earning under $30,000 in income are republican or black or female. if we overlap race and income, the dots above separate a bit.whites making more than $30,000 a year skewed republican and made up more of the voter pool than the nonvoter pool. poorer whites and nonwhites generally made up more of the nonvoter pool than the voter pool.income and education generally correlate, but the chart looking at education and race is remarkably different from the chart above. college graduates leaned toward clinton  but whites without college degrees voted heavily for trump. nonwhites without a college education were 40 percent of the nonvoter pool and only 1 in 5 actual voters.evangelicals were the most strongly pro-trump of the religious groups of voters, and they represented more of the voting pool than the nonvoting pool. black protestants and hispanic catholics made up less of the voting population than the nonvoting population  and strongly preferred clinton.if we step back and look at the bigger picture  all the demographic data points from pews analysis, including those above  the expected trend emerges.demographic groups that preferred trump were three times as likely to be a bigger part of the voter pool than nonvoters. among groups that preferred clinton, they were about 50 percent more likely to be a bigger part of the nonvoting community.clinton nonetheless won the popular vote. but an increased turnout of under-30 voters in, say, wisconsin, pennsylvania and michigan could easily have changed the results of the history."

2854,2862,1,first of all i want to make it clear. i was nd am super into hillary. i gave her more money than ive ever given a candidate. i made hundreds of phone calls for her. im not into bernie.cuomo has been fucking over nyc big time. hes also complicit with the big democratic machine thats making state government horrible. a lot of my pro hillary friends havent liked cuomo for years and support nixon. maybe more people from new york should chime in. on my facebook feed theres a lot of excitement around nixon and not a single positive mention of cuomo. 
2855,2863,1,"i'll go down the rabbit hole...no need for the question mark, none of those sources are right of center. i will say that fivethirtyeight and politifact are much closer than wapo. they also have much better track records for accuracy, but that doesn't mean what they cover and how they cover it is irrelevant. they do slant; all news orgs do. you just don't read anything except ones that are left leaning. also, you began your complaining in the hillary clinton sub, so echo-chamber is probably dead on. what opposition did you expect to find? who were you trying to convince?climate change- we both can cite numerous academics that agree with our positions, but there is still plenty of debate going on about the extent of our effect on the planet. [here] (https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/climate-change-no-its-not-97-percent-consensus-ian-tuttle/) is a right leaning website that explains a few skepticisms about how ""certain"" scientists are.furthermore, your original complaint expressed your discontent with republicans not voting to support the widely accepted views of climate change. however, the pew poll you referenced answered your own question it the numbers when it said, ""74% of republicans and independents who lean republican believe it is possible to cut regulations and protect the quality of air and water..."" i think sometimes reps get painted as not caring about the environment, which isn't true (according to this study). they just have a lot of confidence that there is another way to take care of the issue than target certain industries and jobs (coal specifically). gun control- the gallup poll you referenced was also comical. you are 100% right that the survey participants support stricter gun laws. where it gets funny is where they suggest what regulations would work and which ones wouldn't. all the suggested prevention methods that are widely considered effective are laws we already have on the books. the 3 at the bottom where a true divide starts to take place are laws that have been proposed by dems but never approved on a federal level. it would be logical to conclude that the gallup poll, taken only a month after the parkland shooting, might be emotionally driven. if everybody says more needs to be done, but then they only promote laws that already exists, it could just be honest-to-goodness frustration and sadness. not to mention the fact that only 42% of people reported owning a gun. everybody seems to have an opinion, but only 42% of them actually know what they are talking about. as far as the next few topics you brought up, i believe you told me to shut up, typed out childish sounds, and then became self-conscious about the aesthetics of your post. maybe you can forward that nonsense onto all the people who think like you do in this sub."

2871,2879,1,"i disagree. i think she's the most viable candidate. i know that's not the popular opinion but if you think it through it is. she has already gone through an election against trump and had *everything* thrown at her possible. they have nothing left to throw at her but rehash. and we know she's strong enough to take it and strong enough to weather republicans hating her and russia doing everything it can to take her down including trying to craft a narrative that everyone hates her, despite the fact she won more votes than donald trump and the second-most votes in u.s. history.what people aren't realising is that russia and the gop hate machine won't go away if hillary doesn't run again. they are priming for anyone who wins the dem nomination. biden, harris, duckworth, booker, sanders, whomever, once they're the dem nominee they will be just as hated and just as maligned online by an army of bots making it seem real and cool to hate them and the gop will make them the devil incarnate like they did hillary.this gop hate machine didn't even start with clinton. it started with obama, they made him the devil incarnate for the conservative base. but obama was lucky that russia didn't deploy all their evil plans to give the presidency to his opponent and now we are dealing with not only a deranged gop but a hostile foreign interference to tilt our elections.personally i feel clinton is the one most ready to go up against this army and win for 2020."
2872,2880,1,one can dream baby. one can dream! but after his name recognition last year i find it that will be very difficult.
2873,2881,1,i miss the good old bad old days of the 2016 campaign. i miss having hope.
2874,2882,1,"he's 100% right.when all this was going on, obama and holder vouched for comey and that is the only thing in the world that keeps me from hating the man. because otherwise this all looks plain as day as a guy who tried to take the easy way out instead of doing things the right way.  and as a result  this country is now off the rails.he's not to blame for everything that is going on but it would sure be nice to see him actually take responsibility for what he did."
2875,2883,1,"no, but it shouldnt be the litmus test. universal and properly accessible coverage can be achieved in other ways that are a better fit for the established american healthcare system."
2876,2884,1,[study here](https://eml.berkeley.edu/ygorodni/brexit_election.pdf).
2877,2885,1,"ugh. these people are such dummies. first off, woodward has written at least 4 books, that i know of, on democrats, but second, there, quite simply, has been more corrupt republicans to write about! they're just in denial."
2878,2886,1,"im a white male.  (hopefully that first statement doesnt make your ears burn but i cant help it if it does.) in 2016 and early 2017 attended my county, my state and the national democratic convention.  i cant count how many times a hillary supporter implied or flat out called me racist or sexist without even knowing me at these events.  this mentality came from the national campaign and if it turned a liberal white male like myself off i can only imagine how it emboldened a fox news watching white male conservative.  white men will live in the us for the foreseeable future and make up a significant part of the electorate.  democratic campaigns have to learn how to reach out to them and at the very least not piss them off so they have motivation to vote for a republican."
2879,2887,1,this is pretty much true also white people too
2880,2888,1,"that poor white man still started out with an advantage over women/poc. it's interesting you're actually the only one that looks at everything through the lense of race.and i didnt witness you vote, but i reacted to what you posted here. your entitlement has nothing to do with race, but with...the entitlement that shines through everything you post here. democrats need to understand the issues facing white men to win elections...really?democrats need to learn how to reach out to white men?really?you sound like a pathetic relic who desperately still wants to be the center of everything.how about you stop looking at everything through the lense of your privileged white skin and become a human being? "
2881,2889,1,"that was my exact thought.  ""whose next?"" i mean, if trump had his way hillary... "
2882,2890,1,"or anything that takes it into account...heck, try a multi component statistical analysis with residuals from a predictive model. please tell me studies are being done."

2892,2900,1,that was the last time there was hope for this country.
2893,2901,1,"that is the magical and tremendous power of sexism. sexism is americans' secret religion, secret even to its adherents."
2894,2902,1,"countless factors contributed to hillarys loss, but i think that the #1 reason is misogyny and i will always stand by that statement. female politicians are always much more distrusted than their male counterparts. even in the republican primaries, there was a poll where carly fiorina was voted to be the least trustworthy candidate, even though she was relatively new to the political arena compared to candidates like cruz."
2895,2903,1,they are going to be so mad when clinton is elected president in 2020.
2896,2904,1,because it hasn't.nice try though.
2897,2905,1,"ah ok.no, i have no idea if hfa had one.:(cant find it when i google it either."
2898,2906,1,"fair. but perhaps we should take it seriously. its fairly easy. one can summarize what exactly you do to abolish it in two sentences based on reverse engineering the homeland security act of 2002restore the investigative and intelligence resources of the us custom service. partially reconstitute the immigration and naturalization services in the form of its, criminal investigative, detention and deportation resources. there. you abolished ice. the bureaucratic transition would be smooth because we already know how it worked before, and now you split the overly broad powers and massive budget of ice into two separate much easier to reign in parts. "
2899,2907,1,"but remember guys, a woman wouldn't have the temperament needed to be president "
2900,2908,1,i have avoided the news the last few days because i knew it was inevitable that the lying piece of shit would be confirmed to the scotus. sent some emails to ron johnson's office that were probably laughed at if read at all. time to get back to work to elect dems up and down the ticket in november.

2904,2912,1,"and that sanders had dump over $15 million into their own social media messaging firm revolution messaging by the time clinton spent $1 million.yet everyone claims $1m bought millions of paid shills on reddit despite the fact that multiple anti clinton articles were on the front page all throughout the primaries, through the summer and even a little after the convention.  but sure sander's had a purely grassroots following online, no shilling or message manipulation with the $25 million+ spent by the end and having active mods in r/s4p."
2905,2913,1,ago often plays into political stance. after being in power so long and then getting older you get more and more stuck in your ways of thinking.  
2906,2914,1,i'd be wary accepting this as fact. it's easy to make a paid actor post on craigslist and i would say that this is likely someone's attempt to created a conspiracy where none exists.
2907,2915,1,and the people he spills the beans on. 
2908,2916,1,"you guys should see the moron the ct gop nominated for governor this year. bob stefanowski actually wants to eliminate the income tax, blowing a 10 billion dollar hole in our already huge deficit. "
2909,2917,1,the primary was rigged lol....that fact is accepted by everyone. 
2910,2918,1,"interesting analogy, but both are designed to brainwash children. if i had kids, there is no way in hell, i would ever send them to a fundie school. those schools work in reverse, they close the mind instead of opening it. "
2911,2919,1,"really? i thought her five million more votes won the primary from bernie, boy was i wrong this whole time "
2912,2920,1,[hillary thought the plan was ok in 2014](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/06/18/hillary-minors-crossing-border-must-be-sent-home/?utm_term=.a6846ffc9268) 
2913,2921,1,"about that last remark: ofc not. most here have suffered two years of sexist abuse by what has become known as berniebros.you should see the private messages i still receive from /s4p regularsbut if there's sexism among a certain type of young white male progressives you're not going to change that by presenting some female candidates, but by discussing it.if i were to receive a dollar for every time some bernie supporter tweeted at me 'identity doesnt matter' when i tried to campaign for sharice davids, i'd be rich by now.it isnt identity politics to believe representation matters or to think that fighting the patriarchy should be an important progressive issue.i literally never see anyone dsa related speak about women's rights or feminism, do you?and fyi: i dont think these boys are sexist because theyre dsa, i think its just that being sexist is considered cool among a certain type of bros (chapo traphouse comes to mind).and finally: the boys i describe (cant call them men, theyre way too immature for that) arent really left or progressive at all.they want free weed, free college and whatever else bernie embraces."
2914,2922,1,"great point. he seems to become more brazen as time progresses and may get us into a situation we can't easily get out of, but i assumed pence would okay a d would progress the conservative's agenda with the help of republican house. "
2915,2923,1,"i just saw a writer on morning joe talking about how western civilization has lost 'gratitude' bc we do not realize how far humankind has come...e.g. poverty metrics over the last 30 years, etc.i want to agree. but i have noticed an uptick of this kind of thinking, and i feel like it is a response or reaction to something .... about womens rights, india's current violence against girls and women problem, environmental protection, etc. the typical response is ""look how far we've come though"".any one else know what i am talking about? am i in the wrong place to ponder this?"
2916,2924,1,">it is kind of offensive that someone would suggest the more progressive democrats are a wedge that can be used to peel off some more support for this republican party.true, but at the same time, it doesn't do any good to be so close-minded in local govt. tbh, i hate it when local govt candidates even label themselves as rep or dem unless it's just for political sway....which is the whole reason for campaigning. but still, sometimes local govts get really bloated or get pigeonholed for no other reason than being a certain label. for example, in india there are different political groups per state sometimes even city. it seems more specialized to me for local issues which is nice."
2917,2925,1,bernie is still held to a higher standard than republicans. i think most people were aware that bernie's plans were mostly aspirational.
2918,2926,1,obama started to lose the white vote the day he spoke about trayvon martin's death.look at the polls.the trend has nothing to do with clinton.and your denial of structural racism and white privilege is pretty pathetic.yeah trump had a miserable live
2919,2927,1,this is pretty incorrect. trump never ran on the idea of home loans getting repaired or any other offer about those who lost their homes 10 years ago...right now (august 2018) the republicans are not running on anything for the mid-terms near the idea of offering home loan banking corrections. trump hasn't lost one person in his original base because of this. trump ran on and won because of racism other white people saw clinton as an extension or 4(8) more years of obama and they did not want it. there is no such thing as economic anxiety 
2920,2928,1,obama was hosting like 7 wars and droning the shit out of children and still could make time to welcome all his favourite gangsters to the white house. 
2921,2929,1,"i really don't think she would win if she ran again. if anything her running would energize the right all over again when that's the opposite of what you guys need, and she'd further divide the left. the right is too well versed on how to attack her and how to hit hard, it'd be better to have a candidate whose fairly unknown and can't be smeared through the mud as much and turn off moderates or people who are wishy-washy about the whole thing. historical precedence is not something to gamble four more years of trump against. "
2922,2930,1,"i do not agree with mccain on many issues, and i do not condone many of his actions in the past, such as his use of derogatory terms toward asians (though he supposedly apologized for this during his primaries so i guess i forgive him).but the reactions to his death from the far left and the far right are really screwed up. on one hand i see trump supporters with their ""burn in hell"" comments, and on the other i see people on my facebook feed (who supported jill stein election) talking about how it's okay to celebrate his death"

2924,2932,1,"he unifies the hateful, the fearful, the racist."
2925,2933,1,theyre most in denial because it destroys the narrative that hillary lost because shes a bad candidate. also some of sanders campaign managers ties to russia and sanders voting records being exposed also may lead to something.
2926,2934,1,"no, no, no no!!!!!!"
2927,2935,1,"yeah, me too.  i went to another state to go meet her, so..."
2928,2936,1,"we need collins and mursurski on board to ensure the nominee will not strike down rowe v wade.  i think mccaine should get right w god by blocking the pick too- he interested to do it to hrc, and should regret doing hat for the party of trump. "

2931,2939,1,the split had already happened by the time the 2016 election rolled around.  trump just amplified the split.
2932,2940,1,or what? lol
2933,2941,1,yup. its entirely possible to be very critical of comey and still know what trump did was wrong.
2934,2942,1,"it was yes/no. ""do you personally hope that the united states elects a woman president of the united states in your lifetime, or not?"" https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/a849k68e2i/econtabreport.pdf"
2935,2943,1,"you need to interview more than 430 though to be able to draw valid conclusions about an entire subsection of society. especially when that conclusion is condensed to 'trump voters say white men are discriminated against more than women, gays, minorities'. a more genuine title would read 18% of 430 republican voters believe that men are discriminated against more than etc because if you look at the survey it doesn't mention white men, just men. lets not get into the sub title of the article either which states that 'nearly half of trump voters said men face either a great deal or a fair amount of discrimination in america today.' with about 63 million people who voted for trump the article is claiming that 31.5 million+ people believe men are discriminated against more, when the reality is that 160 people think that is the case."
2936,2944,1,"stupid shit, usually."
2937,2945,1,"awesome! glad to hear that. we need every vote we can get. would your sister be interested in helping out with the campaign? we have canvassing, phone banking, and a postcard project. "

2940,2948,1,"are you for fucking real? just because there are democrats who don't support a socialist candidate, they're republicans? people like you are the problem because you only operate in the extremes. i mean even your comparison to reagan's time is so off-base. the democrats are so much more to left  than they were then and nothing comparable to reagan's cons.every thing you are saying is completely off-point. modern democrats who are centrists are anything but republican. i mean, your rational is completely absurd because you think being centrist is as bad as being a modern day republican? are you fucking serious?'you've laid out issues that democrats have been fighting for and made actual ground on before far leftists decided they wanted to burn down all the progress.your outrage is not only false but also insulting because you've completely ignored all the progress that liberal democrats have made in a conservative government... that's the power of centrists. whereas far leftists have never achieved anything.you want to talk about pulling back to the left... since 2008 we've pulled to the left tremendously and we could have done more so if hillary was elected. so how are the centrists the bad guys here?the way i see it, someone like bernie who's ""leftist"" has achieved nothing in his entire career. just a bunch of hot air.  whereas real leaders who have been more centrist have done way more.if you can tell us how far left politicians have actually enacted liberal change more than ""centrist"" politicians, please go ahead."

2945,2953,1,good take 
2946,2954,1,she literally blamed everyone for her loss in 2016 maybe she should realise she lost because she was a terrible candidate that deleted thousands of government emails illegaly and stop by her husband while he was accused by credible rape accusations and she was also a loser and not even liberals went out to vote for her
2947,2955,1,i dont know whether to laugh or cry at this tweet 
2948,2956,1,"they removed it because it's a known like that every time people accuse of agent orange being a puppet of putin, his supporters bring it up.hell even fox news said it was a lie.this has been stated so many times, and that's why the person wasn't asking any question,they just want led to bring in lie to show that it's hillary who supposedly bought by russians.even though nobody sold uranium to russia and hillary wasn't even involved in that deal whatsoever."
2949,2957,1,care to expound on that opinion? also gotta say its pretty weird you say that in the hillary clinton subreddit 
2950,2958,1,"i just want to make my hatred of sanders known. i went from really liking him in 2015 to realizing his ""policies"" were just nice ideas from an old hippie that could never really come to fruition, at least not how he ""planned"" to go about it , and his ""plans"" were vague at best. whereas hillary, ever the policy wonk, laid out how she would do x\-y\-z. but no one wants to hear that democracy is slow for a reason and that certain steps must be taken. "
2951,2959,1,"oh really?so that one time mrs privileged left her 9 million dollar mansion to pose for the cameras constitutes doing more than the endless hours of canvassing, demonstrating, phonebanking, attending rallies and meetings most of us here do?i dont think so bud, i think youre sitting on your lazy ass and are projecting"
2952,2960,1,god forbid we let women have their own choice 
2953,2961,1,"everytime i see the phrase ""identity politics"" i replace it with ""civil rights.""generally makes the point much clearer."
2954,2962,1,pure class..  if i were in her position i would take the no fucks given approach and just go completely unfiltered on twitter.  guess thats the difference between someone as successful as hrc and me lol
2955,2963,1,"important, but it won't matter to republicans.https://twitter.com/senatorleahy/status/1037357537006379009"
2956,2964,1,don't equate bernie to the left when he's dismissing identity politics as a non issue. cortes does not. she embraces identity politics. bernie only cares about wwc so he's not a progressive.
2957,2965,1,how do you feel about the masses of people who sat out the election? is that clinton's fault? 
2958,2966,1,it all depends on the media imo.how long will they allow him to get away with his none stop lying?
2959,2967,1,hopefully the mods leave it up so people can see what an ass you are.
2960,2968,1,i love how there is room for different viewpoints on this sub! #onwardtogether
2961,2969,1,also gave us gwb
2962,2970,1,what a steaming pile of horseshit.
2963,2971,1,"he was all over the place during the election, and suddenly his account is basically not even interested in politics hardly anywhere near what he was during the election. weird. activity is way down in general, too."
2964,2972,1,"um, i'm pretty sure there were dems who just didn't vote as well. i called hundreds of dems and they were not very eager....kept saying they would vote but probably didnt. people didnt like white women, not even other white women!"
2965,2973,1,"i don't understand how can you support bernie and then switch to trump, when hillary had as progressive platform as bernie had.just goes to show that people are not voting for what politicians are offering but for their name and how loud they can talk and how much they can lie.absolutely disgusting and terrible from this guy."
2966,2974,1,"also, donald trump is held to a different standard. i've heard that one called the dancing-bear standard, as in ""you see a bear doing something that kinda-sorta looks like a dance, you say, 'oh look, a dancing bear'. nobody ever says 'that bear's a lousy dancer'."""
2967,2975,1,she wouldn't buddy around with him.
2968,2976,1,and bernie destroyed our lives by asking his cult members to vote for trump.  now our lives are shit because of bernie.  he is a man of hate.  man of hate.
2969,2977,1,https://mobile.twitter.com/maddow/status/990281550678896641
2970,2978,1,"hillary clinton and barack obama are larger than life figures to millions of people in this country. they represent that to any person, regardless of gender or ethnicity, that even they can wake up and be anything in this country. as they both are no longer candidates or public servants in any role, there is only one acceptable way to refer to them: with admiration and respect for the barriers they have broken, for the millions of people they inspired, and for the work they did to make this country a much better place. the time to critique them is long gone, and any criticism or attack is an attack on women and minorities (they overlapping coalitions they created), and will never be forgotten."
2971,2979,1,"trump knew the russian's were already hacking hillary's campaign, thankfully his arrogance betrayed him and he could help but brag about iti hope this is just one of the items used for impeachment"
2972,2980,1,he's a hero.
2973,2981,1,"so what you're saying is, you don't actually have the slightest fucking clue what you're talking about?"
2974,2982,1,hm
2975,2983,1,if she kneecaps bernie than im all for it.
2976,2984,1,i'm a far leftist progressive but i fucking love hillary. i'm one progressive that like to say i'm sorry for doubting you. i voted for you and campaign for you but didn't put in my 100% and never spoke up for you when other progressives were trashing you. we fucked up ....big time. 
2977,2985,1,it was a conversation and she brought up how in her past it was okay. still no need to apologize for having a conversation about it.
2978,2986,1,"to be fair, this is literally a hillary clinton subreddit talking about bernie."
2979,2987,1,"it was a subreddit. i don't remember which one exactly. but they keep harping on how important it is that we elect a woman for president, and how anyone who favors a male candidate over a female one is doing a misogyny, whether they mean to or not."

"
2984,2992,1,"if hillary should run again, let me advise her to confront this issue head on. hold some forums in west texas of west virginia with people who think youre the devil. have the conversation!!  she doesnt need to convince everyone but surely needs to win over a few points in pa, wi, fl, & oh. its ironic that obama radicalized many of these voters which is why they wouldnt give her a chance this time, unlike in 2008. "
2985,2993,1,"how did hillary cause russia scandal? i mean i get that she didn't, but what's their story that they pretend she did? if i was inventing fake news, still not thinking of any ways to do this."
2986,2994,1,"he also seemed like a really nice person.  and of course, there was that vote last july, the deciding vote, and he would often defend obama to people who heckled him during the presidential campaign against each other."

3042,3050,1,yea i agree

3086,3094,1,people have to vote. also there's a possibility that  antifa people may be paid by trumptards to stir up crowds. their faces are always covered.don't be so quick to support them. 
3087,3095,1,which parts are incorrect? i would be more than happy to explain and elaborate on my points.
3088,3096,1,it's easy to vote against conservative policies which are not in line with how most americans feel.
3089,3097,1,"tack-on 1:    in related news, it *seems like* i've been seeing a lot more of ""this is why trump won,"" and ""liberals think everyone is a nazi,"" and ""give me something to vote *for,""* and ""hillary clinton can't be trusted"" than normal, but i could just be imagining things.  confirmation bias is universal, y' know?  so i decided to check it out.  this synopsis is courtesy of hamilton 68:    >*[the #walkaway movement, a campaign highlighting alleged discord among the left, got a boost this week from accounts linked to russian influence operations. the first use of the #walkaway hashtag from accounts monitored on hamilton 68 was noted in early june (a few weeks after the grassroots campaign began), but engagement remained relatively low throughout the month. activity spiked on july 2, when hamilton 68 noted 73 unique tweets using #walkaway, and roughly another 50 using related campaign hashtags (e.g. #walkawaymovement). the late engagement suggests kremlin-oriented accounts are trailers rather than leaders of the campaign, but the high-level of current engagement indicates an effort to astroturf support for the movement and hijack the narrative. this includes several monitored accounts that have changed their handles to include the hashtag, or that have shared their own supposed walkaway moments. the campaign also received a direct boost from russian propaganda outlets rt and sputnik, both of which ran stories on the movement.](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/)*     keep your eyes out for attempts to divide our movement, and our party, in ways both blatant and subtle.  *we lost the 2016 by 80,000 votes,* less than a football stadium, we can't afford to be at anything less than full strength this year.  a moment's foray into r/walkaway should tell the average user everything they need to know about the movement.  if you see someone using walkaway talking points around social media, take the time to disarm them.  i'm still hearing people talking about the ""rigged primaries,"" a talking point that was [disproven](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/14/16640082/donna-brazile-warren-bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-rigged), so either russia is playing its greatest hits, or people still believe it, or both.    our enemies will be pushing back at us just as hard as they did in 2016, and if they're smart they'll push back *even harder* now that they have an entire political party on their side, but we know what we're looking for, and how to defend against it.  call the bullshit, bullshit, and make sure everybody knows it's bullshit."
3090,3098,1,that's awesome.
3091,3099,1,"what i think will happen: democrats take house in 2018. in 2020 republicans will ride democrats on not getting anything done while having the house. democrats win presidency, loses house, but gets senate back. "
3092,3100,1,not to mention what cruz and rubio did in the primaries is worthless now that they've become such suckups.

3128,3136,1,are these the pizza parlor sex ring in the basement people?
3129,3137,1,i'm still with her.
3130,3138,1,"> every single citizen of the united states has identical rights, regardless of skin color. how can rights be more equal?? the fact that you believe this and don't want to talk about race makes sense. your definition of racism also misses the mark. since you're really quite oblivious about the lack of equal rights - a white man in texas won't get asked for papers but a brown man will. also the criminal justice system is extremely biased against poc compared to white people. there are plenty more."
3131,3139,1,"while i'm certainly against abolishing ice completely, i do think that their powers should be scaled back, and if a democrat wins in 2020, they should clean house at the agency. perhaps some of ice's current funding could be used to upgrade border security and better equip and train border patrol agents instead, and it's not going to be exactly a good luck for republicans if they oppose border security. i'd also like to note that ice has only been around since 2003, so it's not like it's something we've been dependent on forever."
3132,3140,1,"the guy is going ""well, if we're going to be like that, let's go full blast with originalism."" ignoring that it was just male property owners, not just white.hell, the first slave owner in america who lobbied congress hard enough to pass laws allowing cattle slaver was a black man."

3134,3142,1,they're all talk. they would have never been able to impeach her. that was another talking point that far left and independents bought in to.

3137,3145,1,it probably would have gotten the same coverage as all the other times it's a white male with a gun do. 
3138,3146,1,"trump's popularity is the result of the cult of personality he's built around himself. for proof, i offer ross perot, who was *exactly* the ""a plainspoken and amusing right-wing...outsider"" you say people wanted, although he wasn't a nationalist. he maxed out at 19%."

3191,3199,1,she's not the only woman who's been killed by a man for refusing his sexual advances lately.  it's just the one getting the press because he was an immigrant. 
3192,3200,1,thats disappointing. the daily storm is usually known for its journalistic integrity./s
3193,3201,1,"you claimed she has ""no experience whatsoever"", which is untrue except for ridiculous standards of experience.i think it's fair to say that she is _less_ experienced than other potential candidates. she's certainly less experienced than cuomo, who's had the job for almost eight years. but that's hardly the same thing as no experience; a governor works in advocacy, policy, and management. she's had decades of experience and is well respected in each of those areas. the most relevant attack you can use against her is lack of _breadth_ of experience, rather than depth, because until her candidacy she's been mostly laser focused on education policy. even so, that's true to an extent of any candidate, cuomo included. nobody is an expert in every field."
3194,3202,1,didn't stone basically say publicly that he was working with guccifer 2.0 to have them released?
3195,3203,1,nope. i truly hope you can get over your mental issues and become a productive member of society.
3196,3204,1,"i hear this every election. this is the one dems are going to slaughter them. then comes the election and dems never come close to expectations. other than a massive financial crisis (2008)dems get their asses kicked. they need to prove republicans are fixing elections with the russians or the electronic voting machine hacking, or they need to re-evaluate what they are doing to get voters. i don't believe for one second the republicans/russians lose either house this fall.

3203,3211,1,sounds good - would be good info to post on here in general.
3204,3212,1,whether you like it or not. strong leadership is tied to anti-trump. don't even see how you can say otherwise. keith ellison? he's been 2nd in command of the dnc for 2 years and done nothing to curb the division. ro khanna? novice. jayapa? novice. what credible leadership have these people shown? 
3205,3213,1,"just got back from a weekend campaigning for his opponent, andy kim. would be a huge victory in nj."
3206,3214,1,"fuck bernie sanders. ""oh, hillary has to earn my vote. oh, you guys have to kiss the ring. oh, bernie is sooooo different and progressive. oh, bernie is my hero."" gtfo, you guys sound just like trump supporters. it's been two years, and you still don't get it..... unbelievable."
3207,3215,1,"seriously? sanders endorsed and campaigned with hillary...in regards to your second sentence, isn't that the point of electing a new congress? we need people like alexandria to prevent those."
3208,3216,1,"ah, i meant where did he disavow trump. i 100% believe he was full of multiple kinds of hate. which makes it hard to believe that he disliked trump."
3209,3217,1,hillary has no fucks to give. and why should she? 
3210,3218,1,"has anyone else noticed that somehow republicans have the less popular opinion of every issue but they still are in power. most americans want something to do about climate change. most americans want gun regulation, and not basic stuff either, some pretty far reaching goals like gun safe inspections. most americans want reproductive rightsmost americans want gay people to be marriedall of these gop is against, yet they control the entire federal government and like 2/3 of state governments "

3288,3297,1,i love that she's taking on this kind of project - shining a light on the history of women's struggle for equal rights and also civil liberties as a whole. in a way i see it as a kind of response to a generational issue about women's rights and civil liberties that came up during the primaries but was largely ignored after - the importance of recognizing struggles of the activists who have allowed us to have so many of our modern civil liberties. i feel it's a perspective that many younger liberals/progressives need to remember/be educated about.

3487,3497,1,"he should run as a republican, but he's too anti-trump to win their nomination."
3488,3498,1,"somehow this statistic is being bungled. i would suggest hillary clinton won the 30,000 and less vote by a landslide but then lost the 30,000 to 50,000 dollar range voter by a smaller amount. barack obama did not offer any kind of a safety net for homeowners who took out a heloc and watched it reset after 10 years, from 2014 to 2016. when the payment reset it doubled or tripled. homeowners needed to be able to get a replacement heloc and it was not offered so many were forced to sell their home. unfortunately for hillary clinton, her quid pro quo deal with barack obama which was to say nothing negative about either sanders or obama's time as president backfired as she lost moderate votes to trump. obama helped hillary clinton get back progressive votes lost to bernie sanders, but every moderate vote that hillary clinton lost to trump was like a two vote swing, whereas every vote that obama got back for hillary clinton was worth only one vote."

3496,3506,1,"i agree in some respects. if its a like west virginia or north dakota, where manchin and heitkamp are democrats in general red states, i dont have a problem with it. theyre doing their best because a conservative democrat is better than almost any republican in those terms. but if its someone in california or hawaii, i wouldnt be okay with it. because thosestates have shown themselves to be overwhelmingly liberal to the point where id wonder why you opposed a certain thing."
3497,3507,1,"what else are they going to attack her on? no one divided the left, and helped legitimize trump more than bernie. the gop/trump hit machine will attack anyone that wins the nomination, and will use that to energize voters. listen, i would like to see someone like kamala harris and chris murphy (or even beto) win the primary, but im not going to tell hillary clinton to take a damn seat. especially if bernie and biden run.

3525,3535,1,"yes! i would love her as president. she's a fighter who will strongly advocate for progressive positions. she and bernie are strong allies too. overall, this would be great for democrats, as it unites the progressive wing and the moderate wing. better to have warren than cuomo or booker"
3526,3536,1,why ? is it because he is a straight white conservative male sitting on the supreme court ?
3527,3537,1,but why shouldn't she act that way since she's earned it?
3528,3538,1,his opting for appeals to ideals rather than the predictable consequences of his actions is pretty damning.  i think this is the wrong time to be focusing on this given that we've known pretty much all of this for over a year but there are a lot of comey quotes that really do vindicate hrc's and her supporters' beliefs about how that went down.  
3529,3539,1,"yeah, i didn't really pay attention to politics until about halfway through the bush years.  i like bill and i just looked up her record when it became clear she was the likely nominee and came away with ""she's not perfect, and the two have a weird penchant for relatively benign cutting of corners - but, ultimately, they've spent the lat 30 years in public service and have accomplished more than 99.9% of people could ever dream of to help others.""also, i don't really care that she pals around with wealthy people.  she's been in high-level government for 30 years.  you think she's going to hang out at applebee's just to get a sense of average folk?"
3530,3540,1,"kamala harris was "" saving democracy"" when she failed to prosecute mnuchin and his corrupt banking practices?uhhhhhh....ok...."
3531,3541,1,the supporters of jim jones did the same thing. cults are like that
3532,3542,1,then the war on drugs set that plan back 4 decades.
3533,3543,1,"it wasn't her ""turn"". she was just the most qualified. period. this kind of thinking doesn't reflect what she stood for or why people voted for her. "
3534,3544,1,why
3535,3545,1,"i saw a phrase that describes trump's policies. it's called sado-populism. basically, trump supporters like him because he's sticking it to the people they hate, liberals, women, ethnic minorities, immigrants, ect. he pretended to be a populist, but they really like him for being mean. i don't know if they will ever realize, they're getting fucked over. "
3536,3546,1,"yeah that's the worst part. i think she's probably one of the most qualified candidates we've ever had, but the gop has built such an insane disinformation campaign against her that it seems impossible to overcome. i know smart people who hate trump but still think she's ""so corrupt "". when i ask them specifically why they can't come up with a single reason."
3537,3547,1,he's a conservative but why does that make him an asshole?this way to see anyone with different opinions as the enemy is part of the problem imo.since his article in foreign policy december 2017 in which he describes how he always underestimated white male privilege and so on i actually kinda repect the guy.https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/27/2017-was-the-year-i-learned-about-my-white-privilege/
3538,3548,1,"trump's committed a lot of impeachable offenses.  the question is, will this be the one that finally does it?"
3539,3549,1,we already have secure borders. you've drunk the kool-aid. well done.
3540,3550,1,so depressed. so so depressed. everything hillary predicted came true now. if only all those who were not happy that hillary was not progressive enough foresaw what the alternative was. 
3541,3551,1,trumps pick will become kennedys legacy
3542,3552,1,"i voted for hillary in 2016, and voted straight democratic today. im listening to her book and playing video games. i still feel so badly that somebody who was so qualified lost to someone who isnt. "
3543,3553,1,sick!!!https://twitter.com/thebeatwithari/status/1055230515710701569
3544,3554,1,"throughout history. past, present and future. its the tougher more rightous fight, and in the end they will lose. but a person feels good inside fighting it in the mean time."
3545,3555,1,i still can't believe the voting computers are hooked up to the internet. 
3546,3556,1,so...a guy called pecker and a pornstar will be the end of the orange fascist.who comes up with this sh*t?

3554,3564,1,"you're equating the plight of white men with the plight of poc and women.that's only something that you can do from a viewpoint that is racist in nature.there's a good chance that you were called racist or sexist in relation to your behavior, but you didn't see your own behavior that way, so you think it's just because you're a white guy.i'm a white guy.  i have never been called racist or sexist or anything of the sort, except for the relatively few times i deserved it.  it's not that hard.edit:  you don't seem to understand that the plight of any individual white man is not related to his manness or his whiteness, so there's no need to defend those identities  (since they're not the targets of oppression)... that only makes sense from a white supremacist pov.yes, it is important to push back against the oppression of individuals based on their race, sex, orientation, religion, and gender.white men are simply not oppressed based on their race or sex.  to act as though there's an oppression that needs to be pushed back against is white supremacy.  that's the trump campaign in a nutshell, and you're repeating a similar framing.  that's prolly why folks've called you racist and/or sexist."
3555,3565,1,"well fuck... the smug satisfaction of saying i told you so wears thin after a while. i work a blue-collar resource extracting job where nearly everyone voted for trump and are only now figuring out that his stance on nafta, and trade means we're all unemployed. to make it even worse, one of the reasons i had considered myself a swing voter in past elections is because i strongly agreed with the gop and their position on free trade. now the gop in their pusillanimity (yes i'm breaking out the big words) have decided that undermining one of the key principals of the party platform is better than upsetting trump voters."

3557,3567,1,in a way itd be better for her to win after trump delivers congress to the democrats.   thats give her at least 2 years to create change. the house should go dem this year and maybe the senate but more likely in 2020.    i just wish her campaign ran better ads. show old white guys who used to hate her but then realized she was alright. show people whove known her their entire lives.  this time you could show trump voters saying how wrong they were. and get bill out there more!  its not too late.

3608,3618,1,"sure i guess some of those were mistakes. but a statistically insignificant drop in an ocean of people who did not vote for her is hardly a reason to hate somebodies guts or damn them to hell. by the way some of your claims about bernie not frequently or forcefully telling his voters to vote for hillary when he started campaigning for her are demonstrably not true. and even hillary said he was an effective and hardworking campaigner for her after the primary, in her book.oh and if bernie holding out for so long was so influential to her losing then why was she so far ahead of trump up until a few weeks before the election?"

3625,3635,1,"comey took three extremely public actions, against the advice of his superiors at the doj, that were unprecedented. it was foreseeable before he took those actions that they would affect the outcome of the election. it is undeniable in hindsight that they did in fact have a decisive impact.it seems that he took a risk. he figured that hillary clinton was a lock to win, so he could do what he did without real consequences. in the end, he thought that would make the fbi look independent and the election would be unaffected. things only seemed this way because she had such a seemingly insurmountable lead. it turned out it wasn't insurmountable, so his estimation that his actions would not impact the election was wrong. the risk he took didn't pay off and rather than having his cake and eating it too, we got trump and the fbi is under more scrutiny now than they ever would have been had he quietly handled the case the same way the fbi handles every other case: quietly and professionally."

3628,3638,1,>i hope you will all buy it for your daughters and granddaughters.and sons and grandsons! 
3629,3639,1,maybe someone should remind her she lost to an umpa-loompa.

3632,3642,1,"you're full of shit.she worked for the children's defence fund, she initiated chip: healthcare for children. she supported immigration reform, which would provide a solution for dreamers.take your hate filth lies elsewhere."
3633,3643,1,"i've voted for democrats in every single primary and general election for single every office, ever since i had the opportunity to vote for jerry brown for president in 1992. i'm a democrat, and i've always been in the economic & foreign policy progressive wing of the party, the one which usually gets its clock cleaned by the moderates. doesn't make me any less of a democrat though. shame on anyone who'd tell me i'm not, it's straight-up poison for our party."
3634,3644,1,can we blame the person who did it?
3635,3645,1,"i don't know why you would say something that cluelesd, she puts herself in the news, travels around and does political speeches and works to stay relevant so obviously she's she will be part of the conversation."
3636,3646,1,totally. 
3637,3647,1,trump is low life useless.
3638,3648,1,"she's a politician with a lengthy history of some...questionable choices, she should sit their and take questions. "
3639,3649,1,"i remember the days before the election when we all used to come here and chat. it was a place to voice our anxieties about the upcoming election. a place of comfort, a refuge where succor was asked for and received. i knew people by their usernames.  some i still follow on twitter.  after the election, i came by less and less. i miss that place. nothing has replaced it for me."
3640,3650,1,but *she* needs to go away and shut up 
3641,3651,1,it won't happen until money is lost. it's not jesus they worship; it's the dollar.

3643,3653,1,> she seems practical and strategicyou mean shes a sell out!?! 
3644,3654,1,"there was no real journalism when it came to coverage about hillary - not now and not during the elections. this is the kind of shit that the so called ""liberal"" media constantly spewed and they continue doing so... why? "
3645,3655,1,"as expected, rabid right-wingers have vowed to boycott harvard which is convenient considering none of them could actually be accepted to the university in the first place."
3646,3656,1,so youre not just none stop posting your bernie crap here but youre sexist too.got it
3647,3657,1,been seeing a lot of talk of hillary running in 2020 from fox news and other right wing websites - it seems they're getting really worried about the blue wave. 
3648,3658,1,thats my badass!
3649,3659,1,"a lot of propaganda, somewhere between 6-12% of bernie supporters voted for trump.  that is very, very low compared to historical data when people swap the party vote."
3650,3660,1,jeff sessions is a liar who supports wife-beaters.  maybe he should be deported to el salvador and we can all see how he does.
3651,3661,1,"i'm busted for what? being a republican, which i am openly? you bet i'd vote for mitt or marco or ted if they had the nod. i'm just very anti-tump. that doesn't mean that hillary isn't well left of bill."
3652,3662,1,"pass. next generation, please.looking for the top edge of millenials or younger generation x, to be clear. someone brought up in tolerant times, no misty eyed rose colored memories of the 60s, and a firebrand for liberty."
3653,3663,1,"in my opinion, yes. i'm not trying to argue the point here, i'm just saying this is how i and many others feel. in terms of daniel elazar's political culture typology, ny is primarily an individualistic state meaning party politics is key and most voters will vote for party over the personality of individual candidates. an example of this would actually be hillary clinton's runs for us senate there. i'm just saying that given this individualistic political culture, cuomo is much more likely to win."
3654,3664,1,"hillary voter here. i think she and bill should go focus on the clinton initiative. regardless of how little is fact, she is an extremely divisive public person and the gop will make this about her and obama. again. my daddy taught me you cant fux stupid so we need some fresh blood to try and water this liberty tree and impeach the shitstain of america "
3655,3665,1,we should also note that hillary had a bigger margin of more popular votes than many presidents who won both popular and electoral.
3656,3666,1,"but ""both sides"" argument continues ..."
3657,3667,1,but they're being separated according to a law her husband signed.  why didn't she stop this before it became a serious issue?
3658,3668,1,"they've been sore winners for the past two years, does this surprise anyone?  they seem to get pleasure out of our pain and fear."
3659,3669,1,"if people bothered to show up to vote**instead of giving into the ""both sides are equally bad so don't bother "" psy-op."
3660,3670,1,"yeah me too.i dont get it, what is wrong with people when the clinton's are involved?they're being attacked for 30+ years day in day out, but they're not allowed to defend themselves?"
3661,3671,1,capitalism is a tool of white supremacy. the white controlled media can only trick poc to support the capitalist state for so long. 
3662,3672,1,and they continue their war on women. #believesurvivors
3663,3673,1,"a white mans life is different depending on the city, state and region you live in and economics plays a huge role.  if you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.  i didnt say white men are oppressed and i wont say their privileged either, they live a human life.  the homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him hes privileged and thats why you wont give him any money.even trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  if white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.a year ago i moved from oklahoma to los angeles.  the two cultures are so vastly different.  the democratic party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country thats why we are where we are at.  in oklahoma where i was apart of the democratic party, the hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in oklahoma as sexist and say thats why they wouldnt vote for clinton but at the very same time we had a female republican governor running the state.  texas, kansas, louisiana, arizona and many other red states have had female governors while states like new york and california have not.its not about privilege, race or gender its about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.  sad to say but democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican (trump  is not average).  obama brought people together clinton divided.  we all lost when her campaign started dividing people and it started long before trump got the republican nomination."
3664,3674,1,"um, i was making fun of great awakening for being so stupid. "
3665,3675,1,https://twitter.com/ap_politics/status/1004222651622215680
3666,3676,1,"it's an important question. one which i've asked myself since nov 2016. i had hoped by now there would have been at least 2 or 3 candidates from the democrats but unfortunately, they've fallen victim to the same ""tea party"" mentality and let bernie cloud the direction of the party. i have seen a lot of push back against bernie recently which is good for the democrats but is it too late? i don't know. i feel like the democrats let him take over the conversation and have suffered because people like tim ryan, jason kander etc have been sidelined.we have two years. hopefully it's enough time to focus on supporting candidates who aren't beholden to the fringe and move away from populist rhetoric.the window is getting smaller though."
3667,3677,1,i'm convinced he is a successful decades old russian mind control victim. what else explains his words and actions? he's a fraud. the once gop's desperate coward politics gave him and putin their opening. i'd bet money on it.
3668,3678,1,"with the position that he has, he was wrong to assume what he did wouldn't have any impact 11 days out from election day whether it's his job or not. he's a fool."
3669,3679,1,"do republicans really think that democrats are commies? i mean i know some idiots who say that, but really? that just seems a little outdated to me. now, they just yell 'identity politics' repeatedly. "
3670,3680,1,"megyn kelly is one of those people who likes to be rebellious, sort of like megan mccain, but as she's trying to be her own woman per se, she actually is regurgitating what her husband and step-father have been spoon-feeding her since she tragically lost her real father as a young woman. i say this because i know what it's like to lose your father at a young and very impressionable age. her ""hero"" is a staunch republican, no doubt, whoever it may be, and she is their robot. am i right? maybe not, but she definitely is not her own woman. megyn, use that brain of yours and think!"
3671,3681,1,"yes, white nationalists should stop bringing race into everything."
3672,3682,1,and she sold uranium to russia
3673,3683,1,i'm trying to figure out what started all the articles and reports of her running again. i'm on forward together email list and see no mention of running again. do you get the sense this is part of the propaganda disinformation campaign started by gop and russian operatives?
3674,3684,1,wish she were campaigning for them as president :(
3675,3685,1,"i love hillary, but i think she needs to go away. too divisive, unfortunately. (not because she is actually divisive herself, but between bernie fanatics, republicans, and russian trolls, plus a huge fraction of the american electorate is *really* stupid.)i actually feel the same about warrentheyve been working to smear her for years.and bernie, though im not much of a fan of his.i would vote for any of them in a general election, but id rather see harris or duckworth or someone else who the republican party hasnt yet demonized.and i think there should be plenty of good candidates, but now is not the time to worry about it. we need to push as hard as we can with the midterms and start worrying about 2020 next year."
3676,3686,1,"yeah, i held off on comey and omarosa's books because i wasn't sure about them as a source but this one might be worth reading."
3677,3687,1,hitler organized the nazi party movement in the exact same way and they still don't see it or just don't care.
3678,3688,1,please do not use the r word.
3679,3689,1,"khm, someone posted this in replies to the tweet http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363they seem not to like him."
3680,3690,1,"fuck off, troll."
3681,3691,1,the problem is that republicans simply refused to accept an obama appointment. 
3682,3692,1,">it is kind of offensive that someone would suggest the more progressive democrats are a wedge that can be used to peel off some more support for this republican party.true, but at the same time, it doesn't do any good to be so close-minded in local govt. tbh, i hate it when local govt candidates even label themselves as rep or dem unless it's just for political sway....which is the whole reason for campaigning. but still, sometimes local govts get really bloated or get pigeonholed for no other reason than being a certain label. for example, in india there are different political groups per state sometimes even city. it seems more specialized to me for local issues which is nice."
3683,3693,1,"can we stop making ""establishment"" sound like a bad word?  i don't know about anyone else, but i want people with experience running the country."
3684,3694,1,"3 years of none stop hate mongering towards clinton and obama by fascist trump and now someone sends them bombs, are people really surprised??vote these dangerous republicans out!!!"
3685,3695,1,"ok, just making sure bc that is interesting.  let's see if more studies can confirm. what would one call this phenomenon? what is the name of it? the republican convention had crazy amounts of anti women paraphernalia and souvenirs though, so it just feels wrong. the truth of the matter is that neither side wholeheartedly supports female leaders....yet. it's not even political. it's just a fact of life. sure, the republicans can find a couple women to be a republican candidate, but would they support a more neutral society than patriarchal? heck no. at least dems nominated a woman first. we can say that.it's like gender equality is the 3rd wheel or 3rd rail or something. forget about dems vs reps and libs vs cons or even fascists vs commies, it's literally women and girls vs everyone else."
3686,3696,1,"i finally just watched [michelle wolf's routine](https://youtu.be/l8iypnnsyjw), and there was maybe one part that was a little too much, but i easily belly-laughed 4 times. very funny delivery! maybe she was too funny? if people can't make fun of themselves then something is very wrong with their self-esteem. i dont even think her best jokes were about huckabee, maybe the softball teams part, but otherwise it was hilarious. "
3687,3697,1,i think most people ha r made their decisions on comey and theres not much else to say.
3688,3698,1,thank you hillary for speaking up  for us.  and all women for the past 30 years.
3689,3699,1,"i've been carrying a 6 pack of new glaruss around with me waiting to celebrate. don't live there but congrats, and the beer was good."
3690,3700,1,"she perpetuated the myth that clinton was as bad as trump, and had a lot of influence with the bernie crowd. non hillary voters contributed to the mess that we are all in now. even - and especially - liberal non voters."

3705,3715,1,"are you for real? what kind of vacuous reality do you live in? not only are you making up blatant lies about the party but you're also completely discounting the progress that the democrats have enabled in this country. \> they've caused nothing but pain, really? fighting for gay marriage and getting it done is causing nothing but pain? fighting for equal pay is nothing but pain? fighting for universal healthcare has caused nothing but pain?where the hell are you coming from?you're regurgitating blind bernie bro crap.let me remind you... bernie already ran. he lost. his platform was weak. he barely had anything beyond his rhetoric.you want the democratic party to adopt bernie's policies? wtf are his policies? he's been in government for over 40 years yet we don't see any of his policies. he has none. bernie has spent mst of his time bashing democrats not trump. \> and the votes prove it. please tell which votes prove it... bernie losing in the primaries? or bernie backed candidates who have been losing? where are those votes? wake the fuck up instead of blindly following a 77 year old loser who has done nothing. that's the leadership you want? then you're welcome to trump."
3706,3716,1,cant fucking wait can hillary also do a martha stewart living-type or oprah-like show so i can watch every day and people can complain and tell her to go away? i was all prepped for eight years of hillary and im simply not getting enough rn

3713,3723,1,"i think this is really just a political cultural difference. i see higher positions of power as reserved for those who have climbed the ranks and earned it and you don't. ultimately it will come down to whether or not the voters of ny see it my way or yours, and given past elections i think they will vote for the establishment politician barring any unforeseen circumstances."

3722,3732,1,call me crazy but i think someone or something messed with the vote count and hillary actually won that election but there is nothing we can do about it cause there is nothing about this in the constitution 
3723,3733,1,seriously. maybe the system that made us the most prosperous country in the world wasnt terrible. 
3724,3734,1,not to mention she was basically accused of murdering americans in libya.

specific dates of rival candidates communications*by shelby holliday and  rob barryformer trump campaign adviser roger stone privately sought information he considered damaging to hillary clinton from wikileaks founder julian assange during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to emails reviewed by the wall street journal.the emails could raise new questions about mr. stones testimony before the house intelligence committee in september, in which he said he merely wanted confirmation from an acquaintance that mr. assange had information about mrs. clinton, according to a portion of the transcript that was made public.in a sept. 18, 2016, message, mr. stone urged an acquaintance who knew mr. assange to ask the wikileaks founder for emails related to mrs. clintons alleged role in disrupting a purported libyan peace deal in 2011 when she was secretary of state, referring to her by her initials.please ask assange for any state or hrc e-mail from august 10 to august 30--particularly on august 20, 2011, mr. stone wrote to randy credico, a new york radio personality who had interviewed mr. assange several weeks earlier. mr. stone, a longtime confidant of donald trump, had no formal role in his campaign at the time.in another email, mr. credico then asked mr. stone to give him a little bit of time, saying he thought mr. assange might appear on his radio show the next day. a few hours later, mr. credico wrote: that batch probably coming out in the next drop...i cant ask them favors every other day .i asked one of his lawyers...they have major legal headaches riggt now..relax.mr. credico said in an interview with the journal that he never passed the message on to mr. assange or his lawyers, but got tired of mr. stone bothering him, and so told mr. stone he had passed along the message. mr. credico said he did so because he owed mr. stone a favor for helping him book libertarian presidential candidate gary johnson as a guest on his show.mr. stone, in a text message to the journal, said that mr. credico had provided nothing to him and that wikileaks never handed anything over. both men deny ever having special access to wikileaks material.i never had possession or access to any clinton emails or records, mr. stone said, adding that his testimony before the house committee was complete and accurate.adam schiff (d., calif.), the ranking member of the house intelligence committee, said the emails hadnt been provided to congressional investigators. if there is such a document, then it would mean that his testimony was either deliberately incomplete or deliberately false, said mr. schiff, who has continued to request documents and conduct interviews with witnesses despite the committees probe concluding earlier this year said.a lawyer for mr. stone, grant smith, said the emails hadnt been turned over to house investigators because they were not encompassed within the scope of the committees request. mr. stone said the emails were preserved at the request of the senate, which is also conducting a russian interference probe. mr. smith said they hadnt yet been given to investigators there.the newly unearthed emails come amid signs that special counsel robert muellers team is examining mr. stones role in mr. trumps 2016 presidential campaign. among other matters, prosecutors have asked about mr. stones claim to have met with wikileaks during the campaign, according to a witness familiar with the investigation.u.s. officials have said wikileaks received material from operatives working on behalf of russias military intelligence group, which mr. assange has denied. the kremlin has denied it meddled in the election.messrs. stone and credico said they havent been contacted by mr. muellers office, which declined to comment. wikileaks didnt respond to requests for comment.in the initial email, which included an attachment with photos of libyan dictator moammar gadhafi and other documents, mr. stone sought to confirm speculation that mrs. clinton had unnecessarily supported the decision to continue bombing libya during the height of the countrys civil war in 2011. the conflict ultimately led to ghadafis killing at the hands of opposition forces. a spokesman for mrs. clinton didnt respond to requests for comment.several weeks after mr. stones email request, on oct. 3, 2016, an article ran on infowars.com, a conservative news outlet to which he frequently contributed during the campaign. the article included some of the same images as mr. stones initial email to mr. credico, and didnt include any unreleased clinton-related emails or wikileaks material.the emails appear to be consistent with mr. stones description in his sworn testimony of mr. credico as a go-between and an intermediary to wikileaks during the 2016 campaign, according to a portion of his interview that was made public.mr. credico, who considers himself a supporter of wikileaks, has publicly raised questions about the details of mr. stones claims and in recent weeks has called some of them false.mr. credico said his relationship with mr. assange and his team didnt begin until late august 2016, when the wikileaks founder agreed to do his radio show. by that time, mr. stone had already claimed to be in touch with mr. assange and appeared to predict the release of information damaging to mrs. clinton. mr. stone now says he assumed mr. credico was in touch with mr. assange during that time.after earlier asserting his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination in the house probe, mr. credico now says he is willing to talk with investigators. he said he met on wednesday with the committees democratic staff members for what he called a limited conversation about wikileaks, the 2016 campaign and mr. stone.as mr. credico has become more vocal about what he says are discrepancies in mr. stones account, mr. stone has responded with a series of threats, according to emails and text messages reviewed by the journal.in early april, in one of those emails, mr. stone accused mr. credico of serving as an informant.everyone says u are wearing a wire for mueller, the april 7 email said. two days later, mr. stone wrote: run your mouth = get sued. mr. credico denies being an informant.mr. stone said he was warning mr. credico against defaming him and urging him to simply tell the truth."

(specifically that half the reef died in the last year.) weve reached a point of no return. in the late 1800s oil execs predicted that our carbon emissions would affect the atmosphere.in the 1970s scientific consensus was that global warming was happening and was caused by human activity.in the 2000s republicans claimed that human activity is not causing climate change and branded the truth, science, and factual information as a political issue.i have always considered myself a conservative democrat, a moderate, but lately im told that im a big state leftist.... and perhaps that is coming true.in a classically liberal sense, the free market should solve our climate and environmental problems, but the market failed. the market failed when patents for electric cars were bought by fossil fuel interests. the market failed when propaganda convinced half of american voters that climate change is a myth. we have reached a point of no return.the best we can hope for is an acclamation to our changing planet. similarly to every conversation americans (especially our representatives) should be having, regarding factual evidence based policy, one side just claims that there is no problem, and thus forcing anyone who is educated to take an extreme stance.  this applies to gun legislation, environment, immigration, automation, healthcare and so much more.i hope this rant is read by anyone and that im not just crying into the void.

""blame men for mollie tibbetts' murder"" is going to drive them away. there are about a hundred less toxic ways to engage in a discussion about violence against women than starting it with ""blame men"", or trying to counter-troll the right's dumb claim that illegal immigration caused the murder. look, i know that journalists don't write their own headlines, that's fine, but someone chose to put that, and in my view it's utterly toxic. the left should be about uniting people, and bringing people together."

3932,3942,1,"that is suspicious. if i had to take a guess, there might have been some folks who went in to vote for stein without bothering with the lower parts of the ticket.then again, i'd imagine some normally-republican voters who voted for johnson would also pick hillary out of disgust with trump, pick mr. where's aleppo, or just leave the top of the ticket blank."
3933,3943,1,have you read the 2016 democratic platform that hillary ran on at all?
3934,3944,1,wonderful!!!!!
3935,3945,1,go to r/fuckthealtright   and it was reposted about 4 hours ago and is still up.
3936,3946,1,"well this guy was avowedly anti-trump. however, anyone can see that trump and other republicans are inciting this hate through their rhetoric, actions, and inactions. the fact that the inciting reason for this shooting was an immediate fear of invasion from the refugee caravan lays the blame squarely at trumps doorstep. yet within hours trump will be fear mongering about an invasion again if he hasnt already. "
3937,3947,1,"sigh.. what was an enjoyable lunch break is being ruined as i sit here and listen to this guy next to me talk to his colleague...""for the most part i don't like anything trump has done but at least he's not hillary."" ""i did like his tax bill though."" ""i used to be a liberal democrat but a few years ago i became conservative.""""liberals have shouted racism so much that it's lost its meaning and now people are more racist."" bla bla bla ""identity politics."" then he went on to say again that he doesn't like trump and how polarizing trump is and that when he and his wife were traveling internationally last year people would ask where they're from and he'd say american and they'd roll their eyes at him with ""ooh, *trump*"" and he that didn't make him feel good and was embarrassing. so he's conservative, used to be liberal just a couple years ago, and hates trump. but hates clinton more? i can't imagine what clinton did to make him ""never hillary,"" especially when he was liberal just a few years ago, but whatever it was, why not also be ""never trump"" if he's so aware to how awful and embarrassing trump is? i just don't get it.

3944,3954,1,"is anyone else tired? i'm tired today. since november 2016 i've been angry. i've been fighting. every bit of news got me angrier and more determined than i was before. but after the news today, i'm just tired. i feel like nothing matters anymore. i'm sure tomorrow i'll go back to fighting, but today i just feel defeated. i feel like i just ran a marathon, and as soon as i could see the finish line, it got moved back another 50 miles. i'm just tired and depressed. my personal life has been nothing but struggle lately, my professional life is nothing but struggle, politically it is a non-stop fight. when does something good happen?someone posted on a facebook group i'm in asking for some positivity. anything that made you smile recently. tons of people commented about stuff, and i had nothing. the world just sucks lately."

3948,3958,1,"hillary, and the majority of her supporters went out of their way to ""make nice"" after the primary. in fact, hillary bent herself into a pretzel trying to be considerate to bernie and his supporters. sadly, they weren't having it. it literally, and i mean literally, took a meeting with obama \(not to mention biden and schumer among others\) to try and get bernie to stop the attacks. it didn't work. in fact, even his own team tried to talk him down, and that didn't work either. so yeah, i'll do whatever it takes to keep bernie from winning the nomination. i'll make thousands of calls, donate money to his opponents, volunteer, canvas, hire hundreds of russian bots to spread disinformation, so gullible people like you turn against him. whatever it takes to keep the democratic version of trump from taking over the party, i'll do. as i said earlier, fuck bernie panders."

3960,3970,1,bernie and his cult spent a year pissing in the democrat's pool and then blamed hillary when voters didn't jump in.
3961,3971,1,i finally actually agree with her. she is exactly right. democrats need to stop being civil and point out that one side is virtually a hate group at this point. it appears she has learned her lesson from the election after all. 
3962,3972,1,"or maybe the republican views are not as unpopular as you think. maybe you only think that because you live in an echo-chamber of bad ideas.the extent of humanities  impact on the environment is still unknown.gun control has been a losing issue for democrats for years since many southern democrats love guns and would never switch to give the city democrats the votes they need.i think youd also find that many republicans could care less about gays getting married, but question the federal government strong-arming citizens into participation (cake bakers). "
3963,3973,1,"i did vote for her. i dont know what to tell you. youre not the first who has jumped down my throat for being a hillary-voter but not a hillary-fanatic. thats one of the things i didnt love about her campaign - youre either with us, or against us! "

""nobody would suggest that the russian intervention was the only factor behind the election outcome, but if you talk to experts like **former fbi agent clint watts, what he will tell you is that if it were not for the russian intervention, donald trump would not have been within even striking distance of hillary clinton.****""i think we have great cause to fear for the security of our elections in 2018 and 2020.** donald trump benefited from the russian intervention in 2016, donald trump probably would not be president if it weren't for the russian intervention in 2016, and he shows very little interest in opposing the russians.""

3980,3990,1,"a heloc is not a bailout. it allows a homeowner to tap equity from their home. the ideal reason to do this is to eliminate high interest credit card debt or do much needed repairs on a home. a renewal heloc would have simply paid off the existing heloc, and then given the same terms as the first heloc for another 10 years. if anyone thinks that's a bailout then they are more hard hearted than republicans.as for trump, it was the combination of an agreement between hillary clinton and barack obama to not admit to anything that could look like an oversight or mistake, including not responding to bernie sanders and some crazy claims he was making against hillary clinton. then factor in obama's not so nice comment about the heartland having a lot of bible thumping, gun loving, bitter over losing jobs, people.the less hillary went into the heartland, the more the heartland felt that trump was the only candidate who was willing to not stay quiet and who did not want to raise taxes. i'm suggesting that hillary clintoin losing moderates to trump was a 1 or 2 proposition, every moderate hillary clinton lost meant two votes for trump."

3992,4002,1,"> maybe, but the media probably had good reason to avoid talking about that hate.i don't believe the media avoided it out of some moral responsibility... they simply refused to acknowledge the empowering of bigotry. and it's just not with trump - they've been doing it since obama was elected with the rise of the tea party. i would buy the argument that the media willfully didn't cover the hate to stop spreading hate and violence but since trump has been in office we've seen journalists from the nyt write editorials after editorials about trump supporters.we're seeing more analyses and articles like this now but it's a little too late imo... kinda after the fact.

4000,4010,1,"we all had this discussion every day for months before and after the election. comey isn't really providing much new information so there's no much new to discuss. not that another discussion isn't welcome but many of us just have nothing else to say.personally, i don't hate comey but i hold him responsible for his mistakes. i don't think he is holding himself responsible. i give him a little credit for grappling with this all in public because that must be difficult. but as far as i know he has yet to really take responsibility.for all the crowing he does about the public's perception of integrity at the fbi he sure seems okay with the idea that the fbi director became a household name by determining the outcome of the presidential election. the idea that the public has a better perception of the fbi because of the way he acted is silly.because of his actions this country got trump and the fbi is no better off. he stepped out of protocol for this?"
4001,4011,1,"thats true.  it on the other hand, she seems practical and strategic. my hope is that someone with  legislative and policy expertise takes her u dear their wing. if she sticks with bernie, shes just going to become a scapegoat when something bad happens, and get zero credit for anything good she does.

4027,4037,1,"well theres been multiple studies to prove their is virtually no longterm negative health effects. making it at the very least a healthier alternative then alcohol. it provides a budding sector to the economy which can be heavily taxed making it an excellent economic benefit. it will eliminate mass incarceration of petty drug crime which is a dual benefit of eliminating a mass money suck of prison and court tax dollars for bull shit such as personal marijuana possession; as well as no longer hindering the lives of everyone effected by it (predominantly minority communities) allowing them not to a red check on their name for a virtually victimless crime. finally we have the evidence of states that have legalized it as well as entire countries where there has been no societal break down, and no notable negative affects. personally, i think the only argument that remains against marijuana is the boogeyman perspective that has been instilled in us from archaic, racist, unfounded views. "
4028,4038,1,"um, that doesnt make sense according to math.more americans who voted that day, wanted hillary. according to mathaccording to the rules, trump won. not according to voters. as in americans who voted that day.do you understand this simple concept?"

"
4033,4043,1,"kudos to our nominee for the governor of georgia. heres to hoping that she can turn out democrats, rather than trying to win back rural white voters. the key difference between obamas win and clintons defeat was the lack of record turnout from african americans. this race will be the test to see how well a candidate like her can do. this is especially interesting in a state like georgia."
4034,4044,1,that has nothing to do with what i posted.political_revolution is a sub which actively campaigned for jill stein in 2016 (one of its moderators posted again and again how he was a stein supporter) and allowed trump supporters to post shit about hillary.the sub itself is toxic trash which directly helped trump become president and it shouldnt crosspost here.

4048,4058,1,"i mean isn't it left wing anti-fa communist inspired groups the one blocking traffic and breaking city property all over the west coast? i keep seeing videos of both sides fighting each other all the videos i see is these proudguys beating up antifa guys and antfa guys breaking city property, personal property not letting people pass blocking streets etc. these proudboy guys might be taking it too far beating the shit out of these antifa guys but atleast they are not randomly destroying property and being aggressive to random people driving down the street.  as for fascism and communism these antifa guys wear communist regalia, and have communist flags at rally's but the other side doesn't ever carry nazi flags or any fascist symbols so how can you claim these guys are fascists but not claim the other side are communists? i really wanted to vote for hillary and support this movement but i cant just sit here and believe propaganda because it supports my side, if you actually want to win next election you need to just grow up and be realistic stop supporting communist idiots because they push your agenda and fight real fascism which is suppression of speech and ideas even if those ideas go against your own. the course we are on now is just re-election of trump because 90% of people can see through these lies, if name calling is the only thing this party has going for it good luck.

4054,4064,1,"nice way to completely ignore the content of the article.berners have doctored screenshots before to take down a black women.you are defending an unbelievably racist, antisemitic group of bernie supporters, versus a woman who has never before lied.i believe joy ann reid over racist bernie scum anytime.ps: i am gay and there is not 1 sec i believe the bernie crew acted out of concern about homophobia.edit: i have screenshots of unbelievably vile ewige jude type of images this group made of dws.i'll post them when i get home."
4055,4065,1,and it's unfortunate that it's just starting to be really talked about.
4056,4066,1,i'm convinced he is a successful decades old russian mind control victim. what else explains his words and actions? he's a fraud. the once gop's desperate coward politics gave him and putin their opening. i'd bet money on it.
4057,4067,1,the only problem is that the quantum physics is not completely understood yet...at least last time i read about it.

4076,4086,1,"if this is paywalled for you:**israeli intelligence firms election-meddling analysis comes under muellers scrutiny***psy-group presentation outlines ways trump campaign was helped by fake social media accounts*by byron tau and  rebecca ballhausspecial counsel robert muellers investigators have obtained a presentation prepared by an israel-based private intelligence firm that outlines ways in which donald trumps 2016 election was helped by fake news and fake social-media accounts, according to people familiar with the presentation and documents reviewed by the wall street journal.mr. muellers interest in the presentation suggests his investigation is focusing on the role of social-media manipulation during the 2016 campaign. intelligence officials have said that cyber-influence campaigns, sometimes covertly sponsored by foreign governments, are expected to become a major part of political campaigning in the coming years.the presentation consists of nine slides and was prepared by the psy-group, a firm that boasts of ties to elite israeli intelligence agencies. it isnt clear who received the psy-group presentation, but it appears to have been created sometime after the 2016 election.people familiar with the presentation describe it as an internal analysis drawn up by the firm to drum up u.s. political businesssaying that it was essentially used as marketing material for the firms operation and analytical capabilities. it also represents a proof of concept of how a firm like psy-group would have manipulated the 2016 campaign as well as future campaigns, people said.it is unclear how much of the presentation consists of the firms analysis of online activity during the campaign and how much is a hypothetical pitch.marc mukasey, a lawyer for mr. zamel, said the presentation copy that mr. mueller has obtained was a sample type analysis of what they could do.a spokesman for mr. mueller declined to comment.the presentation outlines the ways in which social media bots and fake online content were used to help energize voters supportive of mr. trump. one slide entitled trump campaign components outlines a timeline where fake news sites/avatars/content were created during the early part of the election year and then leveraged to spread uncertainty by midyear. the final stage was using fake bots to react to real life situations & further polarize the ta, or target audience, the slide says.another slide says the firm identified 140 pro-trump websites linked to a man in macedonia. the websites had american-sounding domain names such as worldpoliticus.com and published aggressively pro-trump content aimed at conservatives and trump supporters in the usa. worldpoliticus.com is no longer active.a person familiar with trump campaigns operations said it has absolutely no knowledge of what this firm was referring to in the slideshow.another slide outlines a facebook strategy where fake online profiles or avatars engage real people online and encourage them to share content. the result is a multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies, the slide says.in september, facebook disclosed that it identified about 500 inauthentic accounts with ties to russia that bought $100,000 worth of ads during a two-year period encompassing the presidential campaign.mr. mueller is investigating whether anyone in the trump campaign colluded in russian efforts to interfere in the election. moscow has denied meddling and mr. trump has denied any collusion by his campaign.the psy-groups founder, joel zamel, is under scrutiny from u.s. investigators because of his close relationship with the government of the united arab emirates and his involvement in a meeting with mr. trumps eldest son shortly before election day, the journal has reported.mr. zamel met with donald trump jr. at trump tower in the weeks before the 2016 election along with george nader, a top adviser to the crown prince of the united arab emirates, to discuss an offer to help boost the campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. erik prince, a u.s. defense contractor who specializes in the middle east and had close ties to the campaign, attended the meeting, the journal previously reported. people involved in the meeting say nothing came of it and the psy-group didnt perform any work for the trump campaign.a lawyer for mr. trump jr. said messrs. zamel and nader had pitched his client on a social media platform or marketing strategy and that he was not interested and that was the end of it.the presentation reviewed by the journal wasnt related to the trump tower meeting nor was it prepared for mr. nader, said mr. mukasey, mr. zamels attorney.mr. mueller has been investigating mr. zamels work and has interviewed mr. zamel about his business relationship with mr. nader, according to people familiar with the matter. mr. mukaseyhas said investigators have told him his client isnt a target of the probe. a subpoena concerning mr. zamels work, but not issued to mr. zamel, was reviewed by the journal.mr. nader has been cooperating with investigators since january, when investigators stopped him at dulles airport and served him with a subpoena.a lawyer for mr. nader said his client has fully cooperated with the special counsels investigation and will continue to do so. the lawyer declined to answer further questions.the psy-group was formed by mr. zamel, the son of an australian mining magnate who moved to israel to study counterterrorism. there, mr. zamel founded several companies beginning in 2010 and became increasingly close to the government of the u.a.e., the journal has previously reported. one of his companies, wikistrat, did war games and analysis for the u.a.e. in 2014 and say he was close to the national security adviser there, according to people familiar with mr. zamel.people familiar with the psy-groups operations say it provided intelligence services for political and corporate clients.after the 2016 election, the firm started to pitch for business in the u.s., including for the 2018 midterms. as part of its pitch to potential political clients, the psy-group said it had the capability of leveraging fake social-media accounts, which they call avatars, on behalf of political campaigns.psy excels at the use of online avatars that appear natural, unbiased and object. these avatars are highly effective at directing political messaging to target audiences, marketing materials reviewed by the journal say. these fake social accounts could be used for narrative warfare or to echo campaign messaging, the firm said.no political entity has made any payments to the psy-group since 2015, according to federal election commission records. the participation of foreign firms or individuals in u.s. elections is tightly controlled."

4156,4166,1,"i really don't think she would win if she ran again. if anything her running would energize the right all over again when that's the opposite of what you guys need, and she'd further divide the left. the right is too well versed on how to attack her and how to hit hard, it'd be better to have a candidate whose fairly unknown and can't be smeared through the mud as much and turn off moderates or people who are wishy-washy about the whole thing. historical precedence is not something to gamble four more years of trump against.

4159,4169,1,"it is still hard to read articles like this. one thing that has always seemed strange to me about wi is the fact that ron johnson beat russ feingold along with trump winning. i know johnoson was the incumbent , but feingold is a former senator , well known, and there was no reason he wouldn't have had support of lefties who refused to vote for clinton and voted for stein. if clinton + stein voters had more votes than trump, why didn't feingold win? i've never taken a deep dive into the numbers . did stein voters not bother to vote in the senate race? that senate race made even less sense to me than trump's victory here. without going full blown conspiracy theory i always have thought that should factor into the equation when investigating wi. wi did have a known voter data breach that the state gop downplayed. "
4160,4170,1,"i saw a comment posted here the other day saying that because of how polarizing trump is, and because of how he's able to distort reality and get away with it, he'll win in four years. i just... don't believe that. i won't get overconfident and say ""blue wave"" but there's a level of anger i haven't ever felt since i was able to vote. i really think we'll be okay, and have a competent president and cabinet again. we just need to hang in there."

4177,4187,1,"tack-on 1:    in related news, it *seems like* i've been seeing a lot more of ""this is why trump won,"" and ""liberals think everyone is a nazi,"" and ""give me something to vote *for,""* and ""hillary clinton can't be trusted"" than normal, but i could just be imagining things.  confirmation bias is universal, y' know?  so i decided to check it out.  this synopsis is courtesy of hamilton 68:    >*[the #walkaway movement, a campaign highlighting alleged discord among the left, got a boost this week from accounts linked to russian influence operations. the first use of the #walkaway hashtag from accounts monitored on hamilton 68 was noted in early june (a few weeks after the grassroots campaign began), but engagement remained relatively low throughout the month. activity spiked on july 2, when hamilton 68 noted 73 unique tweets using #walkaway, and roughly another 50 using related campaign hashtags (e.g. #walkawaymovement). the late engagement suggests kremlin-oriented accounts are trailers rather than leaders of the campaign, but the high-level of current engagement indicates an effort to astroturf support for the movement and hijack the narrative. this includes several monitored accounts that have changed their handles to include the hashtag, or that have shared their own supposed walkaway moments. the campaign also received a direct boost from russian propaganda outlets rt and sputnik, both of which ran stories on the movement.](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/)*     keep your eyes out for attempts to divide our movement, and our party, in ways both blatant and subtle.  *we lost the 2016 by 80,000 votes,* less than a football stadium, we can't afford to be at anything less than full strength this year.  a moment's foray into r/walkaway should tell the average user everything they need to know about the movement.  if you see someone using walkaway talking points around social media, take the time to disarm them.  i'm still hearing people talking about the ""rigged primaries,"" a talking point that was [disproven](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/14/16640082/donna-brazile-warren-bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-rigged), so either russia is playing its greatest hits, or people still believe it, or both.    our enemies will be pushing back at us just as hard as they did in 2016, and if they're smart they'll push back *even harder* now that they have an entire political party on their side, but we know what we're looking for, and how to defend against it.  call the bullshit, bullshit, and make sure everybody knows it's bullshit."

4180,4190,1,"as mueller slowly closes the noose, i worry about trump doing something really desperate and crazy either to distract public opinion or just out of plain spite. he is the president of the united states and the power he wields is awesome - there is nothing to stop trump from starting a war or even launching nukes. the current congress has shown they won't lift a finger to stop him, no matter what he does.pence is a loathsome christian taliban lickspittle, but he isn't quite the thoroughly corrupt narcissistic sociopath that trump is, and if it got to the point where trump were impeached pence simply would not have the political capital to get much accomplished."
4181,4191,1,/u/danie2009 - thought you'd appreciate the mary beard reference from hrc!
4182,4192,1,"your perspective tells me that you did practically zero information gathering from primary sources and mostly listened to propaganda spread by her opponents and russia.&#x200b;how many of her campaign speeches did you watch?  they are on c-span and youtube.  they didn't get covered by the news or pundits which were very busy talking about her xx chromosomes but she isn't in control of what they say, she is in control of what \*she\* says.  so in order to have an informed opinion of what she was saying you needed to have actually listened to her speak."
4183,4193,1,"hillary voter here. i think she and bill should go focus on the clinton initiative. regardless of how little is fact, she is an extremely divisive public person and the gop will make this about her and obama. again. my daddy taught me you cant fux stupid so we need some fresh blood to try and water this liberty tree and impeach the shitstain of america "
4184,4194,1,"not to mention that comey suppressed the fact that there were *multiple actively ongoing* fbi investigations of the trump campaign and its close associates at the same time he decided to rat-fuck the clinton campaign a week before the election.maybe the rabidly partisan congress and rightwing elements within the fbi put comey in a difficult position, but he could have pushed back against the gop cabal by putting *all* of the cards on the table - at least the voters would have had a more complete picture."

4307,4317,1,"you people should go to youtube and watch the videos of yourselves crying after the election.....hahahah.  seriously though, you people are pathetic and sad.  let it go."
4308,4318,1,"the polls were very close before the election. no polls were saying she would win in a landslide. maybe you are thinking of odds makers who gave clinton a 90% chance to win.i think confusion between the 55%-45% polls and the 90%-10% odds are a big part of what happened.no one with a basic understanding of statistics should call 90% a sure thing, anyway. i wouldn't trust my life to a couple coin flips, but too many hear 90% and think it means 99.99% or something. "
4309,4319,1,"depends whether the party mainstreamers run few enough candidates that they don't split that vote up between them, but enough so that it doesn't look like another attempted coronation. (also, on whether sanders can improve his showing in the south. seems like he's working on it.)frankly i hope another candidate from his wing runs, with his endorsement. i suspect he'd prefer that, but i believe warren when she says she doesn't want to run, and i'm not sure who else there is at that level."

4343,4353,1,the whole thing was bizaare.
4344,4354,1,"because people believe in all the stupid crap that republican propoganda tells them just like they believed in all lies that they told about hillary. they think democrats are no better than republicans. there are lots of other factors, but that one is the most i heard from them."

4346,4356,1,"i dont know anyone, literally, who supports or opposes people solely due to their racial/ gender attributes.do you think people in this sub would vote for palin or ivanka trump just because theyre women? or support sherrif clark because he's black?"
4347,4357,1,i'm suspicious voters were either changed or thrown out.
4348,4358,1,everyone of those replies under her tweets was from a name######## account. its so fucking obvious that theyre trolls. and still posting fd up pics of pedophilia
4349,4359,1,"if you refuse to educate yourself that's up to you.however, since you show you know absolutely nothing about hillary:for lgtb, you can read this excellent twitter thread by long time lgtb activist lisa talmadge: it documents 30+ years of lgtb activism and solidarity from hillary:https://twitter.com/lisatalmadge/status/891714303438532608it shows how hillary was always there for us, how she worked behind the scenes, showed support for aids patients (which sanders never did), showed up in lgtb parades (which sanders never did) and how she worked to advance lgtb rights in her time as  sos.about poc:you can start by reading this excellent thread by mrweeks, documenting hillary's life long commitment to the cviil rights movement:the mods of this sub have written down the thread in this sub:https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/6n6mn7/brilliant_must_read_thread_by_mrdane_black/now i get it: you're one of those people who doesn't know anything about hillary's record. you fell for the far right's propaganda. but stating hillary defended the status quo, when in fact she was there for us for 30+ years or even worse: saying she wasn't a champion for women, makes you a first class asshole.and your pathetic: ""but i voted for her"", is about as genuine and dishonest as the average trump supporter.whether you support trump or bernie, i dont know, but frankly: it's impossible these days to keep those two groups apart."
4350,4360,1,ya but trump and cult 45 love them
4351,4361,1,and she didn't say anything at the time.

4355,4365,1,a moron can not like trump at this point. a moron like dore and every single tyt bros. that doesn't mean that they are actually providing useful solutions or viewpoints which none of them are doing. bernie bros tactics are wearing thin.
4356,4366,1,whoosh...
4357,4367,1,what are the facts? you are yet to state any.
4358,4368,1,"like it or not it's our political climate and voters have a responsibility to vote for someone whether they feel inspired or not. and if they're not inspired, they should vote for a candidate that can handle the office and won't do harm to the country and its citizens. so yes voter shaming is ok because voters heavy duty, they have a responsibility, if they choose not to act that in of itself is negligence"
4359,4369,1,that's what i've been saying! when will we end the fascist manarchy
4360,4370,1,"wait any criticism of them is an attack on women and minorities? look mate, i'm liberal as well, but saying clinton was not a good candidate does not by any means attack all females. likewise, if someone says, i didn't like obama because of ""policy x, policy y, policy z"", that doesn't attack all minorities. i'm a poc myself, and i'd rather have talks that discuss that strengths and weaknesses of all candidates, both past and current, than shy away from it. pointing out their faults does not detract from their accomplishments, obama obviously will go down in history, as will clinton for their strides in their fields, given that they do not match the traditional layout of a male, white politician. they're both accomplished individuals, but that does not make them perfect. those who don't observe history, are doomed to repeat it. i dislike trump, but i think looking at why clinton lost and understanding what happened is key to ensuring a candidate such as trump does not take office. "
4361,4371,1,very nice message.  aretha's performance at the obama inaugural was absolutely incredible.
4362,4372,1,"good. perez has finally got the memo that hillary is a democrat and bernie is not.last year it didn't seem so.i applaud to the slogan in the headline. cambridge analytica tested it and it has worked before, despite the fact that the wrong people have used it. it should work again - for a good cause this time."

4366,4376,1,"i think establishment is referred to as a bias toward the status quo, which deserves criticism"

4369,4379,1,"glad to see her still involved.  i also have appreciated her reminders for voter registration deadlines, etc."
4370,4380,1,"i chose you but i was addressing all of you. it's too bad you folks are now republicans. like it or not, the clintons  pulled the dems so far to the right even reagan would be impressed.incidentally, if you compare the dems of today to the cons in reagan's time you would see that you have been turned so far to the right, reagan would be happy to have you as constituents. let that soak in.this is why the electorate is disgusted with the clinton clan and the so-called centrists.being centrist means capitulation is the order of the day. don't you think it's time to start pulling back to the left just a little bit?being centrist means you start from a position of weakness. when entering negotiations, you don't start with what you expect to accomplish. you start with what you actually want to achieve, like single payer health care and breaking up the too big to fail banks, corporations and the consolidated media that is blowing smoke up all of our asses every day. don't you want these things? seriously. don't you?"
4371,4381,1,this isn't how statistics works. you don't need to poll 325 million people to make statistically significant conclusions about that population.
4372,4382,1,"i never bought the ""white working class"" narrative.  as someone who falls into the ""white working class,"" i think it was just the media's way of trying to avoid talking about how trump gave so many people the courage to be horrible people."

4397,4407,1,"""blame men"" is not ""discussing the fact that women who reject a man sometimes end up murdered and that most murderers are men."" ""blame men"" is identity politics.should we ""blame black people"" because black people on average have a higher rate of murders than white people? no. there are a complex web of historical and socioeconomic reasons for this, such as slavery, such as jim crow, such as mass incarceration of black fathers via the war on drugs.well there's a complex web of phenomena behind this. men today did not invent the expectation that men should make the first move in dating, or male ""toughness"" & ""boys don't cry"", or the idea that a rejection is somehow an insult. those things are nasty inheritances that have arisen from the fact that our societies have developed in a patriarchal manner, and these expectations have proven difficult to shed.i don't have a concrete answer to any of these problems, but ""blame men"" is worse than doing nothing, it just creates resentment and retrenchment."

4430,4440,1,"maybe this is a weird thing to focus on, but this article was so oddly framed.  it feels like the writer was talking to an american for the first time and noting all the differences in language, rather than interviewing someone with a lot of wonderful things to say.of course chelsea wouldn't say, for example, ""well done,"" because that's a british colloquialism, and chelsea is american.  i'm trying to think of an american equivalent, but we don't really have one, and i feel like that's because, ironically enough, that turn of phrase sounds incredibly condescending to my american ears. from what i gathered, the writer has a problem with chelsea's american syntax, word choice, and construction, and uses that to chastise her for being too aloof.  i think the point the writer was trying to make, if i'm being generous, was that chelsea is polished (and of course she is, as the writer pointed out, she's always been in the political spotlight), but then she (the writer) called her language clunky, which negates that point.  i think chelsea's extremely well-spoken, yes, just like her mother.  but, i'm sick of that being termed as cold, especially from foreign press who, in this case, doesn't seem to understand our speech patterns.  i loved what chelsea said, but hated the framing of it.  maybe the writer could have focused on her meaning, rather than the words used to convey it.  but i guess i should take my own advice and focus on chelsea instead, too. :)"

"
4449,4459,1,"i'm happy i guess but honestly i just don't even try to understand things anymore. did any person on the entire planet think that trump didn't know and reimburse him? who thought cohen gave a hundred thousand dollars to stormy daniels on his own? why does the press humor this kind of bullshit? why does it take giuliani being a braindead moron to ""catch"" them in this lie?if this was a drug deal and it was in a court of law, and someone's lawyer was like, ""i gave this person that amount of money but my client didn't know"" under what circumstances would that be taken seriously? the lawyers for their side shouldn't need be also make ridiculous admissions. it was absurd from the start.sorry this stuff just makes me so frustrated. the way the press talks about this stuff is just silly."

4539,4549,1,"i think republicans were always jealous of bill clinton. he was the last president that created a tax surplus with a robust economy. if i remember, even after monica lewinsky, bill clinton left with a 60% approval rating. republicans did everything they could to damage them clintons, and it worked. the clinton family was never more shady than republican politicians. republicans created wars, took corporate money, had private servers under bush, had their version of benghazi, and their own mistresses. newt gingrich was the most epic example of hipocrisy. he hunted for bill clinton's monica lewinsky scandal, while turning around and having two mistresses. one of those wives had cancer while he was ducking around. republicans only seen to think democrats should be punished and called corrupt, but when they do it, it's okay. they lead to the worship of trump. he can't do anything wrong. so when someone tells you they want ""normal republicans"" back from trump, just remember those normal republicans created the support base that lead to trump. democrats, however, can't seem to do right in the eyes of the left. bernie and his progressives are willing to crash the democrats and make them lose, rather than joining and helping. problem is the right attacks dems as taking people's hardworking tax dollars, their guns, and allow the ""murder of babies, and as anti-white. the left of dems attacks them for not being progressive in the way they please. they want taxes raised, but these bernie bros keep insisting trump won because hillary wasn't progressive enough. that logic doesn't make sense because the majority of trump voters were lifelong republicans that want lower taxes and privatizing everything. why would they vote for self proclaimed socialist that wants to raise their taxes to pay for ""lazy people""?"

4571,4581,1,"did they really have to rehash trump's bus conversation? they are beating a dead horse with machetes at this point. there was no evidence that either confirmed or denied allegations against brett kavanaugh, so i don't understand why people think that they can just assume the investigation proved anything let alone successful for either side.  also i am 1/1024th cherokee.

4584,4594,1,"just got done going through bernie's ""ama"" and i'm wondering why he chose to do this a week before the mid terms especially when he only answers softball questions which allowed him to basically set up a platform for himself instead of actually highlighting candidates up for election next week.and not to mention the shameless plug for his own book - i i think most people would rather actually see the work he claims he's done to oppose trump's agenda instead of reading it in a book.. even more disingenuous when he's spewing his tired spiel about a government benefiting the wealthy while shamelessly trying to profit off his position and influence.he's basically spent the last two years bashing democrats and now it seems like he's trying to capitalize off the blue wave momentum.seriously though, what was the point of that ama? he talks a lot of anti-trump stuff but not one mention of progressive candidates we should be voting for. at this point he's nothing more than a copy and paste politician.

4620,4630,1,"i once got in trouble in high school for sending nudes and i told the principle that boys will be boys and she was a feminist pig and didnt get me at all, she thought i needed counseling. shes the worst in society"
4621,4631,1,"my daughter still can barely discuss 2016 without choking up.i remember her telling me, the day after, how she and her husband broke the news to their boys, then 6 and 8. one of them, crying, said, ""but he's a bad man! how can a bad man be president?!"" indeed."

4625,4635,1,"going into the future we need to be aware of the fact that people are individuals and that the only constant in this world is change. it seems that a major part of david's strategy is to get more persons of color to vote/be eligible to vote. ending the thought process there and just assuming that this will ensure a lasting majority is a mistake. i know if seems impossible to consider at this moment in time, but assuming that particular groups of people will vote the same way and at the same rates for all time is a mistake. there needs to be constant work to talk to as many people as possible. i was also surprised at the level of contradiction, or declaration of intent about gerrymandering in california. there is a good argument that california is too big and it's constituents would be better served if was broken apart. then david mentioned that his redrawing of the map would include 7 states that would have all voted for clinton by a good margin. that is pretty hard to do when california had about 200,000 less votes for trump than texas. to speak that another way, california has nearly as may trump voters as the entire state of texas. that is voter disenfranchisement on a massive scale. "
4626,4636,1,"susan collins slams the democrats for trying to ""use a survivor to advance a political agenda"", then proceeds to vote for the abuser who assaulted that survivor. the gop is full of hypocrites.and joe manchin is a bag of garbage as well."
4627,4637,1,"you're totally right, about everything. this is why i wish more women who have had to make the decision to get a abortion are afforded a louder voice. we are leaving it to conservatives and men who are framing the issue as pro-life vs pro-abortion which is not the case. there's the issue of our choice and autonomy but also the financial considerations you've spelled out. this is not discussed enough.also, how can ""pro-life"" people be against abortion and then also be against maternal and child health care? "
4628,4638,1,"it's always been a mystery to me how a guy who adamantly refuses to be a part of the democratic party has so much sway over its policies. dem leaders need to tell him, ""you want a voice in the party, sign up. otherwise, you're like any other non-member who gets no say in what we do."""
4629,4639,1,republicans would never go for either of them lol

4633,4643,1,"i am moderate but i don't mind seeing people like cortez bringing their ideas to congress. it's easy to be conservative if you feel like your and your family's future is relatively stable , but ideas like democratic socialism take hold because their is a wide swath of people who do not feel comfortable with their present or future. this brings their voice to the table. i don't agree with everything and on some points i probably actually lean conservative. take paid family leave for instance. i've had 2 kids and certainly that would have been more than helpful to get us through those early days. but i can look at the issue from the other side and see what would happen to school districts or certain healthcare organizations that are already barely keeping themselves above water if they had to suddenly provide for this expense. an idea that helps working families in one area is suddenly hurting kids in the classroom, because it is not just the googles of the world that would have to abide by a paid family leave law.  i do believe we need to be able to have a conversation with all voices heard. the conservatives have worked pretty hard to exclude liberals from the conversation so you will continue to see the far left get louder if that continues."
4634,4644,1,"do republicans really think that democrats are commies? i mean i know some idiots who say that, but really? that just seems a little outdated to me. now, they just yell 'identity politics' repeatedly. "
4635,4645,1,of course it's not illegal to print stolen documents or refer to them. it's illegal to steal them or to conspire with the thieves. receiving stolen property is a crime.

4637,4647,1,"i realized today... there are *so many* subreddits dedicated to hating on trump and the republicans, but the ones dedicated to the party who is working to fight trump and the republicans and promote the progressive policies that people want - the democrats subreddit - only sees a fraction of the traffic that the other subreddits do. why are people so afraid to latch onto the party that is working to help and fight? they only want to complain, not work to implement solutions.

4643,4653,1,that the obama administration had been able to keep russia at bay and handicapped with sanctions. it wasn't until a presidential candidate and an entire political party decided to work with russia that they began to have influence again.

4646,4656,1,yes. the moral character of our leaders is wildly important.

4672,4682,1,we would need the majority. mcconnell plans to get this through before the midterms to ensure that even if that were to happen it will be too late.
4673,4683,1,"i was a bernie supporter that realized how bad trump is and voted hillary in the general.  i never had any especially strong dislike of her or her policies, i just liked bernie's better, and i will never understand the people who wanted bernie but disliked hillary so much that they wouldn't even consider voting for her, or even worse, voting for trump.  after seeing how eagerly the party accepted this openly authoritarian psychopath, i will never vote for another republican as long as i live.that said: if you want to know what turned bernie voters away, it's this, right here, that you're doing right now.  do not dismiss our candidate as same policies, different name.  there were clear differences in how the two approached several issues important to progressives, and in how long the candidates had held certain progressive positions.  you don't have to agree with them (or even just their timing), but if you continue to dismiss the different voices in the party like this, the democratic party will continue to weaken and we will lose more elections to morons that we should have trounced."

4675,4685,1,his die hard followers are enough to be a nuisance to the democratic party but sadly not enough to effect change.and by that i mean that the things they are advocating are not enough to draw in new voters without simultaneously bleeding current party constituents.

4735,4745,1,"he didn't. nothing in his platform suggested it either. these guys are just angry at... something, i assume, but nothing really concrete. just the name bernie sanders, i guess. even though alexandria ocasio-cortez holds the exact same political positions that bernie held and supported him relentlessly, she's not bernie, so she's fine. all of the obnoxious rejections of democratic socialism, single-payer health care, tuition-free college, etc. have magically disappeared thanks to cortez's popularity, but still bernie remains the enemy because... salt? lol.you're not gonna get much rational debate from this subreddit. these guys lack any sort of logical perspective. they still don't even want to admit they're moderates and hardly even on the ""left-wing"" in the first place."

4770,4780,1,"hillary, and the majority of her supporters went out of their way to ""make nice"" after the primary. in fact, hillary bent herself into a pretzel trying to be considerate to bernie and his supporters. sadly, they weren't having it. it literally, and i mean literally, took a meeting with obama \(not to mention biden and schumer among others\) to try and get bernie to stop the attacks. it didn't work. in fact, even his own team tried to talk him down, and that didn't work either. so yeah, i'll do whatever it takes to keep bernie from winning the nomination. i'll make thousands of calls, donate money to his opponents, volunteer, canvas, hire hundreds of russian bots to spread disinformation, so gullible people like you turn against him. whatever it takes to keep the democratic version of trump from taking over the party, i'll do. as i said earlier, fuck bernie panders."

4824,4834,1,"i hear this every election. this is the one dems are going to slaughter them. then comes the election and dems never come close to expectations. other than a massive financial crisis (2008)dems get their asses kicked. they need to prove republicans are fixing elections with the russians or the electronic voting machine hacking, or they need to re-evaluate what they are doing to get voters. i don't believe for one second the republicans/russians lose either house this fall. "
4825,4835,1,a very key aspect of the importance of impeaching trump (or even about the effort to do so) this article and many others are missing is the fact that the process forces a form of accountability and checks and balances that the present government obviously has failed at. it's more than how his supporters will react - it's about checking a man who's actions are pushing this country dangerously close to becoming an authoritarian regime. 
4826,4836,1,does it matter? all these articles and this guy is still in office and he will probably still get re-elected. just seems like nothing is happening 
4827,4837,1,"when i texted my mom to tell her, she said, ""after he gutted the epa."""
4828,4838,1,because it's impossible to defend trump and deflecting is the only thing they can do.
4829,4839,1,again why would you think moderates would rally behind her if they won't rally behind sanders? moderates would take biden over warren any day. so would a lot of progressives. moderates would rally being harris and booker over her. your rationale of her uniting moderates and extreme leftists makes no sense.she's a weak bernie alternative for extreme leftists. 
4830,4840,1,i think all the techniques the article suggests are good ones.

4835,4845,1,"oh give me a break. stalin poisoned lenin. duh, everyone knows that. stalin poisoned everyone. "
4836,4846,1,"when someone pulls that shit on you, remind them that she won the popular vote by 2,900,000 votes, and trump only won the electoral college by 80,000 votes.  it won't shut them up, but at least it will change the subject."
4837,4847,1,it was phrased absolutely terribly.  it amazes me how a politician who was once as savvy as bill clinton can seem so clueless years later.

4845,4855,1,well have these people brought up any specifics apart from the vague insinuations? that's usually a red light because there aren't any. that's why it's a litmus test with hillary because as usual these kind of criticisms against her have no basis beyond vague insinuations and innuendos which all just add up to propaganda.
4846,4856,1,"hell yes, it makes me angry.  i was pissed the day of the women's march too. where were all these throngs of people when we were out knocking on doors? protests are minimal effort. get out and talk to voters. it is the only way."
4847,4857,1,your a joke! ya im sexist because i was on this sub constantly backing clinton treating her like a queen! no! you can be old and keep running as long as you show your staying up to date with the issues facing americans! bernie is doing that! hes showing his age has not gotten to his head and let it stop him from opening to new ideas! feinstein and pelosi barely just got on board for legal weed recently when the state they represented supported it by 60% are you kidding me? thats my issue with age! get old man and old women who wont evolve with the issue out of the federal government!

4850,4860,1,i think nevada and az look hopeful (rosen and sinema) for the senate.but if the dems lose even one seat those two wont help
4851,4861,1,"comey seems to think that mindlessly following rules, traditions, and norms is necessarily ""non-partisan"" and absolves him of any blame, never stopping to think that many of those same rules, traditions, and norms are *themselves* partisan, and aren't just simply because they're principles. for a guy who calls himself the paragon of impartiality and fairness, he seems very interested in ""perception"" and image and the press reaction and hype and optics--to a fault. i believe he is honest, and that he's telling the truth, but he also comes across as vain and sanctimonious as, say, kanye west....or bernie sanders.

"
4865,4875,1,and ads for dems are being produced as we speak ...
4866,4876,1,"but we never get to pass ""well thought-out policy"" because republicans exist in vast numbers, and the best we've been able to do by selling technocratic, incremental triangulation is to capture an insufficient 51% of the power for 2-year increments that come every 10 years or so, after republicans hit rock bottom and before they rapidly bounce back. the best we ever did was by selling ""hope and change,"" remember? imo we need to do something to disrupt the *underlying* political equation whereby all our well thought-out policies sit gathering dust on the shelf for decades upon decades. i can't think of a way to do that without a return to idealism, audacity, demonstrations of virtue and independence, and promises to try hard to make things *dramatically* better. at least that should be the public position."

4868,4878,1,"hey, i volunteered my heart out for hrc, but i have to agree - she wasnt very accessible.  she came to my area maybe 3 times, and twice was restricted to local community leaders.  her one semi-public appearance was at a tiny venue and publicized only through word of mouth in one small organization.  she almost never had large rallies, and none at all anywhere near me.  she didnt develop relationships with the reporters on her bus (maybe understandable, but not great politics).she had my vote no matter what, but its true that she wasnt very accessible.  hopefully the next candidate i support as much as i supported her, will handle public appearances differently."
4869,4879,1,"2006 was a good one for dems, too."
4870,4880,1,well you can start with the account that made the post op linked to. 
4871,4881,1,your literal last post (as of 1:21 est) on reddit is anti-semitic bs... so its okay to talk about race when its funny?
4872,4882,1,"are you for real? what kind of vacuous reality do you live in? not only are you making up blatant lies about the party but you're also completely discounting the progress that the democrats have enabled in this country. \> they've caused nothing but pain, really? fighting for gay marriage and getting it done is causing nothing but pain? fighting for equal pay is nothing but pain? fighting for universal healthcare has caused nothing but pain?where the hell are you coming from?you're regurgitating blind bernie bro crap.let me remind you... bernie already ran. he lost. his platform was weak. he barely had anything beyond his rhetoric.you want the democratic party to adopt bernie's policies? wtf are his policies? he's been in government for over 40 years yet we don't see any of his policies. he has none. bernie has spent mst of his time bashing democrats not trump. \> and the votes prove it. please tell which votes prove it... bernie losing in the primaries? or bernie backed candidates who have been losing? where are those votes? wake the fuck up instead of blindly following a 77 year old loser who has done nothing. that's the leadership you want? then you're welcome to trump."

4876,4886,1,his actions nonetheless were extremely damaging and likely threw the election outcome.
4877,4887,1,based on historical trends? we wait for them to get older.
4878,4888,1,"so what you're saying is, you don't actually have the slightest fucking clue what you're talking about?"
4879,4889,1,i have never heard rachel's crew laugh that loud. :d
4880,4890,1,">  almost all of which was based on her policies, decisions, and donors.um, again, please don't be revisionist here. his only attack against her was about the speeches and he painted her as corrupt for the speeches without any evidence. not once did he actually question her policies in any meaningful way. that's why he lost the debates. you're trying to paint a very revisionist picture of the primaries. please provide evidence.>how dare he question she who felt entitled to the nomination!and there you go, proving my point. it's only bernie and his supporters who think she was entitled. no one else did because she was actually qualified. when you twist someone's qualifications and experience as ""being entitled"" then there's a definite prejudice there."
4881,4891,1,because she is a strong experienced leader and trumpitler is an overweight old child who could never have succeeded if russia hadn't hacked the election for him. 
4882,4892,1,"megyn kelly is one of those people who likes to be rebellious, sort of like megan mccain, but as she's trying to be her own woman per se, she actually is regurgitating what her husband and step-father have been spoon-feeding her since she tragically lost her real father as a young woman. i say this because i know what it's like to lose your father at a young and very impressionable age. her ""hero"" is a staunch republican, no doubt, whoever it may be, and she is their robot. am i right? maybe not, but she definitely is not her own woman. megyn, use that brain of yours and think!"
4883,4893,1,"https://abetterdeal.democraticleader.gov/the-proposals/nah, just pointing out you made a new account for reasons... now you are trying to get me to attack you or something so you can report it and then delete your comments. it's basic."
4884,4894,1,honest question.why hasn't she supported progressive candidates cynthia nixon and alexandria ocasio-cortez against scandal plagued male incumbents.  
4885,4895,1,is this your standard response to anyone calling you out? if the party is failing it's because it's trying to accommodate people like you who can't even go beyond vague criticisms which you can't even substantiate.  the party will stop failing as soon as it realizes that people like you are only looking to divide not unite. that was the biggest failing in 2016. 
4886,4896,1,such bittersweet. oh things that could have been.
4887,4897,1,"damn, boy, you sure have a lot of free time creating new accounts on reddit just so you can spit your bullshit.do something useful and go volunteer at hospital or care for elderly or something."
4888,4898,1,you and i are the only ones in this thread who read it.

4899,4909,1,"if the dems were filing this lawsuit for ""fundraising"" as many gop and trump apologists are claiming, then they would have filed it far earlier. this is about acting on all the information that has come out. dems don't need this lawsuit as a fundraising tool... going by the numbers, we can see that the dems are doing fine. as a party, it's about time the democrats stood up collectively against what happened."

5042,5053,1,"of course she did. or rather, the trump admin played the woman card on her behalf. but it's a huge false equivalence comparing her to hillary.  that's the problem right there. hillary owns the woman card because she deserves it... she's been fighting gender stereotypes her whole life.  applying the ""woman card"" to haspel isn't the same thing in any way and reinforces the ""vagina voting"" attacks.  haspel played the woman card as a last resort. that wasn't what hillary was doing. so let's not compare the two. are we going to accuse every female politician of using the ""woman card"" because she dares to stand up for issues affecting women?"

(""i supported hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. i didn't support palin cause she was a woman."") that means, that you supported clinton because of her ideas and not because of her being a women and you didn't support right-wing women because of their politics. thats exactly what bernie says (""being a latina is not enough"") but it still matters because ""we need 50 women in the senate. we need more african americans."".> so again, no one is saying that someone should be elected just because they're a woman or black or latino. only bernie is saying that.would have been a lot more time efficient for both of us if you had said that earlier.. > reduces his opponents to their identities. he did with hillarydo you have a quote?"

5102,5113,1,"i am becoming a bit concerned with the democratic congressional camapagin committee and it's consistent mistakes. the same time we know this election is a fundamental matter of life and death. we are facing the crisis that we do because republicans  have been highly disciplined and organized. the democratic cause in this moment requires us to do the same. we need to be long-term, strategic, well-financed and well-aligned. we also must act at the local, state and national levels simultaneously and in sync, resolute in each forum in which power is contested: redistricting, legislative action, electoral work, leadership development. we have finally seen that for too long up close what happens when that power is uncontested. most especially here in texas where its considerable damage to our state has lay bear. right-wing control in a majority of states most especially texas has been exploited to draw congressional and state legislative district lines that perpetuate minority voting power to lock in a distorted majority in the u.s. house of representatives and shut democrats out of meaningful presence in state houses. yet at this pivotal moment in time the democratic party seems to have a awkward and disjointed game plan on recruited candidates and electoral strategy. with the myriad of polling recently showing the liar and chief strengthening and democratic candidates generic ballot shrinking something is not aligned correctly.the democrats cannot reclaim power or leadership until we can give voice to the widespread economic insecurities felt throughout america and deliver!! lies  drew some voters, to a con artist lying bastard like trump. however they were effective in the first place because democrats failed to connect, but when the lies and bs implode like we have seen voters will not just vote for dems,  (again recent polling) unless they believe we can deliver and i'm afraid we are potentially screwing ourselves out of yet another election that is ours to win. this is just frustrating sorry for the rant."

5107,5118,1,im meh on her. if her dem rival wins then so be it. but im not big on these purity tests in the dem party and i think theyre pulling that on her. the reason people are for her is because she knows how to play politics and get shit done. a newcomer may or may not be as effective.

5202,5213,1,"again, you're purposely refusing to see my point. where did i say minimum wage helps white people more? please point that out. i'm clearly saying that bernie approaches it from one angle. he doesn't see that there are nuances affecting economic equality issues that concern race and gender. and to top it all, when he puts economic issues above social and civil rights issues, it's even more alienating to non-white voters. living wage is definitely important but if you're a minority, you're more concerned about getting the job or having the same opportunity for the job as everyone else. bernie's economics don't factor those issues. and if he cared so much about economic equality, then why hasn't he advocated more against voter suppression?he refuses to discuss race and gender in terms of economics when it obviously plays a huge part. that's why his agenda is narrow and wwc specific."
5203,5214,1,"i would never argue she made no mistakes.in fact, i can list a few more.:pnow the question is: can you admit bernie made a huge mistake too?the key moment in 2016 was imo the morning after bernie lost the ca primary.you may remember that rather dramatic moment. the whole press and every politically interested man/ woman was waiting for him to admit defeat, endorse hillary and go to work.not with a huge chip on his shoulder but enthusiastically.he didnt.instead he spoke about how he'd still win, and launched a huge attack on both hillary and the dnc.he continued that for 5 full weeks afterwards.those 5 weeks are key. they gave us a time period in which bernie and trump double teamed in their attacks on hillary.he created an illusion among his followers he could still win the primaries (which he couldnt) making their disappointment bigger and bigger.and then we saw the melodrama at the convention where bernies supporters (not all but a lot) behaved like complete and total scum.booing john lewis? booing the mothers of the movement?booing any poc they could?sitting there with their mouths taped and playing the spoiled disgusting drama queens they were?the months afterwards, i made the silly decision to start working for our revolution as a kind of peace offering. i worked on the campaigns of jayapal and teachout.not a single fucking berner wanted to work on those campaigns, instead they obsessed over wikileaks and their immature hatred of the woman that won and the dem party.on the day before the election i wrote a deeply felt passionate plea to the bernie subs here on reddit begging them to vote for hillary.if not for themselves, for minorities, for women, children, muslims, poc, lgtb.i warned them how much trump would hurt us.i was laughed at, yelled at, scorned and ridiculed by the entitled, privileged scumbags who call themselves bernieorbusters.and now, we see everything happen that hillary and we warned for.women, poc, lgtb, children are hurting. and you or any other bernie supporter who voted for hillary are ok, but do not question that :yes bernie did enormous damage to hillary's campaign.he should have campaigned for her from the ca primary on. should not have taken a leave to write his damn book and most of all: he should have addressed his spoiled privileged supporters not once but over and over again to talk some sense into them about wikileaks, russian meddling (bots promoting bernie) and so on and on.and jane sanders should go to hell for her tweet when bernie endorsed hillary and told his supporters to vote for her, they shouldnt always follow/ do what bernie told them to."
5204,5215,1,"yeah, ive addressed that."
5205,5216,1,"yes, i'm breaking a rule of this sub but to make a valid point. hillary was right! which we know but it just feels like an appropriate time to start shouting it. with putin lying about her today in a broadcast viewed world wide, i feel this is necessary.from this article:>""its pretty clear you wont admit that the russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the united states of america, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up nato, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race,"" clinton said to trump at the third presidential debate in october.i'm not on twitter but if it's not already out there, please feel free to use #hillarywasright or a version of it."
5206,5217,1,i love hillary but we really dont need her losing to trump a second time. i think we desperately need someone younger. we need someone who isnt a baby boomer. 
5207,5218,1,"its sad that you you look at race and gender before you have empathy for human suffering.  a homeless white man is not living in any sense of privilege, period.  when you hit the bottom you hit the bottom.your logic is flawed.  you dont have to do or say something for another human to say or do something racist or sexist to you.  racism and sexism is prejudice, meaning to judge a priori.  if we were to use your logic a person could say african americans must have done something to get shot by police over and over again police just dont shoot if theres not a good reason. or someone must have done something horrible for white nationalists to protest in charlottesville.please dont make any assumptions about the way i vote either, i know you werent in the voting booth with me.  if you have to shame people to vote for your candidates then your candidates are not worth being on the ballot.what did i post here thats racist or sexist? is that really where you are taking this now. "
5208,5219,1,"so what youre saying is we shouldnt address misogyny, civil rights, lgtb rights and so on because trump voters see that as identity politics?we cant even discuss those issues here because that may drive away voters?why dont we all just join the gop, saves time"

5213,5224,1,"given the people standing up for her reputation and the timing of these attacks, i want to give her the benefit of doubt. the fbi are also investigating so there's that as well.  it's incredibly difficult to believe the extremities of these attacks against especially for anyone who's familiar with her work and reporting.

5456,5468,1,"if this is paywalled for you:**israeli intelligence firms election-meddling analysis comes under muellers scrutiny***psy-group presentation outlines ways trump campaign was helped by fake social media accounts*by byron tau and  rebecca ballhausspecial counsel robert muellers investigators have obtained a presentation prepared by an israel-based private intelligence firm that outlines ways in which donald trumps 2016 election was helped by fake news and fake social-media accounts, according to people familiar with the presentation and documents reviewed by the wall street journal.mr. muellers interest in the presentation suggests his investigation is focusing on the role of social-media manipulation during the 2016 campaign. intelligence officials have said that cyber-influence campaigns, sometimes covertly sponsored by foreign governments, are expected to become a major part of political campaigning in the coming years.the presentation consists of nine slides and was prepared by the psy-group, a firm that boasts of ties to elite israeli intelligence agencies. it isnt clear who received the psy-group presentation, but it appears to have been created sometime after the 2016 election.people familiar with the presentation describe it as an internal analysis drawn up by the firm to drum up u.s. political businesssaying that it was essentially used as marketing material for the firms operation and analytical capabilities. it also represents a proof of concept of how a firm like psy-group would have manipulated the 2016 campaign as well as future campaigns, people said.it is unclear how much of the presentation consists of the firms analysis of online activity during the campaign and how much is a hypothetical pitch.marc mukasey, a lawyer for mr. zamel, said the presentation copy that mr. mueller has obtained was a sample type analysis of what they could do.a spokesman for mr. mueller declined to comment.the presentation outlines the ways in which social media bots and fake online content were used to help energize voters supportive of mr. trump. one slide entitled trump campaign components outlines a timeline where fake news sites/avatars/content were created during the early part of the election year and then leveraged to spread uncertainty by midyear. the final stage was using fake bots to react to real life situations & further polarize the ta, or target audience, the slide says.another slide says the firm identified 140 pro-trump websites linked to a man in macedonia. the websites had american-sounding domain names such as worldpoliticus.com and published aggressively pro-trump content aimed at conservatives and trump supporters in the usa. worldpoliticus.com is no longer active.a person familiar with trump campaigns operations said it has absolutely no knowledge of what this firm was referring to in the slideshow.another slide outlines a facebook strategy where fake online profiles or avatars engage real people online and encourage them to share content. the result is a multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies, the slide says.in september, facebook disclosed that it identified about 500 inauthentic accounts with ties to russia that bought $100,000 worth of ads during a two-year period encompassing the presidential campaign.mr. mueller is investigating whether anyone in the trump campaign colluded in russian efforts to interfere in the election. moscow has denied meddling and mr. trump has denied any collusion by his campaign.the psy-groups founder, joel zamel, is under scrutiny from u.s. investigators because of his close relationship with the government of the united arab emirates and his involvement in a meeting with mr. trumps eldest son shortly before election day, the journal has reported.mr. zamel met with donald trump jr. at trump tower in the weeks before the 2016 election along with george nader, a top adviser to the crown prince of the united arab emirates, to discuss an offer to help boost the campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. erik prince, a u.s. defense contractor who specializes in the middle east and had close ties to the campaign, attended the meeting, the journal previously reported. people involved in the meeting say nothing came of it and the psy-group didnt perform any work for the trump campaign.a lawyer for mr. trump jr. said messrs. zamel and nader had pitched his client on a social media platform or marketing strategy and that he was not interested and that was the end of it.the presentation reviewed by the journal wasnt related to the trump tower meeting nor was it prepared for mr. nader, said mr. mukasey, mr. zamels attorney.mr. mueller has been investigating mr. zamels work and has interviewed mr. zamel about his business relationship with mr. nader, according to people familiar with the matter. mr. mukaseyhas said investigators have told him his client isnt a target of the probe. a subpoena concerning mr. zamels work, but not issued to mr. zamel, was reviewed by the journal.mr. nader has been cooperating with investigators since january, when investigators stopped him at dulles airport and served him with a subpoena.a lawyer for mr. nader said his client has fully cooperated with the special counsels investigation and will continue to do so. the lawyer declined to answer further questions.the psy-group was formed by mr. zamel, the son of an australian mining magnate who moved to israel to study counterterrorism. there, mr. zamel founded several companies beginning in 2010 and became increasingly close to the government of the u.a.e., the journal has previously reported. one of his companies, wikistrat, did war games and analysis for the u.a.e. in 2014 and say he was close to the national security adviser there, according to people familiar with mr. zamel.people familiar with the psy-groups operations say it provided intelligence services for political and corporate clients.after the 2016 election, the firm started to pitch for business in the u.s., including for the 2018 midterms. as part of its pitch to potential political clients, the psy-group said it had the capability of leveraging fake social-media accounts, which they call avatars, on behalf of political campaigns.psy excels at the use of online avatars that appear natural, unbiased and object. these avatars are highly effective at directing political messaging to target audiences, marketing materials reviewed by the journal say. these fake social accounts could be used for narrative warfare or to echo campaign messaging, the firm said.no political entity has made any payments to the psy-group since 2015, according to federal election commission records. the participation of foreign firms or individuals in u.s. elections is tightly controlled."

5465,5477,1,"i can only imagine what he thinks of the americans who fall for trump's obvious childish bullshit.he probably thinks them as being so stupid that they would vote for such a lying blabbering idiot who has one possible (non)qualification, he's rich - but then, only take his word for it."
5466,5478,1,hillary looks amazing
5467,5479,1,"is she picturing a dodge minivan when she hears ""caravan""?"
5468,5480,1,"while i find this type of map interesting, i wish it accounted for population density/total number of votes rather than just who ""won"" and by what percentage.  here, a rural precinct with 25 voters total that covers a vast area is visually much more striking than a tiny city precinct with a hundred times as many voters.  if trump got 20 votes and clinton got 5 in a huge precinct, that's a lot of dark red splashed across the map.  and given that the electoral college is based on vote totals for the entire state (with slight exceptions in ne and me), it doesn't actually matter how many precincts each candidate won.i wish this were set up like the [population dot map](https://demographics.virginia.edu/dotmap/) so that all those huge areas in the midwest and west where no one lives would look like no one lives there.  i also don't get why maine has large blank white spaces where there are no voters and therefore no precincts, but other similarly rural states have similarly unpopulated areas colored in."
5469,5481,1,"meaningless, and she knows it.every judge on trump's list has been vetted hard on this issue by the federalist society. that's part of how they got on the list! they would not be there if they hadn't made it abundantly clear how eager they are to undo roe.she has to reject any nominee from trump who does not explicitly promise to uphold roe. that should be the test."
5470,5482,1,"i was about to yell at you thinking she was like 55. but she'll be over 70. i don't really care about age but i could understand the desire for younger blood. for me, i just don't want to see her brand of populism. she's right about a lot of economic issues but she also grand stands. i don't think she can be impartial when it comes to considering sensible legislation. if it a law even happens to benefit a bank or insurance company in anyway she will be obliged to blast it. and who knows where she will land on the us military. i can't envision her ever giving a tough military order. at least trump knows to basically stay out of it. he talks and talks, but no one at pentagon is listening. that's scary for all sorts of other reasons, but a more attached president would have had a major showdown with military brass by now. i'd be interested to hear what she says about handling military. maybe i'm wrong."
5471,5483,1,i hope that this is finally the tipping point for this country. trump is putins lap dog.

5476,5488,1,i just wish she were president :(  these two years have just been awful.
5477,5489,1,"clearly not, but it is a politician's job. you see racists and i see failed human potential, you seem angry but you should really be saddened. hate doesn't beat hate, only love can do that. you can stay angry, talking about how horrible ""the other"" is in your little hillary bubble if you want, but why...?"
5478,5490,1,"> ofc that had a huge impact especially on undecided voters.definitely. especially given the timing... comey deflected attention from the ha tape... and then add in effect of the voter suppression in a swing state like wisconsin... the numbers add up. she lost by 80,000 votes in areas impacted by all of these factors. it's about time the msm and the loud minority stop trying to shut up the majority."
5479,5491,1,its ground work. its much easier to indict someone (say a president) when youve already proved a a conspiracy exists.
5480,5492,1,huh?
5481,5493,1,i dont know about that. i didnt vote for bernie in the primary. and a lot of what you said is true. but i dont see it as his fault. he wasnt the one claiming it was rigged. it was people like his jack ass campaign manager who complained about it being rigged. i like that bernie is a senator and he has a more important voice than he did. i do hate the nasty rhetoric against hillary to this day and will follow us until after she dies. but as leslie knope said in 2010 hillary is the biggest punching bag in america 
5482,5494,1,"when it comes to joy reid, i'm not surprised at all if the campaign is coming from the bernie left because she's been one of the few ""msm"" personalities who's made it a point to continuously call out sanders, especially on twitter, and it triggers his extreme supporters. i think we need to now say that this isn't ""in-fighting"" anymore. the kind of people who are attacking her and many other women and poc on twitter aren't on the same page as other democrats. they're separate.

5586,5598,1,"i wouldnt hesitate to tell him exactly why you cant support him.i've done that before, i think it's important candidates know that by going the bernie way they alienate the real base of the party."
5587,5599,1,deeply flawed candidate
5588,5600,1,are you missing the point that right now being a good leader and standing up for democrat policies is hand in hand with opposing trump? so you want democrats to talk about their policies while pretending that trump isn't destroying the country? this is the same bullshit that got trump elected. you don't like the message so you pretend there's none and let people like trump get away with their shit. fuck this shit.

5590,5602,1,"like it or not it's our political climate and voters have a responsibility to vote for someone whether they feel inspired or not. and if they're not inspired, they should vote for a candidate that can handle the office and won't do harm to the country and its citizens. so yes voter shaming is ok because voters heavy duty, they have a responsibility, if they choose not to act that in of itself is negligence"
5591,5603,1,how come they dont link these documents or even say how they got them?
5592,5604,1,">if you didnt know nixon had been a hillary supporter in the primaries, you sure couldnt tell from her newly minted identity as a bold progressive who accused her opponent andrew cuomo of not being a real democrat. she described how like so many others she had been inspired by bernie sanders revolutionary, people-powered campaign. her criticisms of cuomo are stuffed with triggers like ultra rich donors, her platform reads like a xerox of sanders 2016 positions, and just in case you still were wondering about her revolutionary creds, she has sprinkled the p-word generously throughout her tweets, making sure that despite her earlier support of hillary and her own wealth and fame, she doesnt give off the deadly whiff of **establishment** bo.>with such aggressive self-branding, its no surprise that bernie bros adore nixon (one describes having a similar feeling watching her speak as he had watching bernie) and many hillary-supporters felt betrayed (i was going to vote for you, but not now! never!) the twitter-storm that followed the our revolution announcement was fiercely divisive, and for me, brought on a case of political ptsd. again? **have the democrats learned nothing?**>nixons tarring of cuomo as not a real democrat was particularly chilling for me, as i got to thinking about that january day before the new hampshire primary, and the speech in which bernie sanders charged hillary clinton, for the first (but hardly the last) time, of not being **a real progressive**, while hundreds of young people booed her and cheered him....>since then, despite all the talk of needing to unify and heal divisions, **the branding of democrats into progressive and establishment** (or sometimes, centrist) **has come to dominate how candidates are identified**and often self-identifyas with cynthia nixon....>bernie did undeniable damage in the democratic presidential primary by framing the contrast between him and hillary as the progressive versus the establishment. and we just keep it going by framing future democratic contests that way."
5593,5605,1,"anything other than the cataclysmic failure that is the trump administration, thats what theyre talking about. "
5594,5606,1,"unfortunately, his supporters are not all uneducated. i have colleger-educated family & friends that still support trump. i personally don't understand why. i can't even discuss politics with them anymoreit's like they're in a cult. even when i supported my democratic presidents, i didn't agree w/ them 100% on everything they did. i was critical of some policies & legislation. that's why trumpsters are a cult, because they are 100% in. they have absolutely nothing critical to say about him."
5595,5607,1,"oh give me a break. stalin poisoned lenin. duh, everyone knows that. stalin poisoned everyone. "
5596,5608,1,"they think if it is good for them it is good for the country. money, money, money, and more money. sadly, it is a big game to them and trump is one of them through and through."

5604,5616,1,nice try.
5605,5617,1,that's sad.  i didn't agree with a lot of bush's policies but at least he and barbara seemed like genuinely nice and caring people.  
5606,5618,1,when did she lie?
5607,5619,1,"national polls may be accurate, but they don't matter.  see: 2016.if 100% of californians vote against trump, it won't matter any more than if 50.00001% vote against him.if 50.0001% of floridians vote for trump, it's as if 100.0000000000% have voted for him.also, 90% of republicans are happy with trump.  that means 99.99% will vote for him because they understand what party loyalty means and the importance of voting.electoral college.  gerrymandered districts.  what ""most"" americans want (spread across all states) is irrelevant.this is why we need to 1) swing the ""undecided"" voters (in quotes, because i really don't get how someone could be in this day) and 2) get out the vote."
5608,5620,1,">  i don't see the democrats getting people excited about any sort of platform other than, ""not trump."" yet democrat voter turnouts for the primaries have been significantly higher than past elections and it certainly has not been all about anti-trump so it seems there are many people ""excited"" despite what you're trying to imply falsely."
5609,5621,1,right. my fear would have been that the republicans elected someone as corrupt or more corrupt than trump in 2020 but much more competent.
5610,5622,1,"if this is paywalled for you:**israeli intelligence firms election-meddling analysis comes under muellers scrutiny***psy-group presentation outlines ways trump campaign was helped by fake social media accounts*by byron tau and  rebecca ballhausspecial counsel robert muellers investigators have obtained a presentation prepared by an israel-based private intelligence firm that outlines ways in which donald trumps 2016 election was helped by fake news and fake social-media accounts, according to people familiar with the presentation and documents reviewed by the wall street journal.mr. muellers interest in the presentation suggests his investigation is focusing on the role of social-media manipulation during the 2016 campaign. intelligence officials have said that cyber-influence campaigns, sometimes covertly sponsored by foreign governments, are expected to become a major part of political campaigning in the coming years.the presentation consists of nine slides and was prepared by the psy-group, a firm that boasts of ties to elite israeli intelligence agencies. it isnt clear who received the psy-group presentation, but it appears to have been created sometime after the 2016 election.people familiar with the presentation describe it as an internal analysis drawn up by the firm to drum up u.s. political businesssaying that it was essentially used as marketing material for the firms operation and analytical capabilities. it also represents a proof of concept of how a firm like psy-group would have manipulated the 2016 campaign as well as future campaigns, people said.it is unclear how much of the presentation consists of the firms analysis of online activity during the campaign and how much is a hypothetical pitch.marc mukasey, a lawyer for mr. zamel, said the presentation copy that mr. mueller has obtained was a sample type analysis of what they could do.a spokesman for mr. mueller declined to comment.the presentation outlines the ways in which social media bots and fake online content were used to help energize voters supportive of mr. trump. one slide entitled trump campaign components outlines a timeline where fake news sites/avatars/content were created during the early part of the election year and then leveraged to spread uncertainty by midyear. the final stage was using fake bots to react to real life situations & further polarize the ta, or target audience, the slide says.another slide says the firm identified 140 pro-trump websites linked to a man in macedonia. the websites had american-sounding domain names such as worldpoliticus.com and published aggressively pro-trump content aimed at conservatives and trump supporters in the usa. worldpoliticus.com is no longer active.a person familiar with trump campaigns operations said it has absolutely no knowledge of what this firm was referring to in the slideshow.another slide outlines a facebook strategy where fake online profiles or avatars engage real people online and encourage them to share content. the result is a multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies, the slide says.in september, facebook disclosed that it identified about 500 inauthentic accounts with ties to russia that bought $100,000 worth of ads during a two-year period encompassing the presidential campaign.mr. mueller is investigating whether anyone in the trump campaign colluded in russian efforts to interfere in the election. moscow has denied meddling and mr. trump has denied any collusion by his campaign.the psy-groups founder, joel zamel, is under scrutiny from u.s. investigators because of his close relationship with the government of the united arab emirates and his involvement in a meeting with mr. trumps eldest son shortly before election day, the journal has reported.mr. zamel met with donald trump jr. at trump tower in the weeks before the 2016 election along with george nader, a top adviser to the crown prince of the united arab emirates, to discuss an offer to help boost the campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. erik prince, a u.s. defense contractor who specializes in the middle east and had close ties to the campaign, attended the meeting, the journal previously reported. people involved in the meeting say nothing came of it and the psy-group didnt perform any work for the trump campaign.a lawyer for mr. trump jr. said messrs. zamel and nader had pitched his client on a social media platform or marketing strategy and that he was not interested and that was the end of it.the presentation reviewed by the journal wasnt related to the trump tower meeting nor was it prepared for mr. nader, said mr. mukasey, mr. zamels attorney.mr. mueller has been investigating mr. zamels work and has interviewed mr. zamel about his business relationship with mr. nader, according to people familiar with the matter. mr. mukaseyhas said investigators have told him his client isnt a target of the probe. a subpoena concerning mr. zamels work, but not issued to mr. zamel, was reviewed by the journal.mr. nader has been cooperating with investigators since january, when investigators stopped him at dulles airport and served him with a subpoena.a lawyer for mr. nader said his client has fully cooperated with the special counsels investigation and will continue to do so. the lawyer declined to answer further questions.the psy-group was formed by mr. zamel, the son of an australian mining magnate who moved to israel to study counterterrorism. there, mr. zamel founded several companies beginning in 2010 and became increasingly close to the government of the u.a.e., the journal has previously reported. one of his companies, wikistrat, did war games and analysis for the u.a.e. in 2014 and say he was close to the national security adviser there, according to people familiar with mr. zamel.people familiar with the psy-groups operations say it provided intelligence services for political and corporate clients.after the 2016 election, the firm started to pitch for business in the u.s., including for the 2018 midterms. as part of its pitch to potential political clients, the psy-group said it had the capability of leveraging fake social-media accounts, which they call avatars, on behalf of political campaigns.psy excels at the use of online avatars that appear natural, unbiased and object. these avatars are highly effective at directing political messaging to target audiences, marketing materials reviewed by the journal say. these fake social accounts could be used for narrative warfare or to echo campaign messaging, the firm said.no political entity has made any payments to the psy-group since 2015, according to federal election commission records. the participation of foreign firms or individuals in u.s. elections is tightly controlled."

5650,5662,1,in a way itd be better for her to win after trump delivers congress to the democrats.   thats give her at least 2 years to create change. the house should go dem this year and maybe the senate but more likely in 2020.    i just wish her campaign ran better ads. show old white guys who used to hate her but then realized she was alright. show people whove known her their entire lives.  this time you could show trump voters saying how wrong they were. and get bill out there more!  its not too late. 
5651,5663,1,"of course it counts as prejudices and propaganda. women are literally never characterized as roguish, rebellious, or charming in a way that makes them good for presidency. when women are any of those things, that makes them sexually desirable at best (or more likely, sexually degenerate). when men are those things, they are lovable and trustworthy and you could have a beer with him, and of course you'll vote them for president. it's pure prejudice and propaganda.what we learned from the obama candidacy is that some of the older prejudices and propaganda about the president needing to be seen as a ""safe"" person have been eroded enough (due to numerous sex scandals) which made it okay for a black man to be voted in despite being seen as inherently threatening to white womanhood. (it helped that obama never shows anger or aggressiveness - he walked the tightrope well.) but the same sort of erosion had not yet occurred vis a vis the other group of prejudices that apply to women."

5663,5675,1,"sadly, i see a 50-50 vote on friday with pence being the tiebreaker.  i believe even worse things will come out as time goes on.  kav's writings indicate he believes the sitting president holds the mandate of heaven and he is both the beginning and the end of law in a country.protecting trump is the only thing that matters anymore.  let's say any evidence comes out trump was supported by the russian state directly.  it would implicate and destroy the entire republican party.  in order to preserve their power, they must destroy the country first.addendum (edit):  they could nominate anyone else.  i don't like gorsuch's overall policies too much, but i know he's not some sort of rapist and there is some comfort knowing a rapist is not a supreme court justice.  there are many ghouls in the conservative side but i would prefer them than a potential rapist such as kav any day of the week."

5679,5691,1,is this your standard response to anyone calling you out? if the party is failing it's because it's trying to accommodate people like you who can't even go beyond vague criticisms which you can't even substantiate.  the party will stop failing as soon as it realizes that people like you are only looking to divide not unite. that was the biggest failing in 2016. 
5680,5692,1,"any other candidate would have beaten trump. literally anyone. the conservatives have made her the boogie man. every single republican runs against her, not their opponent. you know what, they win. stop with this bullshit. as long as she keeps talking conservatives will be in power. end of story. she needs to fade away. edit: furthermore, i've never seen a woman despised by so many women. i think she would have been an amazing president but foxnews ran against her for 20 years and convinced so many people that she is the boogie man. they won, game over. time to move on.

5837,5850,1,it's not on twitter. they successfully silenced hillary supporters and continue to do so. telling people to get over it. better believe a lot of those are hired trolls.
5838,5851,1,seeing trump and putin on tv together at those podiums is making my stomach hurt.
5839,5852,1,">judge brett m. kavanaugh decided that to have any chance to reach the court, he would have to shed the pretense he was a fair-minded, calm, judicious thinker. **he came out in the afternoon filled with venom, screaming at the committee. his life was being ruined, he claimed. this was a clinton-like smear.** his anger was both **frightening and unexpected** if you thought he was that intellectual whom conservatives have swooned over. he yelled, and he cried. if you thought he was sincere, one could also appreciate how **partisan and emotional** he had become.>if president trump loved the nasty, male grievance game, the rest of us had reason to wonder if anyone of this temperament  cornyn, graham or kavanaugh  should be in a position of power. **if they were women, they would be called hysterical.**>the refusal to get the facts is both a telling admission of concern about what they would find and a violation the judicial goal of truth-seeking. its **a political calculation, exactly what you dont want to see from a judge**.>the worst moment was his confrontation with sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) who questioned him about blackout drinking. she explained that she understood alcohol abuse because her father was an alcoholic. have you ever blacked out? she asked. he sneered in response, have you? it was **a moment of singular cruelty and disrespect**. one saw a flash in the exchange with klobuchar the same **sense of entitlement, cruelty and lack of simple decency** that christine blasey ford allegedly experienced way back when, the memory seared in her brain of two obnoxious teens laughing at her ordeal.>kavanaugh says he was not the attacker. but even if you believe that  despite fords riveting testimony  one can reasonably conclude he is not the right person to sit on the court. **his anger toward liberals is palpable, his lack of humility bracing. he has the partisan mindset that opponents are unworthy of respect and kindness.**>... his heart is that of a **conservative partisan**, one who tried so very hard to make himself into supreme court material. the **mentality of a political operative**  willing to go on fox news, **ready to inflame passions, disrespectful toward opponents**  is still there. a nonpartisan would ask for, if not demand, an fbi investigation and judges appearance. kavanaugh wants to avoid both at all costs.>i believe dr. ford. but even if one does not, one can easily and firmly reach the conclusion **kavanaugh is far too partisan and angry to be on the supreme court.**"

5842,5855,1,"i understand - my point is, from what i've read, it doesn't deviate much from what was previously believed.  so, that's probably why i hasn't ignited much discussion here."

5850,5863,1,but if a democrat calls trump supporters stupid or 'deplorables' then all hell breaks loose.
5851,5864,1,"as an old white male, i truly believe trump and republican supporters are historically pathetic. they wreak of insecurity and ignorance. clearly just easily manipulated puke swallowing scared sheep."
5852,5865,1,because now they can pin it on trump and make him look bad. msm will run it like its trumps fault and the public will believe it.

5858,5871,1,"perhaps, but we put an absolute idiot in the oval office and people like devin nunes in congress, so i wouldn't discount the impact of other factors. it's very possible to be naive and succeed in a political competition. facts and well-thought out policy are vastly underappreciated or else hrc would be president right now. "
5859,5872,1,of course rbg will stick around.  once the dems are back in 2020 she will retire then (or stay on).  you are crazy if you think otherwise.
5860,5873,1,i'm white and going as michael jackson a skin tone alteration needed...i have to lighten my skin. hee hee!!
5861,5874,1,trump/bernie talk.the term identity politics in itself is racist af.
5862,5875,1,"agreed. i met hillary and bill when i was a kid. wonderful people. they took time out of their schedule to spend an afternoon with me, a terminally ill kid that wanted to meet his president. they were amazing. bill especially. "
5863,5876,1,"yes i'm not denying he said any of those things. but those words are not him supporting identity politics... in fact, he uses them as a basis for dismissing identity politics. i mean, he claims he wants to see more latinos and african americans in government but then he immediately dismisses their identity as a factor when in fact he should consider that their identity plays a big role in their politics. he assumes that this lady, just because she identifies as latino and is a woman, doesn't care about economic issues. that's his fallacy there - he can't see that someone who is a woman and a minority can also address economic issues.>and even though you dont like bernie, he is more in favour of women rights, than sarah palin would have been as vice-president... so clearly i have to agree: being black, a latina/-o or a women is not enough.why are you bringing up sarah palin like she's someone i'm using as a litmus test? again, this is the problem with bernie and his die-hards - he uses identity as a litmus test. i supported hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. i didn't support palin cause she was a woman. i don't admire condoleeza cause she was a woman. you guys need to stop conflating gender in this way and behaving like support for a woman or a minority is just down to the identity.and my problem with bernie is exavctly this - he rails against identity politics yet he's the one who reduces his opponents to their identities. he did with hillary and he's done it with other candidates he's run against in the past. and he's actively dismissed issues that concern women and minorities at the same time. so again, no one is saying that someone should be elected just because they're a woman or black or latino. only bernie is saying that."
5864,5877,1,yeah cause listening to someone else's interpretations singling out one person is a healthy take... where's jimmy dore' piece on bernie's anti-immigration votes and speeches? where is jimmy dore' piece on bernie literally dumping nuclear waste on minority texas towns? are you progressive or just pro-bernie?

5873,5887,1,"same.  i've been unable to sleep and have a knot in my stomach all the time.  and it's true, what do we do when our elected officials aren't trash?  the act itself is disgusting, what's scary is that people outside our own bubble support it.  not for nothing, but i wonder do the folks who thought hillary and trump were the same still think that?  "
5874,5888,1,that is really not true in every part of the country.i expect her to endorse as she did with abrams and cuomo when she thinks it will help and stay out of races when it might hurt.
5875,5889,1,"unfortunately, it's coming from the racist faction in this country  whose flames have been fanned by the greasy human shitbag in the wh."
5876,5890,1,"this is so infuriating especially when i have to keep reading whiney posts from bernie bros about how unfairly the media treated him (bullshit).out of the entire conversation between chimamanda and hillary, this is the headline cnn came away with:""why is nigerian author chimamanda upset with hillary clinton?""https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/24/africa/chimamanda-adichie-hillary-clinton-wife-africa/index.htmlwhich is complete bullshit. i watched the discussion and this is a such a misrepresentation of it. and of course they don't even bother to cover the rest of the conversation that was so much more than this - it was such a nuanced and in depth conversation but of course all of that is ignored."
5877,5891,1,"for starters, the judge wouldn't blame it on a political party."
5878,5892,1,and he's given them the courage to be horrible people.  perhaps the single thing that bothers me the most about all of this.his supporters are a cult.  it's that simple. 
5879,5893,1,"the good news is that his support seems to be dwindling (yes, yes, yes...i know all about that stupid poll that you guys clutch to like trump does to the electoral map), and our rev endorsed candidates are getting beat in every important election, but if you want an honest answer, yes we need to take him/them seriously because they're still buying into his nonsense. you're proof of that.bernie will run in 2020 because of his massive ego, and it's an easy way to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars from poor people to him and his cronies. i mean, hillary broke her arm several weeks ago when she accidentally stepped between bernie and a microphone. so, let's assume he is. he will probably win iowa because white people and caucuses. he will win nh because he's from a neighboring state. then what happens in nevada? that will be interesting, and where bernie supporters lost their minds in 2016. who comes out of the first 3 to challenge bernie? then supertuesday and the southern primaries. this is when bernie got crushed, and was basically mathematically eliminated. of course, he didn't want to do the honorable thing, and concede. no, he wanted to stay in, so he could milk as much money out of you suckers for as long as possible. it worked! bernie won 4 out of 13 states, with 2 being caucuses (of course) and 1 his home state. but now we have included california! so, does harris run, and win california and most of the southern states? that could be a big blow to saint bernard. once again, getting crushed by dems most reliable voting block - black women. if she doesn't run, does cali give bernie a huge boost? could happen.does bernie win enough delegates early because of the other dems splitting the votes, so he can win - just like trump? does the dems concede early, so that doesn't happen? does someone come out of nowhere to take it like often happens?do dems challenge bernie, and does he actually get vetted by the media and his opponents? does biden run to save the dems from bernie and trump? who knows, but yes i think it would be a mistake to ignore bernie, and treat him with kid gloves like last time.... "
5880,5894,1,"i know that is technically the baby boomer years but it is bullshit. with the range of years that wide, baby boomers could have had children that were also baby boomers. logic and reason bring you to the conclusion that you cannot be the same generation as your own child.  i don't accept the 1960's births as baby boomers. "
5881,5895,1,he's cracking out the hold hits for midterms.
5882,5896,1,"people think the republican party was hijacked by racists and anti-semites. the truth is most of the republican voters have always been these things, they finally have representatives that truly represent who they are. moderates and independent voters need to step up and vote against the hate group. "
5883,5897,1,"i am still a scientist, and i can tell you that media talking about science is always a little iffy. however, you didnt use some trusted media source that has issues understanding complex topics. you used the national review. the national review is not even a source you should use to other conservatives. might as well be using fucking breitbart or infowars. also, you ignored every part of my statement. my statement wasnt saying there was a right or wrong answer to anything (although there factually is), just that the opinions of republican politicians  all appear to be minority opinions. and they are. based on all of my sources. that are actual polls. based in actual fact. i am in this community and i support democrats because i support actual facts with proof. not some shit that national review can scrape off the road and act like is fact.

5891,5905,1,"yeah, and i hate to say it but i feel like it might be worth it to have a safe white dude that's not entrenched in everything.  :/  i think part of the reason people really liked barack obama (and bernie, to be fair) was that he didn't have all the baggage from decades of being associated with the party and the clintons and whatnot.  that's not to say that i think all that stuff is valid in the slightest.  i just want 2020 to be as ironclad as possible and it would be great if the dems would start looking outside the tiny circle that it seems like they have blinders towards.

5893,5907,1,"my career's in tech infrastructure and security (more infra than security, but i'm not ignorant), so that's where my perspective is focused here.would there be direct evidence?  in a well-run setup, possibly. depends on how good the hackers were.in almost any of these setups?  fuck no.  all the circumstantial evidence others are complaining about is *probably* the best the public's gonna get.  i can't speak to legal status, but in the tech world, the evidence michael harriot laid out in this piece is more than enough to answer the kinds of questions we tend to have.  those questions boil down to essentially one:given the available metadata (logs, audit trails, system monitoring histograms, diffs between backups and live data, etc), *can we trust that this system wasn't tampered with*?that question itself is generally made up of two smaller ones:  what *do* we know? and what *can* we know?  i almost started basically typing out the article in my own words, but i'll skip that part.  between how badly-secured these systems were (both design and implementation, and all the way from end-user to database backends), how badly audited and logged they were, and how badly backups were kept (if any), i think most competent professionals would generally agree on these points:* we know attackers gained access to live voting systems/databases* we know end-user voting machines are embarrassingly easy to gain access to.* due to bad security practices of many kinds, and in at least one case deliberate deletion of backups, *it is not possible* to verify whether or not data was changed in many of these cases.in the computer security world, if you can't verify something, being thorough means you must assume the worst-case scenario.  how you deal with it depends a lot on context but to stay focused: this means that we as technical professionals *must* assume rolls and votes were tampered with.the malfeasance and incompetence continually demonstrated over the course of the last two decades or so of modern electronic voting in the us has the general public in a position where anyone with a strong enough political lean can accept or dismiss the available data as they wish.  the pattern-matcher in me wants to think that's on purpose but that's neither here nor there.as an industry expert, the 'case' presented in this article is highly convincing.  ""can we trust that these systems were not tampered with?""  no, full stop.  will we ever have *direct* evidence that votes were changed? given the mismanagement involved, i very strongly doubt that.  is that enough for a legal case? i have no idea. if i were brought in to fix the situation? this is more than enough."
5894,5908,1,because she's a brilliant senator who spent years fighting for women/ lgtb and because she's a really strong advocate for gun control and so on.because she kicked ass with releasing the gps transcripts.because we value the representation of women in politics.unless she resigns there's no reason whatsoever to replace her with some dude.and fyi: just because i posted a link here doesnt mean this sub backs her.

6023,6038,1,here's one for the history books: https://i.redd.it/d0ovqecxfuo11.png
6024,6039,1,im confused. what do you mean?
6025,6040,1,i don't get why the left loves her so much. pretty rich coming from somebody in a coalition with the far right
6026,6041,1,um what? so just because someone is racist means that all people of that race should be held responsible? 
6027,6042,1,"that's completely intentional.  destroy the institutions of american democracy from many angles, including by not having anyone to actually ensure it."
6028,6043,1,president corrupto mcpantsonfire is a hot mess.  so distract watchers by going back to an old favorite target.  classic.  
6029,6044,1,"she knew and called it all. too bad the media spend this time showing trump's fucking podium and having 18 people on the screen at once to yell at each other about trump instead of cover her damn speeches and policy positions.cnn is desperately trying to redeem itself, but the damage is done. they can pretend to be as anti-trump as they want, they helped make this monster."
6030,6045,1,"i mean... donna brazile literal response to warren's comments was to clarify that it wasn't rigged.>brazile: i don't think she meant the word rigged, because what i said, george, as you well know, after i left this show back on july 24th, i said i would get to the bottom of everything. and that's what i did. and i called senator sanders to say, you know, i wanted to make sure there was no rigging of the process. i'm on the rule and bylaws committee. i found no evidence, none whatsoever."
6031,6046,1,wow.
6032,6047,1,"the rate that the republican party goes to bat for sex offenders is astonishing. it's like several times a year that the entire conservative apparatus is activated to defend one of these cretins. and every time they do the same song and dance: blame the victims. ""just ask questions."" blame the democrats for  exposing the rapist. all the while the try desperately to look the other way while handing over ungodly power to him."
6033,6048,1,"it doesn't matter what group or what label you identify cortez as... what matters are her issues and that's where you've tried to conveniently cherry-pick issues that you think align her with sanders and against clinton... but you clearly are quite misinformed about clinton's platform and issues or you're intentionally trying to mislead just like you did with your comment about bernie's take on identity politics.>she supports single-payer health care, tuition-free college, ending private prisons, and clean campaign financing. these are some of her main policy positions, none of which hillary clinton supported and all of which bernie supported.hillary wasn't against single payer healthcare. she was just against bernie's plan. her plan built towards it.she supported tuition-free college, ending private prisons and definitely for campaign finance reform.  and by the way, one of cortez's big issues is criminal justice reform which was also hillary's. not bernie's. and also paid family leave. again, another main issue on hillary's platform. not bernie's.it's really amazing that you have no clue about someone you're attacking in this way. doesn't matter if you're a marxist or whatever... at least you should know what you're talking about instead of outright lying. unless you yourself don't know these facts and if that's  the case then please educate yourself.>do you remember the bankruptcy bill? hillary flipped on that hardcore. there's her record on banks in a nutshell.again, i'm going to ask about how much you know about this apart from the surface level knowledge you're exhibiting.  if you wanna talk about the bankruptcy bill as an example of her track record then why don't you discuss the intricacies of her vote:https://medium.com/@zacharyleven/the-case-for-hillary-3564233d524fhave a read. it might be informative especially if you think that's her record on banks in a nutshell. you clearly have a lot of information gaps.so again, it doesn't matter whether cortez is dsc or you're a marxist... it matters about the issues and about being honest about issues which you are not. at the end of the day, you're hurting yourself with this kind of dishonesty."
6034,6049,1,"it is already awkward because our president an anti-semite, and it is awkward to celebrate anything knowing that.https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/lets-settle-the-debate-donald-trump-is-an-anti-semite/"
6035,6050,1,"yes. if we peel off a voter from the republicans, that affects the dem-gop margin by two. if dems mobilize someone who has never voted before to vote for democrats, that just affects it by one.in any case, i dont think we are far enough ahead in the polls to be able to say if you apologize for and recant everything youve ever publicly written, we will consider allowing you to vote for and endorse us."

6039,6054,1,">  do you think a woman like her would have elected senator twice, run for the nomination in2008 when she lost by a 1% (she probably won the popular vote) and then run again and win handily if she didn't have the skills suited for the ""bully pulpit""?do you think a person like her would have been elected senator twice if she didn't have intimate access to a former 2-term potus's rolodex, staff, and list of favors to call in -- such as making sure the other primary candidates in the blue state to which she had just moved, withdrew before she entered? and... she won ""handily"" in 2016? yes i am afraid we are operating from different dimensions.for the record though, i do assume there would be ""this partisan politics at play,"" not sure why anyone thinks that would have evaporated. i did agree were she elected it would be vastly preferable to what we have now, that's why i voted for her in november and urged my peers to do the same. but with an ability to pursue her own agenda? don't see how.the more *left* populists like osc win, the more people recognize they *can* win and succeed that way, until even the party can't fail to recognize it. and it'd be nice to bury ""socialist"" as a slur that can be used against any garden-variety liberal, by showing ""socialists"" (social democrats really) are popular."
6040,6055,1,i'm suspicious voters were either changed or thrown out.
6041,6056,1,"if you're not ready to look beyond your own race/ life and vote to protect vulnerable people, you're not a progressive, period.again: i do not believe people just called you racist/ sexist out of the blue, instead of as reaction to your own behavior.if i judge from the posts you make here, i can certainly see why people would call you racist/ sexist.and entitled didnt address your race/color but your sense people have to earn your vote, or else..interesting though that you immediately connect that to the color of your skin...if youre not willing to vote out a president who threatens democracy, the free press, our judiciary system and so on, but instead claim the dems need to do this or that or else, there's nothing progressive or leftish about you.and fyi: even the poorest, lowest white man is still privileged versus women and poc."

6062,6077,1,"based on your comment history...  i believe it's you that hasn't the slightest clue what you're talking about.  why do i say that?  because the above response you have is used over and over by you with zero substance behind your statement each time.i know forming a thought beyond, ""trump supporters are nazi racist morons"", is tough for you.  but, maybe one day you'll realize that in order to have an actual discussion with adults you'll have to come up with multiple thoughts and put sentences together to backup your opinions."
6063,6078,1,"nobody is telling you what you should be concerned about. i'm telling you what i am concerned about, which is the left devolving into a competing tapestry of identity interest groups without any synergy, which is precisely what you are doing when you label me a ""white guy"", imply that i am ""telling [you] what [you] should be concerned about"", and assuming that i ""get mad at women for 'leading men on'"".actually, i'm extremely familiar with the problems that aggressive male sexual behaviour cause for women. i've listened to my partner describe harassment on the street and in public locations by men on a daily and weekly basis for as long as i have known her. the real question is how to improve the situation, and while i don't have a firm answer for that i know that addressing the question will be ten times harder with a republican president, house, and senate. by driving people away from voting democratic because they see us as a minority-interests voting bloc obsessed with identity politics we are, in the long run, preventing these issues from being addressed."

6345,6361,1,">  because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. no, where do you read that out? it says, that not everyone who is from a minority is automatically progressive. thats why i gave you some examples, almost no left-leaning liberal would prefer a female/latina/black republican over a male/white/heterosexual (progressive) democrat. >  because the way you're presenting his words is that progressiveness according to bernie doesn't include the concerns of racial and gender minorities. it might be that he thinks a lot more in terms of class than other politicians do (if they do it at all) because he says he is a socialist. but still he made clear quite a lot that racial and gender justice is really important (to him).> bernie didn't even consider the politics and focused on gender and race as a negative.come on.. i am pretty sure bernie knew hillary clinton from their time in senate together.. > maybe he should have asked the woman what her politics were before reducing her chances because she represented herself as a latina woman.he could have done that. but i don't know the centext.. i have searched for quite a bit but didn't found an article with the full question but i found one with the full (long) answer. yes, he could simply have asked what she wants to change or whats to do and when she replied he could than have said ""okay, thats great"" or ""yeah, thats not enough"". but what he could also have done is say that it is really important go get enough minoritiy candidates into politics but they also have to be progressives. i don't see a problem there. (even tough his statement beginns with ""let me respond to the question in a way you may not be happy with"", so its probably more than ""i want to be the first latina.."" but a real question)> you're the one, like bernie, assuming things in a very arrogant way and reducing everything to identity politics as a negative thing.where am i beeing very arrogant? and where am i reducing identity politics as a negative thing?> i mean bernie called her unqualified and his campaign manager branded her ""ambitious"" because she wanted to run for president.bernie replied to her, when she said that bernie didnt do his homework and that doesnt understand how to break up big banks and voters should ask themselves if he can deliver what he promises. then bernie just replied ""theyre going to question my qualifications, so i am questioning theirs."" and he repeated the same in a debate (""you might wonder about your qaulifications madame secretary"". and then he said why he is questioning them: iraq war, trade agreements, super pacs, wall street. yes, this might be a bit childish (bernie said that ""we"" shouldnt get into that tit-for-tat) but i dont think its sexist. it is basically ""being a women is not enough"" because you have to stand up against big banks and not take their money. and the ""ambitious"" thing is actually another context.. but okay, i am not here to say that every member of the campaign is perfect. but its a bit far-fetched to say that bernie reduced clinton to her identity because his campaign manager says, that she has ambitions to be president... thats basically a fact for (nearly) every candidate.> he dismissed trump's attack on abortion rights as a distraction.no he said that this is shameful and its probably not against clinton but this would be against all women. a quote of the interview: ""maybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing america. donald trump will not look quite so interesting in that context."" he is not saying, that abortion rights are not important (which is insane to say if you know his voting record and his engagement for women rights.> and then there's his hardcore supporters coming after hillary supporters as vagina voters.and then there is the hardcore supporters of hillary coming after bernie supporters (but again bernie supporters /=/ bernie) who say that there is a special place in hell for women who dont support clinton. or that young women support bernie because they want to meet boys. or all the ""bernie bros"" that just support bernie because he is a man. > when he ran against a female governor of vermont he made it about her gender and how it would be sexist to vote for her because she was a womani dont know about the time, that was before i was born. what he said though is that many people are excited because she is a women but there is nothing more (because) he is the bigger feminist. i just dont know if that is true. but yeah, it would be sexist to vote for bernie if they just do it because he is a men. it is not (really) sexists to prefer a women over a men if you like them equally."

6357,6373,1,"no, i got that that's what you're saying. but think about the sorts of things a governor does. they create policy, they lobby legislators for that policy, they run the state government bureaucracy. things like that. there's a bunch of stuff _that does not actually require government office to have experience in._ likewise, holding elected office does not automatically grant you that kind of experience. for example, the mayor of new york or a few other cities might have handled running a similar bureaucracy... but legislators would not have that experience. there would be very few non-incumbents with that sort of experience, so it's a little ridiculous to expect it as a prerequisite for the same reason it's silly to expect ten years experience for an entry level job. nixon has run a multimillion dollar non-profit, though, so she does have executive experience. and her legislative experience is going to be about the same as a typical legislator, except that she doesn't get an actual vote and she doesn't get the paycheck."
6358,6374,1,"i think it was the media deciding to never ever cover hillary's policy proposals - something they have never done to a male candidate, just to her.great example being the foreign policy debate where the moderator used all clinton's time harassing her about the email-non-story and wouldn't actually let her talk about foreign policy.i don't see much reason to pretend it wasn't sexism."

6468,6484,1,"i love hillary, but i think she needs to go away. too divisive, unfortunately. (not because she is actually divisive herself, but between bernie fanatics, republicans, and russian trolls, plus a huge fraction of the american electorate is *really* stupid.)i actually feel the same about warrentheyve been working to smear her for years.and bernie, though im not much of a fan of his.i would vote for any of them in a general election, but id rather see harris or duckworth or someone else who the republican party hasnt yet demonized.and i think there should be plenty of good candidates, but now is not the time to worry about it. we need to push as hard as we can with the midterms and start worrying about 2020 next year."
6469,6485,1,"brent welder, lost his cool and started screaming at a hillary 2016 delegate who organized many events for all candidates, until she started crying and other people had to shield her from him.but please come tell me how these misogynist pricks want unity with ushttps://mobile.twitter.com/rachelgonkcmo/status/1027254957144203264"
6470,6486,1,"for sure.  from what i've read, many young people have never voted, not even registered...while this is in the uk, i agree with the thesis of this article:https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/08/young-people-vote-school-teach-politics-curriculum-electionwhile school teaches ""civics"" they don't teach the *truth* about how a bill becomes law (as in, [the 60 vote rule](https://www.quora.com/why-does-congress-need-60-yes-votes-to-pass-any-legislation) or how only bills which mitch mcconnell wants to pass go up for voting)"
6471,6487,1,"of course she did. or rather, the trump admin played the woman card on her behalf. but it's a huge false equivalence comparing her to hillary.  that's the problem right there. hillary owns the woman card because she deserves it... she's been fighting gender stereotypes her whole life.  applying the ""woman card"" to haspel isn't the same thing in any way and reinforces the ""vagina voting"" attacks.  haspel played the woman card as a last resort. that wasn't what hillary was doing. so let's not compare the two. are we going to accuse every female politician of using the ""woman card"" because she dares to stand up for issues affecting women?"

6522,6538,1,it's going to be bad when trump is not elected again and he doesn't want to leave.....
6523,6539,1,speaking out against putin and his destruction of democracy doesn't make nance or anyone part of any 'pro war propaganda machine'. ironic since your comment comes off as brainwashed propaganda. if anything greenwald is the one proving to be a cog in putin's pro war propaganda by sticking up for an authoritarian who has no regard for the rights of his own citizens and props up dictators and corrupt oligarchs globally.

6527,6543,1,are you bored and trolling seems a good idea?
6528,6544,1,"like the media, he responded to gops threats of getting smeared for doing his job.... so he didnt do his job and keep it quiet.  he didnt care if if later looked like he was helping trump though- by burying that investigation. "
6529,6545,1,it should be a warning sign that trump thought he was a good choice.
6530,6546,1,"this, exactly. clearly there is an enormous segment of people who think she's just the devil in a pantsuit. plus all the butthurt bernie bros (note: i mean just the crazies, not slandering everyone who supported him) who *still* claim that bernie would have won the primaries if the dnc hadn't interfered.honestly, for her to even say this right now is in really bad form. we need to begin to turn the tide on this government in the midterms, and anything that *anyone* on the left does to rile up the right is just fucking bad. whether we get the ""blue tide"" next week or not, we will still need to focus as much attention on congress in 2020 as on the white house, so we need a candidate in 2020 that the entire left can get behind. or at least as many of us as can ever be reasonable."
6531,6547,1,"republicans are the corporate party because they take corporate money. a good chunk of the democratic party also take corporate money. the difference is that usually all the republicans fall in line with the establishment so they can actually push through their gross agenda while the democrats are almost always split on every issue because half of them take so much money from the rich, so whatever gets done is an extremely watered down version of what the left actually wants. obamacare is a great example. what the left wanted was a single payer healthcare system, but obama (who was a great president don't get me wrong) didn't like negotiating, so he went right to the compromise which would have been a public option. republicans used this as an advantage by then making a compromise of the compromise: an individual mandate system which is the old-school republican idea.war is another great example. when obama took office, he didn't hold bush or the republicans accountable for entering a war with a country that didn't attack us. in fact, he expanded it by getting us into 7 interventions (trump got us into an 8th one). the most embarrassing one might've been when obama introduced gun reform and an incredibly watered down background check didn't even pass. republicans have taken the democrats shift to the middle as an opportunity to go extremely right-wing. this happened because democrats thought people would think the democrats would seem so much more reasonable by compromising, but humans are inherently tribalistic and many don't actually care about the policies, they care about their team winning. donald trump is a great example, who rallied against war in the primaries and republicans backed him up (nows he's super pro war and republicans are still backing him up because this is about ""yea that's my guy, that's my team, go us"" mentality). basically what i'm saying is that if democrats stop taking corporate money, real progressives will win primaries because they aren't facing up against fundraising (by the very wealthy) from the economically center right democrats and there will be more than just a few real progressive voices in congress. then i think we can finally work on getting money out of politics. i view getting money out of politics as endgame because republicans are really good at using their massive amount of money to advertise their policies that hurt the middle class to the middle class. (for example the estate tax was turned into the ""death tax"" because people went ""oh shit, i'm gonna die. i don't want that to happen to me"" when it only affects an incredibly small amount of people and their bratty kids still get loads of money. i didn't even know i had this much to say haha, but i'd like to hear your view on things. sorry if you read this to the end, cause wow that was a lot.

6564,6580,1,"im not sure american corporate media has been quite so nuanced in their distinction between the terms rigged, hacked, or influenced. in fact i think they have deliberately conflated these terms in the past to stir up viewership.when obama spoke to the people, he assured us our elections couldnt be messed with - call it rigging, influencing, hacking, or something else, but the bottom line is that he was quite confident it was impossible and told american voters so, while in private he knew that russians were in fact rigging/influencing/hacking. very dishonest.i think obama was so worried about trump erasing his legacy that he wasnt thinking ahead about his lies and how obvious they would be if trump siezed control of the federal government and uncovered his spying and dishonesty about election meddling."
6565,6581,1,excuse me... don't put words in my mouth. this is exactly the problem with you berners... you resort to this condescension and arrogance when you don't find people agreeing with you. y'all are not progressive - wanting everyone to agree with you is not progressive... it's entitlement.  you guys would rather fight people on your side than work towards something... how are you different from trump people? it's really sad you can't see beyond yourselves.

6567,6583,1,more like whining.
6568,6584,1,no shit.
6569,6585,1,kinda miss a big sub where we could all gather together and shoot the *suit*i posted my camping trip pics just for old times.
6570,6586,1,"his greatest slogan: ""yes we can"" was blatantly ripped from si se puede, which had been in use for a long time prior. i love the man, but his slogans are shit. stronger together was far better"
6571,6587,1,even you hillary haters cant be that blind to see the reality show unfolding our democracy. 
6572,6588,1,this kind of fraud should be grounds for impeachment
6573,6589,1,"maybe because of the ""black lives matter"" movement and the ""me too"" and the lgbt community always wanting to put themselves out there because they want to be.. oppressed? it's a weird thing, but i agree with trump. white men nowadays are looked at as ""privileged"" or a lesser person. black people can say cracker freely but if a white person says nigger they get beat up. if you really think that in today's world, white men, make sure theres a men there, are less oppressed than every other community. you are simply delusional."
6574,6590,1,"disappointing, but not surprising.  i can see the potential thought process, at least. if its something they hadnt had to think deeply about or experience for decades, even the most minor of inconveniences or pushbacks can seem like major attacks. personal experiences, however flawed, can overrule global truths if left unchecked (see also: people who claim wi-fi and wind turbines make them sick, and anti-vaxxers wholl ignore mountains of scientific evidence because their kid happened to get a little sick or got diagnosed with asd around the time of getting their vaccines)"
6575,6591,1,"she's not a moderate candidate at all. even you can't actually point out actual reasons why moderates would support her. being ""anti-trump"" is not the  standard for moderates. she's proressive all the way and a good democrat but probably not a good candidate."
6576,6592,1,yeah sure. good job repeating propaganda instead of thinking for yourself. 
6577,6593,1,has anyone thought about using a type of blockchain backed up with that crazy new quantum cryptography technology for securing passwords/keys? i mean obviously we need just as secure voting systems as gps/us military satellites. it's called cyberwarfare for a reason.sources: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610106/chinese-satellite-uses-quantum-cryptography-for-secure-video-conference-between-continents/https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/geneva-vote-will-use-quantum-cryptography
6578,6594,1,"definitely seems credible.  i'm not sure it's actually better than the alternative, however."
6579,6595,1,"just got back from a weekend campaigning for his opponent, andy kim. would be a huge victory in nj."
6580,6596,1,"of course. i can't say how many people on reddit and in real life i had to freaking correct who thought that the damage of a trump presidency would end when trump left office.now that we are living it and they're seeing firsthand the damage he's doing, suddenly they realize how important it was back then to vote for the ""lesser of two evils"" instead of petulantly throwing their vote away because clinton wasn't perfect."
6581,6597,1,there's no winning for her. :(
6582,6598,1,and it's unfortunate that it's just starting to be really talked about.
6583,6599,1,run michael bloomberg run!!
6584,6600,1,seeing trump and putin on tv together at those podiums is making my stomach hurt.
6585,6601,1,i dont get why people hate trump

6587,6603,1,"this was what, 5 days before the va gov election? ugh...that pissed me off. i like her message about banks, but overall, i don't think she's a good general election candidate. i'll take garcetti, booker, or harris over her any day."
6588,6604,1,nonsense.russia 2012 wasnt russia 2016.and he didnt order the investigation to stand down.there are other subs where you can post your lies and people may buy your fake news.gtfo!
6589,6605,1,"good grief, i'd forgotten all about that. i mean, that's barely a half-step away from ""let them eat cake""."
6590,6606,1,love her
6591,6607,1,"apparently biden and warren are polling very well in nh:http://www.newsweek.com/are-bernie-sanderss-2020-polling-numbers-slipping-survey-new-hampshire-voters-908766i must admit im not thrilled about either of the top 3, but we'll see."
6592,6608,1,"sure... what were you saying about ""shaming"" people in your post? do you even have anything of substance to say about actual issues? seems that you are just here to make petty comments and judgments about this sub and its posters. hypocrite much?"
6593,6609,1,it should
6594,6610,1,https://youtu.be/yfc3rxn0j1s
6595,6611,1,at least she didnt commit treason unlike that orange hitler you support
6596,6612,1,its a great way to stay in shape!
6597,6613,1,"im a white male.  (hopefully that first statement doesnt make your ears burn but i cant help it if it does.) in 2016 and early 2017 attended my county, my state and the national democratic convention.  i cant count how many times a hillary supporter implied or flat out called me racist or sexist without even knowing me at these events.  this mentality came from the national campaign and if it turned a liberal white male like myself off i can only imagine how it emboldened a fox news watching white male conservative.  white men will live in the us for the foreseeable future and make up a significant part of the electorate.  democratic campaigns have to learn how to reach out to them and at the very least not piss them off so they have motivation to vote for a republican."
6598,6614,1,"and if she chooses to abstain, just as she likely would (permission from the party for that one) pence can push it through. murkowski needs to promise not to vote for a judge like this too, tbh."
6599,6615,1,because she's a brilliant senator who spent years fighting for women/ lgtb and because she's a really strong advocate for gun control and so on.because she kicked ass with releasing the gps transcripts.because we value the representation of women in politics.unless she resigns there's no reason whatsoever to replace her with some dude.and fyi: just because i posted a link here doesnt mean this sub backs her.
6600,6616,1,i need to see some evidence that the people who fucked up actually feel some sort of remorse. they act like we're the ones who did something wrong when they're the ones who fell for obvious propaganda. i can't trust people who don't learn from their mistakes.
6601,6617,1,she knew. podesta's hackers were immediately tied to russia.
6602,6618,1,"she is their emmanuel goldstein :> the program of the two minutes hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which goldstein was not the principal figure. he was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the party's purity. all subsequent crimes against the party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching."
6603,6619,1,exelent point and having their own network (fox) helps in the rallying cry of anti hillary boogie man fanaticism.  
6604,6620,1,you think too highly of the public. 
6605,6621,1,there should be a subreddit dedicated to these kinds of blasts from the past comments that have aged terribly.
6606,6622,1,https://mobile.twitter.com/maddow/status/990281550678896641
6607,6623,1,not to mention what cruz and rubio did in the primaries is worthless now that they've become such suckups.
6608,6624,1,the real problem is that not enough hate him where they need to: the swing states. 
6609,6625,1,this comment section is like a tl;dr of this article lol
6610,6626,1,joseph goebbels would be proud of fox news.
6611,6627,1,"and he probably regretted not striking then even though he wanted to save others lives, didn't want to go against congress, and he probably was not sure about the intelligence of which he did not want to get out into the public, but he didn't just ignore him later like the gop. which is why he was obsessed with him and taliban enough to warn bush....but cheney did not have to worry about the public getting intelligence later, bc we all know what happened later. one of these days history will agree that the gop is horrible at governing a super power."
6612,6628,1,"i have to say, this is why i love this sub.the first two comments i see are stressing how this site, while perhaps having a point, neither has concrete evidence or the reputable reputation necessary to make such a claim.  which isn't to say it's impossible, but that this isn't yet enough to substantiate the idea of russia changing votes directly. because we're hillary voters and we need some evidence and facts first before we can make a real judgement. "
6613,6629,1,"for what it's worth, america includes this entire hemisphere. "
6614,6630,1,"hmm or when one candidate's campaign team steals data from his opponent, or has his message amplified by russia.there's only one candidate who rigged the primaries and his name is saint bernard the bullshitter"
6615,6631,1,"so manafort is guilty on 8 counts so far. cohen has pled guilty. then there's flynn, papdopolus... lock *her* up?"
6616,6632,1,"my friend and i were very close. i was hoping that she and i could be together, but found somebody else and ive been going through mixed emotions about it. "
6617,6633,1,"we have an endorsement?  i'm still in the let them battle-it-out-in-the-primaries mode.  sink or swim, show your true colors, let the best person win."
6618,6634,1,"holy shit!!! that was an intellectual powerhouse! awesome views on geopolitics, and what a fun argument to listen to.at 20 minutes i was sending links to every feminist in my contact list and at 37 minutes i was engaged in their civil debate and discussion. very awesome. thank you so much for posting this. "
6619,6635,1,"they've been sore winners for the past two years, does this surprise anyone?  they seem to get pleasure out of our pain and fear."
6620,6636,1,"and they will beat those women opponents because one major group that picks men over women, is women. please, for the love of god, prove me wrong women. i won't hold my breath though. "

6626,6642,1,"""blame men"" is not ""discussing the fact that women who reject a man sometimes end up murdered and that most murderers are men."" ""blame men"" is identity politics.should we ""blame black people"" because black people on average have a higher rate of murders than white people? no. there are a complex web of historical and socioeconomic reasons for this, such as slavery, such as jim crow, such as mass incarceration of black fathers via the war on drugs.well there's a complex web of phenomena behind this. men today did not invent the expectation that men should make the first move in dating, or male ""toughness"" & ""boys don't cry"", or the idea that a rejection is somehow an insult. those things are nasty inheritances that have arisen from the fact that our societies have developed in a patriarchal manner, and these expectations have proven difficult to shed.i don't have a concrete answer to any of these problems, but ""blame men"" is worse than doing nothing, it just creates resentment and retrenchment."

6680,6696,1,losing the house and the senate is the price they're willing to pay to get a 5-4 majority on the scotus.
6681,6697,1,"maybe you need to speak to the rest of the world. here in europe we see trump as a corrupt conman and a laughingstock, humiliating the us every day and in all respects. maybe you should take this message to your fellow republicans."
6682,6698,1,"kid? im probably old enough to be your grandma, asshole."
6683,6699,1,"no obama did an amazing job communicating to america what trayvon martin actually meant to the black community.  did some conservatives spin it for political points. of course! but he was already president and thats the key point.  he wouldnt have made the same speech on the campaign trail.  campaigns and governing are two completely different things.  you have to win campaigns to govern.  democrats screwed that one up in 2016 and the blame should start at the top.  two years later its still blame sexism, blame white people. whomp whomp.pick and choose your battles.  democrats cant have divisive presidential campaigns like hillary did and win.  republicans can unfortunately. her campaign was so divisive she couldnt even convince a majority of white women to vote for her... those women must hate women according to your logic and reasoning.  they were blinded by their white privilege.  someone didnt shame them enough to vote for hillary. "
6684,6700,1,a moron can not like trump at this point. a moron like dore and every single tyt bros. that doesn't mean that they are actually providing useful solutions or viewpoints which none of them are doing. bernie bros tactics are wearing thin.

6691,6707,1,i wonder how those fbi agents feel now that trump has pretty much declared the fbi an enemy of the people.
6692,6708,1,"the government could use that advice, too."
6693,6709,1,"there's a huge disinformation campaign against her, and the anger of the right wing is a very good sign of the fear that exists around the new wave of the party.i was talking to someone at work this week who takes the pseudo-intellectual ""i'm not a trump supporter, but i can see why the disenfranchised people in the u.s. supported him"" viewpoint. then, he proceeded to go on a tirade about ao-c. it drives me crazy that people can excuse trump followers as those who have been left behind but don't realize that her supporters are part of the same disenfranchised.two sides of the same coin, no matter how you feel about her."
6694,6710,1,"nonsense, father soros pays me every week."
6695,6711,1,">following clintons impassioned speech, adichie (clad in hot pink for the occasion) joined her on stage. together, they covered topics from clintons hesitation to display emotion publiclygrowing up in the 1950s, she said, was a time in which exhibiting any kind of emotion was the worst thing you could doto the problem of clintons likability (adichie: i kept thinking, who the hell cares? shes qualified!). the two discussed the last few years of clintons life, in and out of politics. clinton, in turn, gave her answers with more candor than were generally privy to; when asked, for example, about the untruths that the public has believed about her, she cited an ohio state study that detailed the significant influence of three stories on obama voters who either didnt vote in 2016 or voted for trump or a third party. the three were: that i was dying, she said, incredulously. the second was that the pope had endorsed trump. and the third was that i was supplying weapons to isis. now, why do people believe that? well, partly because those stories are delivered in a way that looks like news. "
6696,6712,1,call the republican ones too.  remind them of what they did when there was the scalia vacancy.

6702,6718,1,agreed. the moment she was made a mainstream political figure was the moment the tea partiers and like minded extremists got empowered and that's what we're seeing today.
6703,6719,1,"today will be a great day for progressives everywhere! we have a great diverse set of candidates, many of whom are honest and incorruptible. if you live in kansas, support brent welder!"
6704,6720,1,i really hate when people try to compare two womens experiences with sexual harassment and/or assault.
6705,6721,1,she beat him by almost 3 million votes already so of course it would be a landslide in a re-run.
6706,6722,1,i really hate when people try to compare two womens experiences with sexual harassment and/or assault.
6707,6723,1,one can dream baby. one can dream! but after his name recognition last year i find it that will be very difficult.
6708,6724,1,"if there's one thing this election taught us it's that there are a lot of pitifully gullible people out there.some very committed, very depraved people targeted him. one even pretended to befriend him. no doubt he had no clue what kind of people he was dealing with. they fooled him, but there are millions of clueless people out there just like him."

6714,6730,1,i cant help but notice that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.
6715,6731,1,"wouldnt gore then have similar if not better experience than hillary when he ran? 8 years in the house, 8 years in the senate and 8 years as vp. we dont really know exactly what hillary advised on as the first lady and technically it is only a ceremonial role. with that said, her only competition imo is h.w and gore from the last 30 years of any presidential candidate.

6716,6732,1,another blow to how trump is tryingand failingto get rich off his presidencyhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2018/10/02/how-trump-is-tryingand-failingto-get-rich-off-his-presidency/
6717,6733,1,"the problem is the poll is on trump himself, he might not be that popular but his policies are. even people who aren't fond of his demeanor will vote for 3.8% unemployment, lowest for minorities ever, 3% growth, the destruction of isis and the vast majority of americans want our border secured... like him or not, it's hard to vote against all that."
6718,6734,1,iran should start flattering donald trump.
6719,6735,1,love this show! keeps getting better.
6720,6736,1,"well that was an incredibly bigoted response. my family recently immigrated into the us from mexico, and i think ive been doing quite well and learning the intricacies of the language.  "
6721,6737,1,"this is probably true of many bernicrat, too."
6722,6738,1,"i know that is technically the baby boomer years but it is bullshit. with the range of years that wide, baby boomers could have had children that were also baby boomers. logic and reason bring you to the conclusion that you cannot be the same generation as your own child.  i don't accept the 1960's births as baby boomers. "
6723,6739,1,remember when trump said he hires the best people  he only hires criminals like himself
6724,6740,1,bad behavior = behavior that they're doing that i personally don't likerepublicans are hypocrites.
6725,6741,1,"i like both of those sayings, but i guess i haven't thought deeply about them either."
6726,6742,1,">perhaps the hardest truth for many people to accept in the entire comey saga is the possibility (likelihood) that donald trump and james comey are both terrible. that there might not be a hero in this particular story.>or that there was, and comey made not *a* but *the* deciding factor in the election that would otherwise have made her our president.yep"
6727,6743,1,continually debunking the same conspiracy theories has that effect on people.
6728,6744,1,i found out that i have some audible credits. does anyone have any books they'd recommend? 
6729,6745,1,lmao. trying to claim that republican led hearings against hillary were rigged is the best way to prove that you're either an idiot or a russian troll. well done.
6730,6746,1,"i never bought into the anti-hillary propaganda that portrayed her like the devil incarnate. she was robbed of the presidency, but outright cheating, but her time has come and gone. "
6731,6747,1,total trash. you know when giuliani is being brought back in the national conversation by trump that he's at a real low point. all he's got left is to turn back to the trolls like giuliani to do his bidding.
6732,6748,1,/r/is_she_locked_up_yet
6733,6749,1,"i do not agree with mccain on many issues, and i do not condone many of his actions in the past, such as his use of derogatory terms toward asians (though he supposedly apologized for this during his primaries so i guess i forgive him).but the reactions to his death from the far left and the far right are really screwed up. on one hand i see trump supporters with their ""burn in hell"" comments, and on the other i see people on my facebook feed (who supported jill stein election) talking about how it's okay to celebrate his death"
6734,6750,1,"she's so incredible. this wouldn't have happened if she was president, which she rightfully earned and deserved to be. "
6735,6751,1,definitely. but it should be noteworthy when conservatives like her are now also pointing it out.
6736,6752,1,"okay but no one is saying that. so what do you want exactly? it's like you're saying they shouldn't just be anti-trump and when we say ""they're not and mostly talk about other stuff"" it's now just ""well people aren't hearing them."" well, sorry. there's a narcissist with the office of the presidency and his own media empire. he's pretty good at getting attention. so yea people who don't pay enough attention only hear about trump. i just don't see how that has to do with democrats, their goals and their messages.hillary talked almost entirely about stuff other than trump but out of an hour long speech the media would grab the few lines opposing trump and play them endlessly. they do that because it gets ratings because people are infatuated with the narcissist. but unless you have a magic trick that fixes that problem i don't know what you want democrats to do about it.further, half this country thinks stand-up comedians are like the pr department of democrats so when they make jokes about trump they think all democrats talk about is trump. i hardly hear my senators mention trump's name unless they are taking specific actions to oppose a specific policy and they virtually always have an alternative. it's not their fault our media sucks. and there frankly isn't an obvious solution here. if there was people would be pursuing it."
6737,6753,1,"why do you think a progressive would have produced better and quicker results? bernie sanders, as an example, has achieved very little during his many decades in politics. vermont is last in gdp and when they tried to implement single payer it bankrupted the state."
6738,6754,1,"yes, they would rather die than admit it."
6739,6755,1,"its not his job to look at polls and decide he can intervene.he threw the election to trump and sat on the trump/ russia investigation.i get it: it's fun to see him fight with trump, but comey is utter trash."
6740,6756,1,look at these polls:https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/4/20/17261726/poll-prri-white-evangelical-support-for-trump-is-at-an-all-time-high
6741,6757,1,"""attack""? we're pissing ourselves laughing here.i mean, here's someone genuinely so thick he *almost* deliberately got himself stomped flat by the fbi in order to...own the libs?there's just nothing left to attack, he's taken care of every possible degree of humiliation himself. only sheer joy left for us. bless."
6742,6758,1,the few people i know who voted for trump are now saying a lot of discouraging things about him and are showing signs of regret. im quietly thinking to myself i told you so. the electoral college needs to be abolished!
6743,6759,1,"so she and obama knew how infiltrated the us had become, and 1 month before the election both of them claimed it was laughable that anyone would think the us presidential election could be rigged.if what you say is true, that action of hers sounds like she assumed the infiltrators were aiding her."
6744,6760,1,why the stickers on the van then?
6745,6761,1,"what with chump's travel ban, the janus case and now this, it has been a bad week so far, and it's only wednesday.for the record,  i  fully expect the chump scotus to outlaw abortion should that orange cheeto get a second term.  i just don't recognize my country anymore :("
6746,6762,1,stronger together? 
6747,6763,1,"that sucks - yeah, gawande's pretty good with that stuff though.  he actually wants to look at inefficiencies rather tan just making obvious cuts, and he's pretty understanding of the human aspect of being a health care provider."
6748,6764,1,i agree with her 100%.&#x200b;vote blue in november no matter what.   do your part to take back congress and maybe we can slow down the destruction of our country by deplorable thugs.

6755,6771,1,"no, its better to have people who realizes the idiocy of the gop from the start"
6756,6772,1,"oh i know how our politics works, there's no need to be condescending just because you've managed to diminish more than half the country. the fact is that people like you and the president don't care about the majority of the country because you think it's justified by the outdated electoral system and then you get offended when the majority of the country is against what the president's mandate is. so go ahead and say that he's president because he won where it actually mattered - people like you and the president don't care about the country... you only care about the people in places that ""actually mattered"". that's a sick way to look at it."

6773,6789,1,"> basically what i'm saying is that if democrats stop taking corporate money, real progressives will win primaries because they aren't facing up against fundraising (by the very wealthy) from the economically center right democrats and there will be more than just a few real progressive voices in congress. then i think we can finally work on getting money out of politics.every time i see this kind of argument about ""corporate money"" from ""progressives"" and bernie bros i wonder whether they/you realize the hypocrisy of these statements. you want corporate money out... that's all well and good. but what about your involvement in corporate money? you use smartphones, use amazon, buy gas etc... isn't that corporate money? that's your money. if you want corporate money out of politics then how do you justify contributing to corporations? what about corporations who help society with their money? money in politics is definitely poisonous in certain ways but it is necessary to get politicians elected. hence bernie's donations. if democrats stop taking ""corporate money"" as you say, should they stop taking money from individuals who work for corporations? this is a vague argument based on an vague ideology."

6791,6807,1,">i think it was just the media's way of trying to avoid talking about how trump gave so many people the courage to be horrible people.maybe, but the media probably had good reason to avoid talking about that hate. i read somewhere that the easiest way to stop spreading hate and violence is to just stop covering it. what they failed to do and still fail to do is ask ""why are they hating?"" this article by walsh answers that i think.the feeling these white men have seems similar to in-office competition. it is natural to feel competitive. it's primal, like if you have a certain pecking order in the office and someone who used to be beneath your position rightfully gets a promotion, dont you feel anxious? of course you do. investigative journalists dont get airtime, except for maybe rachel maddow. now, back to the office analogy, that anxiety is supposed to make you work harder. why work harder if you can just complain and hire russians to hack your boss's boss and your poor coworker?"
6792,6808,1,so is it *likely* trump will be impeached? or is it looking like he'll serve a full term? i'm really not sure myself. 
6793,6809,1,"dont change the fact that trump's campaign, transition team, and wh staff are corrupt af."
6794,6810,1,"i mean, i'm on board, but i don't exactly use any of those advertisers...&#x200b;i guess when you advertise on fox news you're going after a pretty specific demographic... older, more conservative... and the list of companies kinda reflects that."
6795,6811,1,if she kneecaps bernie than im all for it.
6796,6812,1,"if the results tonight are the same as 2016, this country deserves anything and everything it gets. i cannot imagine what more needs to be said and done to get people to vote. if they don't want to vote, then fuck them. let the gop fuck this country over, it's poetic justice at that point."
6797,6813,1,it can happen here. and it did. 
6798,6814,1,"there's excitement in places, usually for progressive candidates. otherwise, the message is ""vote in november to stop the republicans,"" and i don't see a plan for if this works, democrats gain control and out trump. then that leverage is gone and it leaves us where we've been for close to 20 years. i don't know how many people on here were around for the 2000 election, or 2004. those were dark times for liberals and i see us going back there. "
6799,6815,1,"check this guy out. he speaks a lot like obama imo. i really believe this guy could be it. this guy could save this country from trump, appeal to all bases, and unite the left and independents. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jx3m7jk1cy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jx3m7jk1cy)"
6800,6816,1,nobody is running for president right now besides trump. its anyones field in the democratic primary in im still with her
6801,6817,1,i love feinstein but i really wish she would just retire. california is a very liberal state that would have no problem choosing another democratic senator after her.

6805,6821,1,"honestly, i'm of the belief that nothing but losing their jobs, personally, or losing their children in a war that we aren't winning, is going to turn many trump-ites against him.  but, if they were more logically minded, and actually cared about the economy, this would make for a good political ad: https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-iran-deal-decision-will-hurt-american-businesses-and-american-workersalso, this is pretty far down the list of why i think leaving the iran deal is a bad idea, but, you know..."

6816,6832,1,why would that goal need to be updated?
6817,6833,1,"maybe this is a weird thing to focus on, but this article was so oddly framed.  it feels like the writer was talking to an american for the first time and noting all the differences in language, rather than interviewing someone with a lot of wonderful things to say.of course chelsea wouldn't say, for example, ""well done,"" because that's a british colloquialism, and chelsea is american.  i'm trying to think of an american equivalent, but we don't really have one, and i feel like that's because, ironically enough, that turn of phrase sounds incredibly condescending to my american ears. from what i gathered, the writer has a problem with chelsea's american syntax, word choice, and construction, and uses that to chastise her for being too aloof.  i think the point the writer was trying to make, if i'm being generous, was that chelsea is polished (and of course she is, as the writer pointed out, she's always been in the political spotlight), but then she (the writer) called her language clunky, which negates that point.  i think chelsea's extremely well-spoken, yes, just like her mother.  but, i'm sick of that being termed as cold, especially from foreign press who, in this case, doesn't seem to understand our speech patterns.  i loved what chelsea said, but hated the framing of it.  maybe the writer could have focused on her meaning, rather than the words used to convey it.  but i guess i should take my own advice and focus on chelsea instead, too. :)"
6818,6834,1,"they only knew because he had over the top, unrealistic things to say and drew in purists who didn't do their research but liked what he had to say.  people like you.  no way would moderates have voted for him, and if people did their research, they'd know there's no way any of those proposals would get through congress.  i think the only person in the world i hate more than i hate bernie is trump and there's nothing i'd love more than to see him lose his senate seat.  and i'm sorry, but the democratic nomination should go to a democrat.  bernie trying to get the democratic nomination would be like someone from harvard trying to run for a student government position at yale."

6820,6836,1,"wait, i don't post ""bernie crap"", i post things relevant to the democratic party. aoc, i believe, represents the future, with so many of the democratic leadership being old. and what in my comment was sexist...? complimenting her appearance? it was a lighthearted comment! otherwise, any man who compliments a women would be sexist. "
6821,6837,1,"ok? but it is indisputable that she had/has a waaaay better understanding of policy, government, and institutions than our current president. she had better education, experience, and background as well.but voters in '16 tossed all that out and went for the outsider. the least qualified candidate of a major party in the history of this country. and we all see where that led us. it was an experiment that has utterly failed."

6885,6901,1,nice joke.
6886,6902,1,the stormy daniels story is important because of the violent threats she received from djt via cohen that's been buried under the typical sensationalist nonsense.
6887,6903,1,"wtf, his actions are the definition of bias. you have two people running for president, both are under investigation, but you disclose one, and lie about the other. you can't have it both ways, either disclose both investigations, or keep your mouth shut till after the election. "
6888,6904,1,"well we'll see how she does. but no one will consider her a ""pioneer"" as big as hillary just because she's a woman. if she starts actually working for issues that break barriers like hillary did, then maybe. if she works for all issues not just economic then maybe. given her rhetoric, i'm not expecting that but it'll be a pleasant surprise. we'll see. there are plenty of other women who are more worthy of inheriting hillary's mantle than aoc is at the moment."
6889,6905,1,what's really sad is that you screenshotted this very comment so you can go get high fives back at t_d.

6892,6908,1,forget all the other books. the fact that it's woodward is enough. and he's made it a point not to rely on his reputation - he's provided receipts. this is damning. 
6893,6909,1,"lmao who cares about sully, he's just some pilot. maybe a good one, but any pilot ever would try to land their plane when it crashed. and the fact that he was a life long republican just makes it clear that he has spent most of his live voting to fuck over poor people, probably not a great guy. not sure why anyone pays any attention to the man."

6895,6911,1,he should put his ass out in waukesha county and let them foot the bill for his security. they're the ones that voted for him. seriously the worst possible night to have to attend to a presidential security detail because the opening night of summerfest is also the night of the big bang fireworks so downtown is packed and people are spread out all over looking for spots to watch.
6896,6912,1,why should we care? they'd vote for a dead guy before a democrat.
6897,6913,1,hillary isn't fighting anyone. she's too busy being an amazing human being.
6898,6914,1,"it felt like hillary's primary offense was being a democrat more than anything else.  democrats seem to be held to much higher standards.  while gore and kerry weren't treated quite as horribly, they were both far more qualified than w and were attacked respectively for being ""boring"" and for ""flip-flopping."""

6901,6917,1,"in nebraska news, republican state senator bob krist has won the democratic nomination for governor, jane raybould has won the senate primary, and kara eastman has provisionally beaten brad ashford for the ne-02 spot, overtaking him by 163 votes. "
6902,6918,1,i thought it was being a woman who didn't like to stay at home and make cookies.
6903,6919,1,how do you mean? hes worked across the aisle? shouldnt that be a positive?
6904,6920,1,i keep wondering why we are not hearing the press remind people that trump also met with putin in 2017 with only putin's interpreter present during the g-20 summit. this cannot be allowed to continue. we have the right to know what trump is saying when he is representing the united states. 
6905,6921,1,"there are still the dead-enders that were influenced by them, and a few leftover bots running."
6906,6922,1,i cannot agree more with this article. 
6907,6923,1,id say its on par with dailykos or medium.
6908,6924,1,i do all those things. we're campaigning hard for mikie sherrill in my district now that frelinghuysen is retiring but it's so hard not to feel depressed and angry seeing all the crap going on. 
6909,6925,1,"hey, anybody remember when donald trump said his administration would be better for lgbt americans than hillary? [i do.](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/7/26/16034404/trump-lgbtq-rights)"
6910,6926,1,"not the campaign, he asked russia for the deleted emails from her tenure at state. and we all knew they probably had it. if you're sec. of state and you bring your unsecured blackberry to russia or china, it'd basically be malpractice for them *not* to hack you."
6911,6927,1,true. 
6912,6928,1,"if hillary should run again, let me advise her to confront this issue head on. hold some forums in west texas of west virginia with people who think youre the devil. have the conversation!!  she doesnt need to convince everyone but surely needs to win over a few points in pa, wi, fl, & oh. its ironic that obama radicalized many of these voters which is why they wouldnt give her a chance this time, unlike in 2008. "
6913,6929,1,"which absolute claims? i have in fact made no claims whatsoever about nys politics, except pointing out nixon is inexperienced.you're losing the debate and decide to throw around insults instead.anyway: take your lame bro behavior elsewhere."

6921,6937,1,this video requires payment to watch.wtaf?
6922,6938,1,"i think ocasio-cortez made the decision to have such a public presence after her win, and that had positives and negatives. it allowed her to connect nationwide with progressives, but it also magnified and sped up the sexism and criticism she would receive. the closest male equivalent to her level of success and notoriety is obama after he gave that democratic convention keynote address in 2004. but i think he was older and a bit more prepared for the attention.i have maintained that she gets to decide what type if representative she really wants to be when she gets into office. we will see what happens."
6923,6939,1,it's ridiculous how james gunn was fired. all because of a right-wing smear job.
6924,6940,1,merrick garland should be on the bench. that he didnt even get a confirmation hearing was an abuse of power by mcconnell. and theres nothing i or anyone else can do about it. its so fucking unfair and wrong. 
6925,6941,1,this is why we need to abolish the electoral college. let the people have a true 1 person 1 vote outcome. of course if (and i think it's possible) the russians hacked the vote then we still need to be very concerned. 
6926,6942,1,this article has been up for two weeks and the only comments are making fun of hillary.

6938,6954,1,"the most bitter irony of this election is that most of us, democrats and progressives, were screaming these warnings from the rooftops for years.  sometimes it feels like we mapped the minefield, and republican voters burned it.  "
6939,6955,1,"doesnt this just prove that hillary lost because she was a poor candidate, not because she's a woman?"
6940,6956,1,"it feels like the united states as we have known it is gone. we have a ruling class who has always manipulated our form of government by mobilizing bigots and racists through fear and hatred, but now it seems to have gone beyond the tipping point. the deck is stacked from the courts to the congress. seriously, screw everyone who did not vote for hillary clinton in 2016.

6946,6962,1,i love that she's taking on this kind of project - shining a light on the history of women's struggle for equal rights and also civil liberties as a whole. in a way i see it as a kind of response to a generational issue about women's rights and civil liberties that came up during the primaries but was largely ignored after - the importance of recognizing struggles of the activists who have allowed us to have so many of our modern civil liberties. i feel it's a perspective that many younger liberals/progressives need to remember/be educated about.
6947,6963,1,...most americans do not want gun safe inspections....where are you getting this from..?
6948,6964,1,"it isn't obsession it is winning. whether we like it or not, conservatives have made hillary the boogie-man. they have been winning by running against her for 20 years. every single republican candidate runs against hillary. in every ad and speech.  you know what, it works! they have been winning for 20 years. the only time they really lost was because of the financial crisis. other than that, they win by keep drumming up the boogie-man (hillary). as long as they keep dragging her out, they will keep winning. everyone is excited for 2018, sorry, they will keep both houses because they will keep running against hillary. if she would get out of the public eye maybe *maybe* the left could win. i am not saying it is fair, i am saying it is reality. i voted for hillary every chance i had. facts are facts. they win because they successfully branded her the villain. they won't lose until the left moves on from their current leadership (all in their 70s) and bring in new leaders. at least the right will have to work and branding new villains. again, donald trump is the president. donald trump, a reality star buffoon. that is how successful the right was at branding hillary the boogie-man. donald trump wouldn't have beaten any other candidate.edit: i am fine with the downvotes folks, the truth hurts when you don't want it to be true. however, have the character to come back and apologize to me when the republicans hold both houses after novembers election. if, somehow they don't, i will come back to r/hillary and happily say i was wrong. "
6949,6965,1,can we stop bringing race into everything? 
6950,6966,1,all kinds of people hurt me. that doesn't really have anything to do with the conceit of amateurs vs. professionals though. i sure as hell did not mean to rattle your cage.
6951,6967,1,"a white mans life is different depending on the city, state and region you live in and economics plays a huge role.  if you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.  i didnt say white men are oppressed and i wont say their privileged either, they live a human life.  the homeless in this country are predominantly male, next time you see one tell him hes privileged and thats why you wont give him any money.even trump who has lived a life of privilege seems to have a pretty miserable life and even before the presidency.  if white men were really living this privileged life that you keep talking about it would seem that they could find a little bit more happiness.a year ago i moved from oklahoma to los angeles.  the two cultures are so vastly different.  the democratic party is a coastal party that ignores the issues of the middle of the country thats why we are where we are at.  in oklahoma where i was apart of the democratic party, the hillary supporters had no problem labeling men in oklahoma as sexist and say thats why they wouldnt vote for clinton but at the very same time we had a female republican governor running the state.  texas, kansas, louisiana, arizona and many other red states have had female governors while states like new york and california have not.its not about privilege, race or gender its about bringing people together, speaking to their issues and not dividing them, especially by race and gender.  sad to say but democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican (trump  is not average).  obama brought people together clinton divided.  we all lost when her campaign started dividing people and it started long before trump got the republican nomination."
6952,6968,1,"wait, i thought they had so much influence that they are to blame for president trump?"
6953,6969,1,this should be the end for him.
6954,6970,1,what are you talking about? she was in therapy because of this assault. you never forget!!! i'd come out if someone who attracted me was to become such an influential person for life!

6959,6975,1,that the obama administration had been able to keep russia at bay and handicapped with sanctions. it wasn't until a presidential candidate and an entire political party decided to work with russia that they began to have influence again. 
6960,6976,1," i saw a video from a young turks reporter who interviewed trump supporters at a arizona rally. those people are gone. they didn't believe a poll that said trump only had 3 percent support in the black community. they said it was more like 35 percent. the young turks reporter said they are so fanatical, they could relect him inspite of his scandals and pathological lying. that scares me!"

7071,7087,1,"from hillary's speech just now in ny, about cuomo:we need leaders who believe in producing results and getting things done  leaders like andrew cuomo and kathy hochul, she said.since gov. cuomo took office, new york has passed marriage equality, implemented common-sense gun safety laws, and adopted the strongest paid-family leave policy in america, clinton said, rehashing achievements that previous speakers had praised. he is not afraid to take on anyone who tries to hurt this state or our country.clinton also mentioned the accomplishments where she had personally supported cuomo. after the heartbreak of the 2016 election, i was overjoyed when gov. cuomo announced plans to put an affordable college education available for everyone, said clinton, referring to the excelsior scholarship. i was proud to stand with him when new york became the first state to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.cuomo won the party's nomination with 95% of the vote.i for one am happy hillary emphasized cuomo's progressive accomplishments, especially since nixon is trying to make him look like some evil republican."

7158,7174,1,"i hope you are correct.  i'm nervous however.  i just watched thom hartmann.  bernie introduced a bill this morning to pay for safe elections and the republicans (like paul) who say it is partisan.  meanwhile, there are right-wing radio crazies saying it's time for violence to stop the dems from taking out a duly elected president.  these are scary times."
7159,7175,1,"rudi giuliani just said on tv that trump reimbursed cohen for the stormy daniels payment and legal twitter thinks he provided the ammo to take trump down.if a hooker and giuliani together take trump down, i'm never ever gonna stop laughing.https://mobile.twitter.com/philippereines/status/991858144572829696"

7162,7178,1,"what's your definition of a ""true progressive?"""
7163,7179,1,what would be the process? trump fires sessions and appoints someone whos new and not recused who fires mueller? or can trump directly fire mueller or rosenstein? it seems to me that sessions hasnt been fired because he must know something. 
7164,7180,1,no one would ever do that. ever.
7165,7181,1,"she definitely wont. shes a lot of things, but she is not stupid. "
7166,7182,1,why are you linking a paper owned by the kushner family?

7168,7184,1,"newscasters talk a lot about what james comey says in his book about trump, but not enough about the early chapters where he talks about his work as a prosecutor working against the mafia. i know people are gonna be buying/looking in for the trump stuff, but those first couple of chapters about his work and mafia culture are pretty interesting."
7169,7185,1,"i did, yes."
7170,7186,1,"symbols are funny things. they show up, even when we don't mean for them to. your characterization of clinton as a *serpent* shows latent, or maybe blatent, sexism. few would describe any man as a *serpent*. maybe a snake, maybe *cold blooded*, but not *serpent*. your user of the symbol is linked, directly or indirectly, to the biblical fall from grace narrative, which is a deeply symbolic tale that shows the subliminal - and often times obvious z mistrust of women as sexual temptress, easily duped, curious to a fault, or otherwise inherently broken. "
7171,7187,1,"beautiful advice: be brave, despite not being perfect. be resilient. be kind. be grateful. she delivered it brilliantly in a way that really spoke to me. everyone should watch this video. "

7175,7191,1,"it's so nice to hear actual criticism of him. i'm just gonna keep it short and respond to your points one by one because you bring up some great points. i think it's just human nature that if you take a lot of money from someone than you're biased for them. i don't dislike the idea of an establishment, i just don't like the establishment we have today (cause yea of course, just like how i want a surgeon to do my heart surgery, i want my politicians to run the government). which of bernie ideas are are unrealistic that other modern nations haven't already successfully implemented? do you mean you don't think we can get his policies with the us's fucked up political scale, because there would be negotiations and compromises. who is he hateful towards? he just doesn't have patience for those who don't have a vision for the future and want to keep things status quo. he has a long history of fighting for equality. bernie has been incredibly consistent for his entire political career. yea, i wouldnt like it either if the person i disagreed with was in power idk about you. i looked up that quote and couldn't find anything. i think he might have noted how he did win on a a campaign that had the message of being anti establishment, but then doing the same old establishment stuff. i also looked up ""bernie sanders jeff sessions"" and found nothing but bernie bashing jeff sessions "

7178,7194,1,watching this senate judiciary committee drone on and on with their predictable partisan lies only one thought comes to mind: the republicans have broken our country.
7179,7195,1,"there was a time during the bush administration where glenn worked in a good faith way discussing facts and being logical in how the bush admin wasn't.  he was one of the first journalists that i remember reading regularly that saw through the rah rah nationalism goong on from 2001 until around 2007.he started getting bad in late 2007/early 2008 when it was pretty clear the nation was going to choose a democrat in the next election.  he started just criticisizing democrats even thougj bush was still in office.  he kept this up all through the obama administration.  just criticisizing all the time with no acknowledgement of any of the good that obama did.i remember an argument he had with neera tanden on twitter during the election in 2016.  neera said something that was minorly wrong but her overall point (something about trump) was right.  however, glenn would not back down from hammering on the one minor wrong point.  he sounded like a trump apologist.he's a jackass.  he ended up having the same arc as asanage.  fuck them both."

7183,7199,1,anyone who has ties to assad no matter what party should be called out... includes kucinich and tulsi etc. we need to be exposing what assad has been doing to his own people. we may not want american involvement but we can't be blind to what putin and assad have been doing in syria
7184,7200,1,"it is distressing to see the only thing that unites certain supporters of certain ""leaders"" is their racism and their ignorance. plus the real battle is against the propaganda that is coming from the corporate community and the russians. "

7194,7210,1,bernie is still held to a higher standard than republicans. i think most people were aware that bernie's plans were mostly aspirational.
7195,7211,1,"no, actually you came here and started lying like a 50 cent rug.then when you got exposed as ignorant you went on and now finally you are trying to turn it around. she got more votes. it had nothing to do with a vagina.maybe you need some vagina and you wouldnt be so triggered over her. she also had a detailed policy plan. more than anyone else who has ever ran for president. i am not a huge fan of hers, but it makes me sick to still see you phony self-entitled garbage eaters still hating on hers.we will remember, and the phonies will have no seat at the table.

7211,7227,1,people on the right want no government? really? if that's the case then why are the right intent on government controlling a woman's right to choose? why are the right intent on tax cuts just for a certain income bracket?i despise this man but what he's saying here is the truth - the extreme left had more in common with the right than actual liberals.

7274,7290,1,"it isn't sexism. at least, not just sexism. the only ""us and them"" that matters is capital, and labor. republicans, and democrats. after labor saw that it was going to be trump v. clinton, that was the time to rally behind clinton with all we had. that's what we did in 2008, and that's what's been done in every election prior to that that's ever been won: one holds one's nose, and picks the lesser of two evils. splitting the ticket only works for the other team, never one's own.it was a rookie mistake. it cost us the game. the damage will be severe, and long-lived.p.s.: almost forgot another basis of the ""us and them"": conservatives, mostly male, mostly white (and their financial dependents). and all of the rest of us (and our financial dependents. and there are many more depending on us to get it right than on theirs, because...capital, labor...i really thought you guys were too smart to be poached...)"

7290,7306,1,"> maybe, but the media probably had good reason to avoid talking about that hate.i don't believe the media avoided it out of some moral responsibility... they simply refused to acknowledge the empowering of bigotry. and it's just not with trump - they've been doing it since obama was elected with the rise of the tea party. i would buy the argument that the media willfully didn't cover the hate to stop spreading hate and violence but since trump has been in office we've seen journalists from the nyt write editorials after editorials about trump supporters.we're seeing more analyses and articles like this now but it's a little too late imo... kinda after the fact.

7373,7389,1,"honestly, she can easily win if she runs again.she just need better data analysts than last time, and change her decisions little bit and don't just letting everyone talk shit about her, but rather respond and kill lies in the root.i don't know, it seems like anyone can win an election, if this orange child won, than god forbid,even kayne can win it too."
7374,7390,1,i used to love her as an actressi literally cant stand to see her anymore.
7375,7391,1,only the democrats would care more about genetalia and melatonin than ideas and practicality 
7376,7392,1,bernie was just as populist as trump.
7377,7393,1,"this is entirely the opposite of what we would have seen under her administration. in this country children have no voice because they are not wealth makers or voters. under her government, children would have not have been invisible. what are they now but a weak and contemptible constituency that is accorded no respect."
7378,7394,1,"they had nothing. if they had legit basis then they would have would have used it during the elections which they tried to do wit the benghazi hearings. that's the best they had.  if they didn't succeed with those hearings in front of a gop congress and senate then they certainly wouldn't have success if she were in office even with a gop house and senate. it was just posturing to deter the lazy independents and skeptical moderate republicans.and then think about this, would mcconnel and the gop with a majority in the house and the senate really waste time trying to impeach hillary when all it would result in would be tim kaine become president? that means they would effectively waste 2 years of house and senate majority achieving nothing."

7380,7396,1,"look, i'm against *all* old farts in congress, regardless of gender (looking at you, orrin hatch). i am of the opinion that feinstein and pelosi need to go. they had a chance, when they controlled congress during the obama administration, to do real things, and they failed to. they're not effective leaders anymore, and i simply think they're too rich and too old to be able to relate to most of us. hell, look at feinstein's view on the whole presidio terrace debacle.p.s. i'm a woman and a feminist and a liberal and a lesbian. i'm not a misogynist ageist. "
7381,7397,1,"cool... so pointing out the age of a reddit account - that's all you've got? a one day old account could have pointed out your transparent bullshit. that's not going to hide your misogyny. ""better deal democrats""? wtf is that? democrats are the same. if you need to feed your sexist delusion, then stick to the bernie sub."
7382,7398,1,"you're playing tug of war. the other team is winning. you are cursing at the folks standing in front of you for not pulling hard enough and you've given up pulling with them out of spite.bill clinton was a centrist, hillary was always well to the left of him. "
7383,7399,1,how is trolling today?

7385,7401,1,https://twitter.com/markharrisnyc/status/1060933556883591169this is why bernie has lost any chance of being a legitimate leadership voice for dems and frankly for progressives as well. 
7386,7402,1,"i love how conservatives complain about ""left-wing mobs"", even though their side disproportionately conducts more terrorism. too bad no politician has the courage to call out right-wing terrorism. "
7387,7403,1,are you missing the point that right now being a good leader and standing up for democrat policies is hand in hand with opposing trump? so you want democrats to talk about their policies while pretending that trump isn't destroying the country? this is the same bullshit that got trump elected. you don't like the message so you pretend there's none and let people like trump get away with their shit. fuck this shit. 
7388,7404,1,"well, they're already spreading sex cult garbage about kirsten gillibrand, so just give them a little more time to get up and running."
7389,7405,1,or is that what we are supposed to think?
7390,7406,1,"tbh ""crash"" is a pretty dramatic way to describe hitting a concrete pillar inside a parking garage. "
7391,7407,1,"i realized today... there are *so many* subreddits dedicated to hating on trump and the republicans, but the ones dedicated to the party who is working to fight trump and the republicans and promote the progressive policies that people want - the democrats subreddit - only sees a fraction of the traffic that the other subreddits do. why are people so afraid to latch onto the party that is working to help and fight? they only want to complain, not work to implement solutions. "
7392,7408,1,"well, whoevers here still, im back at it. volunteering for katie hill on the weekends now. im back in the game "
7393,7409,1,>  bernie people fell for every bullshit piecei read a lot of the election shit and i *never* heard about that piece. 
7394,7410,1,the difference between medvedevs russia and putons russia is constantly understated on reddit. medvedev was far more western friendly and worked on nuclear disarmament treaties. the same ones putin is trying to get rid of. putin maintained some degree of power during that time but analysis shows that medvedev had a different approach than putin which he was capable of implementing.

7399,7415,1,did you cringe when bernie said repeatedly he wanted to cooperate with trump after the 2016 elections?did you cringe when he has his head so far up trump's voters a$$es he keeps saying they're not racist?
7400,7416,1,what a shame.
7401,7417,1,absolutely. i went to high school and college in the '80s and the picture that has been painted seems quite accurate.
7402,7418,1,"i'd like to see the democratic party rally behind politicians who don't accept pac money and corporate income. that's the simple reason why i want her to not run again. that said, if she runs again and is again the best candidate, then i will vote for her again. i get the frustration, since progressives want the current politicians to shift further left, but i agree that no one should tell her not to run.

7405,7421,1,"good for you then. you've reinforced your own assessment by trolling. that really proves something... to you. well done. the only thing i see is a donald troll trying desperately to say something outside their bubble. or, sorry, a bernie bro... i can't make out the difference anymore these days."
7406,7422,1,"in this discussion, you'd probably be right. though the headline is a little simplistic and crass, the author makes clear what they're talking about.i was genuinely reacting to the idea that the term ""identity politics"" is itself forbidden anymore. seriously if not that i'd like some term to describe the phenomena of radicalizing around relatively superficial group-based identities in the manner of a zero-sum game -- and often the cynical manipulation of those identities for ideological or other political purposes -- over grounding our mission for liberation from bigotry in a recognition of our profound common humanity. and i don't think ""tribal politics"" would be taken any better."

7411,7427,1,"not really - i root for the us first, then places i've lived in (spain, nigeria,) then after that it's kinda random.  i like messi, so i wanted him to do well. i usually keep politics out of sports, but i kind of didn't want to give putin the satisfaction, so i didn't want russia to win.  for a while, i was rooting for japan, just because no one outside of latin america or europe has ever won.  but, that didn't last long."

7416,7432,1,the bernie cult is pretty much a left wing version of the trump cult minus the bigotry.
7417,7433,1,there was no reason for her to apologize. everyone is being too pc these days
7418,7434,1,"we could use some ""power play"" tactics. we're not in power or even close to being able to see power through a telescope. (even clinton, had she edged this monster trump only with a slightly different distribution of voters / better roll of the dice, would still be obstructed by this same gop congress and gop state houses, only possibly facing a red wave during midterms right now.) one reason for that is a lot of people have grown disgusted with the limitations of the status quo. one party found a way to validate that, the other wasn't in that position. some closer to the ideological middle and relatively affluent haven't grown so disgusted, but they can't just stick their heads in the sand and pretend others have been content with the way things were drifting. the chant goes *""we are unstoppable, another world is possible,""* and we oughtn't be contradicting them on the latter point.you are correct, populist extremism is dangerous. elite out-of-touch complacency is also dangerous. everything in moderation, including moderation."
7419,7435,1,"sexism plays a major role in american politics. but, i think that a large part of the reason shes also being held to a higher standard is she was thrust into the spotlight when she defeated a big name in the democratic caucus. almost everyone in the spotlight is going to be disliked by a lot of people.look at obama, or schumer, or even paul ryan or mcturtlesenator. everyone hates all of those guys. "
7420,7436,1,nice try.
7421,7437,1,"based on your comment history...  i believe it's you that hasn't the slightest clue what you're talking about.  why do i say that?  because the above response you have is used over and over by you with zero substance behind your statement each time.i know forming a thought beyond, ""trump supporters are nazi racist morons"", is tough for you.  but, maybe one day you'll realize that in order to have an actual discussion with adults you'll have to come up with multiple thoughts and put sentences together to backup your opinions."

7434,7450,1,"> which votes prove it? oh i don't know.. how about the recent election?the recent election, as in the presidential one? as in the election where the democrats went out of their way to accommodate bernie's ""policies"" in to their platform and lost? if anything that move probably hurt the democrats.  > again, the party has lost it's way. and equal rights alone doesn't absolve a parties overwhelming transgressions... and here is the twisting of the narrative where y'all imply it's ""only"" about equal rights and use identity politics as a negative. and what are these transgressions? that's a pretty vague statement especially when you're saying that civil rights are secondary to the functionality of a political party. that's something.> and that's not just my opinion, but it's the opinion of many many many voters. no one is disputing that's your opinion. but it's not the opinion of the majority of democrats. if that was the case and the majority of dems felt  the party had lost its way then bernie would have won the primaries or at the least it would have been a close race but neither happened.>a lot of long time democratic voters switched and either voted for trump or a third party candidate and that should speak volumes to you.well this is yet another misrepresentation from you. come on, if you're trying to make a point, be honest instead of making up things and trying to pass them off as facts just because you want to believe it.>you have to learn to stop taking democratic criticisms against the party as personal attacks and look towards how you can make the party better and inclusive to everyone.. where exactly did i take anything as a ""personal attack""? this is exactly why bernie bros are so hated - as soon as someone calls out all the lies and misrepresentations y'all throw out, you hit back with condescension like this. it's a pretty low form of discourse.it's pretty rich to lecture me and other democrats about making the party more inclusive when people like you are actively dismissing equal rights as a secondary issue. yeah, let's be ""inclusive"" by focusing on one demographic. tell me how you're being ""inclusive"" by dismissing equal rights and all the economic and humanitarian repercussions?of course i'm going to post another rant. do you really expect to lie and misrepresent and get away with it? i don't care to change your opinion at all. you're welcome to it. but don't try and pass off your opinion as facts especially when you're dismissing other people.

7470,7486,1,"if this is paywalled for you, here is the whole article:**roger stone sought information on clinton from assange, emails show***ex-trump adviser urged intermediary to ask wikileaks for specific dates of rival candidates communications*by shelby holliday and  rob barryformer trump campaign adviser roger stone privately sought information he considered damaging to hillary clinton from wikileaks founder julian assange during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to emails reviewed by the wall street journal.the emails could raise new questions about mr. stones testimony before the house intelligence committee in september, in which he said he merely wanted confirmation from an acquaintance that mr. assange had information about mrs. clinton, according to a portion of the transcript that was made public.in a sept. 18, 2016, message, mr. stone urged an acquaintance who knew mr. assange to ask the wikileaks founder for emails related to mrs. clintons alleged role in disrupting a purported libyan peace deal in 2011 when she was secretary of state, referring to her by her initials.please ask assange for any state or hrc e-mail from august 10 to august 30--particularly on august 20, 2011, mr. stone wrote to randy credico, a new york radio personality who had interviewed mr. assange several weeks earlier. mr. stone, a longtime confidant of donald trump, had no formal role in his campaign at the time.in another email, mr. credico then asked mr. stone to give him a little bit of time, saying he thought mr. assange might appear on his radio show the next day. a few hours later, mr. credico wrote: that batch probably coming out in the next drop...i cant ask them favors every other day .i asked one of his lawyers...they have major legal headaches riggt now..relax.mr. credico said in an interview with the journal that he never passed the message on to mr. assange or his lawyers, but got tired of mr. stone bothering him, and so told mr. stone he had passed along the message. mr. credico said he did so because he owed mr. stone a favor for helping him book libertarian presidential candidate gary johnson as a guest on his show.mr. stone, in a text message to the journal, said that mr. credico had provided nothing to him and that wikileaks never handed anything over. both men deny ever having special access to wikileaks material.i never had possession or access to any clinton emails or records, mr. stone said, adding that his testimony before the house committee was complete and accurate.adam schiff (d., calif.), the ranking member of the house intelligence committee, said the emails hadnt been provided to congressional investigators. if there is such a document, then it would mean that his testimony was either deliberately incomplete or deliberately false, said mr. schiff, who has continued to request documents and conduct interviews with witnesses despite the committees probe concluding earlier this year said.a lawyer for mr. stone, grant smith, said the emails hadnt been turned over to house investigators because they were not encompassed within the scope of the committees request. mr. stone said the emails were preserved at the request of the senate, which is also conducting a russian interference probe. mr. smith said they hadnt yet been given to investigators there.the newly unearthed emails come amid signs that special counsel robert muellers team is examining mr. stones role in mr. trumps 2016 presidential campaign. among other matters, prosecutors have asked about mr. stones claim to have met with wikileaks during the campaign, according to a witness familiar with the investigation.u.s. officials have said wikileaks received material from operatives working on behalf of russias military intelligence group, which mr. assange has denied. the kremlin has denied it meddled in the election.messrs. stone and credico said they havent been contacted by mr. muellers office, which declined to comment. wikileaks didnt respond to requests for comment.in the initial email, which included an attachment with photos of libyan dictator moammar gadhafi and other documents, mr. stone sought to confirm speculation that mrs. clinton had unnecessarily supported the decision to continue bombing libya during the height of the countrys civil war in 2011. the conflict ultimately led to ghadafis killing at the hands of opposition forces. a spokesman for mrs. clinton didnt respond to requests for comment.several weeks after mr. stones email request, on oct. 3, 2016, an article ran on infowars.com, a conservative news outlet to which he frequently contributed during the campaign. the article included some of the same images as mr. stones initial email to mr. credico, and didnt include any unreleased clinton-related emails or wikileaks material.the emails appear to be consistent with mr. stones description in his sworn testimony of mr. credico as a go-between and an intermediary to wikileaks during the 2016 campaign, according to a portion of his interview that was made public.mr. credico, who considers himself a supporter of wikileaks, has publicly raised questions about the details of mr. stones claims and in recent weeks has called some of them false.mr. credico said his relationship with mr. assange and his team didnt begin until late august 2016, when the wikileaks founder agreed to do his radio show. by that time, mr. stone had already claimed to be in touch with mr. assange and appeared to predict the release of information damaging to mrs. clinton. mr. stone now says he assumed mr. credico was in touch with mr. assange during that time.after earlier asserting his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination in the house probe, mr. credico now says he is willing to talk with investigators. he said he met on wednesday with the committees democratic staff members for what he called a limited conversation about wikileaks, the 2016 campaign and mr. stone.as mr. credico has become more vocal about what he says are discrepancies in mr. stones account, mr. stone has responded with a series of threats, according to emails and text messages reviewed by the journal.in early april, in one of those emails, mr. stone accused mr. credico of serving as an informant.everyone says u are wearing a wire for mueller, the april 7 email said. two days later, mr. stone wrote: run your mouth = get sued. mr. credico denies being an informant.mr. stone said he was warning mr. credico against defaming him and urging him to simply tell the truth."

7582,7598,1,"> but the blatant whitewashing of one of the worst dictators ever alive is stunning.totally. this is one of the most worrying things about how the general public is viewing syria - a complete disregard for the genocide that has been ongoing for the last 5 years.  people are acting as if the air strikes last week was the beginning of a war... except the war there has been ongoing for 5 years.you can't be ""progressive"" and condone what assad has been doing. supporting ""non-intervention"" is not a good enough excuse to support politicians who are being paid by putin and assad.gabbard is one of the worst.  she is proof of the horseshoe theory.  her entire persona is built around being anti-obama and pro-assad. but isn't it funny how she hasn't said about trump.>i know someone who fled from syria in the 90s, he described the assad sr regime: from the hama massacre on, this regime has murdered everyone it could.assad is vicious. like you i know people from there and people who have lived there - it's devastating to hear them talk about how a civilized country has been destroyed by one man and his regime."

7586,7602,1,"yeah we're completely on different planets and that's probably because you have a specific, misconstrued opinion of clinton:>it's a pretty powerful trend that the party opposite that of the president gains in midtermsyes the trend is that the opposite party gains the midterms but trends are not concrete. and that's my point - hillary knew even when she was running how important it was for down candidates to succeed. you might not agree based on your opinion of her, but she would have made it a priority to get dems back in power which is what obama failed at when he became president. she is just more politically astute.>and clinton's skills (even her most ardent supporters usually admit) weren't those suited to the bully pulpit and rallying public pressure. and this is completely false. you won't see any ardent supporters admit to this because it's completely false. there's a difference to being suited to the bullying pulpit vs getting attention from the media. i don't think you should misrepresent her skills by tying in her supporters. her supporters know better than anyone else what she can do. do you think a woman like her would have elected senator twice, run for the nomination in2008 when she lost by a 1% (she probably won the popular vote) and then run again and win handily if she didn't have the skills suited for the ""bully pulpit""? >let's face it, we'd be mid-impeachment trials right now.and this is where you betray yourself - what exactly what she be impeached about? this is the argument people used to dissuade independents not to vote for her but there's no basis. there's literally nothing that she could be impeached for.  this is the argument the far left uses as a justification for her not being in office which is ridiculous.>but despite her triangulation she'd be getting obstructed by the whole right as a communist, and from a much more unchastened left as a neoliberal. not a recipe for productive success.and again... you assume there would be this partisan politics at play. she might have got obstructed from the right but she could have also prevented all the destructive things trump and the right have enabled - tax cuts... obamacare under threat... chip... daca... muslim ban... the paris agreement. all of those things would have been prevented if she was president even with a gop congress and senate. and the only people on the left who would call her a neoliberal as a negative label (because these people only care about labels) are not in the government.either ways, liberal values and policies would be far more protected than they are now even if populist candidates like aoc win. cause they can win but how do they exactly hope to achieve their socialist rhetoric under a republican president whether it be trump or pence. they have no plan to achieve their ideologies. what's the point then?

7599,7615,1,"we saw the way hillary was treated, is anyone surprised?"
7600,7616,1,"i would never argue she made no mistakes.in fact, i can list a few more.:pnow the question is: can you admit bernie made a huge mistake too?the key moment in 2016 was imo the morning after bernie lost the ca primary.you may remember that rather dramatic moment. the whole press and every politically interested man/ woman was waiting for him to admit defeat, endorse hillary and go to work.not with a huge chip on his shoulder but enthusiastically.he didnt.instead he spoke about how he'd still win, and launched a huge attack on both hillary and the dnc.he continued that for 5 full weeks afterwards.those 5 weeks are key. they gave us a time period in which bernie and trump double teamed in their attacks on hillary.he created an illusion among his followers he could still win the primaries (which he couldnt) making their disappointment bigger and bigger.and then we saw the melodrama at the convention where bernies supporters (not all but a lot) behaved like complete and total scum.booing john lewis? booing the mothers of the movement?booing any poc they could?sitting there with their mouths taped and playing the spoiled disgusting drama queens they were?the months afterwards, i made the silly decision to start working for our revolution as a kind of peace offering. i worked on the campaigns of jayapal and teachout.not a single fucking berner wanted to work on those campaigns, instead they obsessed over wikileaks and their immature hatred of the woman that won and the dem party.on the day before the election i wrote a deeply felt passionate plea to the bernie subs here on reddit begging them to vote for hillary.if not for themselves, for minorities, for women, children, muslims, poc, lgtb.i warned them how much trump would hurt us.i was laughed at, yelled at, scorned and ridiculed by the entitled, privileged scumbags who call themselves bernieorbusters.and now, we see everything happen that hillary and we warned for.women, poc, lgtb, children are hurting. and you or any other bernie supporter who voted for hillary are ok, but do not question that :yes bernie did enormous damage to hillary's campaign.he should have campaigned for her from the ca primary on. should not have taken a leave to write his damn book and most of all: he should have addressed his spoiled privileged supporters not once but over and over again to talk some sense into them about wikileaks, russian meddling (bots promoting bernie) and so on and on.and jane sanders should go to hell for her tweet when bernie endorsed hillary and told his supporters to vote for her, they shouldnt always follow/ do what bernie told them to."
7601,7617,1,"most trump supporters are actually nice, if you haven't realized they are still human beings and americans, don't believe that every trump supporter wears white robes and uses n word"
7602,7618,1,"> comey seems to think that mindlessly following rules, traditions, and norms is necessarily ""non-partisan"" and absolves him of any blamehere lies his problem... his conduct during the elections broke every rule and he behaved extremely partisanly (by his own admission) but he still can't admit or address it. his principles were guided by his own personal politics... that's clearer than ever.<for a guy who calls himself the paragon of impartiality and fairness, he seems very interested in ""perception"" and image and the press reaction and hype and optics--to a fault.exactly. spot on. he has this holier than thou attitude he's very proud of... i hope he gets questioned more about his actions during this press tour. he's no martyr."

7625,7641,1,">trump is the enemy because he is a liar and a crook and a thug, and he sits in a position of the highest power.>the idea of american history as an uneven forward march toward greater democracy, despite occasional setbacks and errors, is flatly untrue.>immediately after the civil war, black men were granted suffrage and were able to hold office, in a multiracial democracy. a successful campaign of terror, permitted by a compliant national government and supported by intellectuals, stripped the freed people of their rights and kept them in subjugation for most of the following century. **the country went backwards, savagely and enthusiastically, and stayed there for generations.** the fourteenth amendment was a set of words on paper, with no power to protect peoples rights or their lives against the racist laws and policies that had been put into effect. **the results were so brutal and effective that by the 1930s, the nazis werestudying them as an   exaple of where a country might be able to go.**"
7626,7642,1,"**exhibit a: russia's disinformation campaign**""by one estimate, the russians reached 126 million people on facebook alone. and the kind of phony stories that they spread, claiming for example, that the pope endorsed donald trump or that hillary clinton dealt arms to isis, those kinds of fake news stories actually had more social engagement and reached more readers than legitimate stories in the last three months of the campaign.""  **exhibit b: russia's hacking of voter rolls**""they penetrated voter rolls in at least 39 states. and we know from what the senate intelligence committee said that in a small number of states, but possibly pivotal number of states, they changed the voter rolls, potentially disenfranchising clinton voters who might have showed up to the polls and found out that they were not registered to vote.""**  ""all of these things add up quickly in an election that was decided by fewer than 80,000 votes in three states.""  ****exhibit c: russia's hacking of the democratic national committee and clinton campaign** ""the russians began leaking these massive dumps of stolen emails through wikileaks on the eve of the democratic convention, and the story line that emerged from those stolen emails was the the dnc was biased against bernie sanders. and then the next big tranche of documents was released, very significantly, 29 minutes after the washington post reported on the access hollywood video in which donald trump was heard bragging about grabbing woman by their genitals. and so that last-minute intervention by the russians via wikileaks was incredibly important, which is why donald trump mentioned wikileaks 164 times in the last month of the campaign.  ""nobody would suggest that the russian intervention was the only factor behind the election outcome, but if you talk to experts like **former fbi agent clint watts, what he will tell you is that if it were not for the russian intervention, donald trump would not have been within even striking distance of hillary clinton.****""i think we have great cause to fear for the security of our elections in 2018 and 2020.** donald trump benefited from the russian intervention in 2016, donald trump probably would not be president if it weren't for the russian intervention in 2016, and he shows very little interest in opposing the russians.""

7683,7699,1,"> if you walk around and think every white man is privileged you are part of problem.i never said this. nobody actually ever says this. they say (something like) having white skin is a privilege.  that's different than legit thinking that all white men are privileged. i mean, obviously, we people in los angeles don't think this.  we see white homeless folks every day.  the right willfully misinterprets this, just like they did with black lives matter (too)... not (only) black lives matter.  to be honest, i'd like there to be a better word than 'privilege,' because it gets easily misinterpreted... but, then, when you have a massive machine trying to discredit liberals who want to get rid of the bigoted oppression of individuals based on what 'group' they belong to, any phrase you use will get twisted to be intentionally misunderstood.   ""sad to say but democrats since 2016 are just as racially divisive as your average republican.""  this is far from true.  most republicans voted for trump.  he is a fascist bigot who openly stated he wanted to ban all muslims from entering america.  you are engaging in a false equivalency.  ""its not about privilege, race or gender."" for people who are oppressed, daily, based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion?  yes, it is about that.  a poor black dude faces oppression that a poor white dude does not.  this doesn't mean a poor white dude has an easy life - that's not how existence works.  like, the fact that my skin color doesn't cause me to be oppressed... that doesn't mean my life is sunshine, roses, gold, and happiness. it's just that society does not oppress a poor white dude because of his whiteness. the greatest trick ever pulled was to oppress people based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion... and then, when folks try to fight back against identity-based oppression, yell that the folks pushing back against that evil are the ones engaging in divisive 'identity politics.'

7726,7742,1,"this sums up the article nicely:""trump has been described as a white supremacist since he began his political career""crazy how he was never described as racist before. dated a black woman. won that ellis island award. etc.if the left keeps dwelling on this fabricated bullshit they'll never get back on top."
7727,7743,1,"bruh, you drank the kool aid. her policies were great. the eventual dnc platform was the most progressive in the party history. the problem was that if you told someone that hillary supported something, theyd come right back with nuh uh shes just saying that to get votes, even when it was trivial shit that almost any democrat would support. people were seriously acting like shed become a hardcore republican upon taking office. her track record says otherwise.

7828,7844,1,"nothing, it's up to her and she's already made it clear she won't run again.there are very good other possible candidates like kamala harris, cory booker, gillibrand, murphy, and so on."
7829,7845,1,"susan collins slams the democrats for trying to ""use a survivor to advance a political agenda"", then proceeds to vote for the abuser who assaulted that survivor. the gop is full of hypocrites.and joe manchin is a bag of garbage as well."
7830,7846,1,i just hope she keeps the power to stand on her two feet let alone lead a country! lol
7831,7847,1,"""entire nation already ruled that out for her"" - that's revisionism. you said it."
7832,7848,1,and cortez was volunteering and supporting for bernies campaign. why do you think bernie isnt? what is he then?
7833,7849,1,you don't know where i am now do you?
7834,7850,1,"""but fie on purity tests!"""
7835,7851,1,i watched aretha franklins and john mccain's respective services and i will say this they started at the same time and by the time the processional had finished on aretha franklin's ceremony the john mccain's congressional service had already ended. 
7836,7852,1,i presume it's someone from pence's circle. if trump was removed he'd become the us president. #lodestar
7837,7853,1,"""like some meme on instagram.""  perfect.  as a millennial, i'm often bothered by the articles blaming my generation for everything, but my generation needs to realize life isn't one big meme.  stop normalizing trump by making everything into a meme.  this isn't a joke.  this is real, this happening, and so much is at stake.  and so many people in my age group just don't care."
7838,7854,1,i am thoroughly disturbed by that image.
7839,7855,1,"i live in a very conservative area that voted against her. i asked why to most. they all believed she was too strict on guns. i asked several dozen conservatives in my area would they support democrats if the democrats laid off on gun control. most of them said yes. the older i get and the more i spend time and learn about people the more i realize they all do want good healthcare, better education, more benefits. what they dont want is the government telling them what to do (guns being the top issue). my own father refused to vote hillary because he didnt want her to pick a supreme court justice thats against gun rights. "
7840,7856,1,i just hope she keeps the power to stand on her two feet let alone lead a country! lol
7841,7857,1,"love you, too "

7843,7859,1,"i don't want to have a discussion with you because you can't read. literally you have failed to comprehend the current article, other relevant current articles and the ones you have linked. or you are just not reading.what do you want me to do? i'm not here to be your cliff notes."

7848,7864,1,"never change, hillary."
7849,7865,1,"there is no ""war on christianity.""  i was really disappointed in the supreme court though.  rbg said all the right things in her piece though."
7850,7866,1,"> hillary clinton said sunday the late sen. john mccain (r-ariz.) ""really understood in the marrow of his bones what it meant to be an american."" ... > ""he knew that the senate couldn't work if we didn't work together,"" she said.> > ""i think it was heartbreaking to him that -- as he said in the speech he gave right before he voted against repealing the affordable care act, that we need to cooperate. we need to learn how to trust each other again and do better to serve the people who elected us,"" she added. ...> > ""and he was, in every way he knew how, trying to sound the alarm to get all of us as americans to understand that if we abandon the ideals that we have stood for around the globe, if we turn our back on leadership on behalf of human rights and the kind of future we want to forge for our children and grandchildren, we will be giving up on what he fought for, what he was imprisoned for, what he stood for, and in a long line of american patriots,"" she said.wise words from a great woman."
7851,7867,1,"murkowski's been pretty reliably pro-choice; that's the area where she most commonly breaks from the gop, that and education"
7852,7868,1,both.  give it a read.
7853,7869,1,true. 
7854,7870,1,"no she in fact didnt.but you're too stupid to inform yourself, so why bother."
7855,7871,1,"sigh.. what was an enjoyable lunch break is being ruined as i sit here and listen to this guy next to me talk to his colleague...""for the most part i don't like anything trump has done but at least he's not hillary."" ""i did like his tax bill though."" ""i used to be a liberal democrat but a few years ago i became conservative.""""liberals have shouted racism so much that it's lost its meaning and now people are more racist."" bla bla bla ""identity politics."" then he went on to say again that he doesn't like trump and how polarizing trump is and that when he and his wife were traveling internationally last year people would ask where they're from and he'd say american and they'd roll their eyes at him with ""ooh, *trump*"" and he that didn't make him feel good and was embarrassing. so he's conservative, used to be liberal just a couple years ago, and hates trump. but hates clinton more? i can't imagine what clinton did to make him ""never hillary,"" especially when he was liberal just a few years ago, but whatever it was, why not also be ""never trump"" if he's so aware to how awful and embarrassing trump is? i just don't get it. "
7856,7872,1,"how am i trolling, and why are you making this about race...?all i want is for progressives to get into office and achieve policies for the benefit of americans. is that trolling? also, i support welder more because he has a proven honest record. he doesn't take corporate pac money, and has energized an entire grassroots movement around him. what's not to like?"
7857,7873,1,yes queen!
7858,7874,1,that man is a true patriot!
7859,7875,1,patriotism>nationalism>fascism. 
7860,7876,1,"""renate alumni""that's the part that has him dead to rights. because he can't even fess up and apologize for that. instead he still wants to pretend like he was some straight-edge kind-hearted kid. the joke is obvious and clear to everyone. it's right there in plain view where literally the whole country can see it and kavenaugh is still peddling bullshit and conservatives are still pretending to buy it.the fact that half this country will pretend to believe him and far too many more will humor this bullshit is why we are in this kind of mess in the first place.this entire ordeal is predicated on bad faith as is the rest of our politics."
7861,7877,1,"again, you don't like old folks with one political stance, but do like old folks with another.  whatever correlation or causation there may be, your issue is with political stance, not age.  there are plenty of senators in their 40s-60s who are more conservative than feinstein or pelosi, and just as if not more stuck in their ways.  "
7862,7878,1,"she sold coasters in 2016 that had the story of a drinking contest, having vodka with john mccain."
7863,7879,1,lol. if susan sarandon cared about progressive causes then maybe she shouldn't have campaigned against someone who would have prevented the destruction of progressive causes. she has done nothing but put back progressive causes.... getting arrested won't change that.
7864,7880,1,"maybe because of the ""black lives matter"" movement and the ""me too"" and the lgbt community always wanting to put themselves out there because they want to be.. oppressed? it's a weird thing, but i agree with trump. white men nowadays are looked at as ""privileged"" or a lesser person. black people can say cracker freely but if a white person says nigger they get beat up. if you really think that in today's world, white men, make sure theres a men there, are less oppressed than every other community. you are simply delusional."
7865,7881,1,i wish she ran instead of hillary
7866,7882,1,i remember cohen making a huge deal about how that part of the dossier was wrong. he put a picture of his passport on [twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelcohen212/status/818991277685567489?lang=en) (like that somehow proves something) and said he had never been to prague.so why lie about that? hmmmm...
7867,7883,1,youre a goddamn liar and youre not even good at it anymore
7868,7884,1,"i think it's important that the actions of the gop as a whole are categorically rejected by voters.most of all i just want to express to the person i was replying to that whatever disagreement there is between moderate democrats and progressives, it pales in comparison to the gulf between all democrats and republicans. it is kind of offensive that someone would suggest the more progressive democrats are a wedge that can be used to peel off some more support for this republican party.and honestly i don't see why any decent person would remain associated with republicans at any level. it's not like local government happens in a vacuum. they still live in this country and are seeing everything we are seeing every single day. quietly supporting what the national gop is doing is not okay."

7870,7886,1,"(normally not a fan of the washington times, to put it mildly, but this article seems completely objective, so good on them.) "
7871,7887,1,we already have secure borders. you've drunk the kool-aid. well done.
7872,7888,1,did trump hold any office? schwarzenegger?  jesse ventura? ronald reagan? chelsea is immensely more qualified than any of them just being chelsea.
7873,7889,1,"the facts are, whether you like them or not, kavanaugh will be voted in.  this circus around his nomination and hearing makes me want to become a trumper.  i did not vote for trump, but i didn't vote for clinton either.  i'm just really sick about the state of politics in general right now.  "
7874,7890,1,yeah the last thing you want is various parties working together for a common goal. much better to have a stalemate and throw barbs at each other. 
7875,7891,1,the only problem is that the quantum physics is not completely understood yet...at least last time i read about it.
7876,7892,1,"i think in the end it may be a blessing in disguise. everyone knows including trump supporters, whether they would admit it publicly or not, that she was infinitely more qualified and would have done a much better job.also the amount of obstruction and benghazi/email investigations would have been offensive and disgusting. plus the russia investigation may not have been perused as it should be had hillary won.hopefully we win the midterms and then crush 2020 and take back everything we lost and much more like medicare for all, free college, and legal marijuana. "
7877,7893,1,it was her turn.
7878,7894,1,"i wish she would have won all along.  however, it would have been miserable with a repub congress.  they were already talking about impeachment, and that was before she was elected."

7880,7896,1,"he murdered because he actually believed the caravan heading for the us is funded by soros and that theyre about to invade the us.the whole hype about this caravan, the suggestion there are middle eastern terrorists in it, is spread by trump.those conspiracy theories which leads unstable people to murder are directly spread by trump/ foxnews.so it doesnt really matter whether or not this person is anti trump, the climate of hate and conspiracies is created by trump/fox."
7881,7897,1,that's a slightly better medal imo than trump's commemorative one for the nk summit that never was.
7882,7898,1,did you not read the article? it was grassley who released the records.
7883,7899,1,">i just think it's strange to imply that there was some kind of witch hunt for a career politician who made some bad decisions while in office.well can you name any other career politician who's been subjected to the same scrutiny and false accusations? i mean bernie has been in office longer than hillary was and he barely faced any scrutiny?>especially the whole point of they had ""nothing."" i mean by that logic trump is a wholesome guy with all the investigations into him that have led to nothing.the whole point of they had ""nothing"" is because all the investigations actualy proved nothing about her. trump? he was dirty even before he went in to office and that's been proven. and all the investigations since then have proved he's dirty af and there's certainly nothing wholesome about hjim so who are you trying to gaslight here? are you fucking delusional or are you trying to gaslight folks?"
7884,7900,1,"> "" the trump-russia investigation needed to be kept secret because the people under investigation didnt know that the f.b.i. was on to them. to reveal it would have imperiled the investigation. "" which is why the correct thing to do would've been to say absolutely nothing about the new lead unless it actually turned up something (which it didn't). by attempting to keep the fbi nonpartisan *he made it partisan*. and if the ny fbi would've leaked it? that's his fault too. he ran the organization. he couldn't get his house in order and it led him to make a distinctly hooverian decision. the *only* argument i'm even somewhat sympathetic to is that lynch shouldn't have met bill on the tarmac and put him in the position where the fbi had to take the lead on the case. but even in that instance, he didn't have to campaign against clinton. what really pissed me off about that interview tonight was his line about the public needing to be accountable for for electing trump. motherfucker played a *bigger role than goddamn anyone* in making that happen, and all he does is make excuses for it.current news and conversations are kind to comey. i sincerely believe, and hope, that history will *not be.*"
7885,7901,1,that's one of the really scary ways in which trump really acts like hitler.if you ever wondered how in god's name people could murder 6 million fellow human beings: because the nazis spent years dehumanizing jewish people. they werent thought of as people anymore but as vermin.if you dont understand the danger of foxnews stating the immigrants carry smallpox and other diseases: read up on what hitler said about the diseases jews carried...
7886,7902,1,"i mean... donna brazile literal response to warren's comments was to clarify that it wasn't rigged.>brazile: i don't think she meant the word rigged, because what i said, george, as you well know, after i left this show back on july 24th, i said i would get to the bottom of everything. and that's what i did. and i called senator sanders to say, you know, i wanted to make sure there was no rigging of the process. i'm on the rule and bylaws committee. i found no evidence, none whatsoever."

7939,7955,1,1. shes old and out of touch. so are most senators and many house member. shes been in her position for a long long long time sense 1992 thats before i was even alive! and im 22 what could she possibly understand about me or any of the issues im facing or voters 4 years younger then me who are 18? people tried to make a thing about hillary and bernies age who are 70 and 74! feinstein is 84 years old.  2. because of this shes resistant to new ideas like legal weed and health care of all and not taking corporate money. her policies for being california representative are not as liberal as they should be. her positions are what id expect of a wisconsins senators democrat not californias!. and shes only recently updated her opinions during primary season. that bugs me even more because it shows she a fake. that ether she still doesnt believe these new opinions or if she does she was to scared to admit them before she had pressure from her opponents.

7964,7980,1,"that doesn't answer my question. just because you are a progressive doesn't mean you are more successful than democrats.besides it's easy to fling dirt at others for their perceived shortcomings, if you haven't actually proved to be better at the job yourself."

7966,7982,1,"let me explain why i find the article offensive: since the primaries started this year we've seen a long list of young, often female and often poc candidates win their primaries.i mean from mcgrath, to underwood, gina ortiz, lizzie fletcher, connor lamb and for example danica roem and abrams: they are all the future of the dem party.that includes ocasio cortez btw.but the way in which the bro media is drooling over her is offensive to all those other candidates.no ocasio isnt the future of the dem party.i also think its important to note she's quickly losing support among poc for example due to her ridiculous behavior."
7967,7983,1,"this is like the old trick of asking a candidate ""so how long have you beaten your wife?""there is no evidence of any spousal use, but simply throwing the accusation tarnishes the accused.or it's like me asking you ""so how long have you been cheating on your taxes?"" simply asking that tarnishes you, and it's both time consuming and difficult to prove you *aren't* cheating on your taxes.the clinton foundation ""scandals"" talk is no different.

7973,7989,1,the supporters of jim jones did the same thing. cults are like that
7974,7990,1,"hillary clinton has been the subject of nearly three decades of endless partisan witch hunts and investigations, she released *decades* of tax returns, and the internal communications of her and her staff have been leaked for the world to pick through. none of this deluge of information produced a single actionable charge against her.  clinton was infinitely more transparent and exposed than any other candidate in history.and yet, despite all this, large numbers of people still just assume she must be corrupt and it's only a matter of time before something is found.  the double standard that exists for clinton is absolutely insane. trump and the gop would not have survived for five minutes under this kind of scrutiny. trump (and bernie sanders, for that matter) won't even release his tax returns for christ's sake."
7975,7991,1,"there's two ways to look at equality: either we all rise to the same level, or we are all lowered to the same level. when men imagine a female uprising, they imagine a world in which women rule men as men have ruled women."

8022,8038,1,he's a conservative but why does that make him an asshole?this way to see anyone with different opinions as the enemy is part of the problem imo.since his article in foreign policy december 2017 in which he describes how he always underestimated white male privilege and so on i actually kinda repect the guy.https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/27/2017-was-the-year-i-learned-about-my-white-privilege/

8035,8051,1,"as a democrat, i know that word is a proper noun and should be capitalized. i can also guarantee that i can beat the president at both a spelling test and a vocabulary test."

8038,8054,1,"when it comes to joy reid, i'm not surprised at all if the campaign is coming from the bernie left because she's been one of the few ""msm"" personalities who's made it a point to continuously call out sanders, especially on twitter, and it triggers his extreme supporters. i think we need to now say that this isn't ""in-fighting"" anymore. the kind of people who are attacking her and many other women and poc on twitter aren't on the same page as other democrats. they're separate. "
8039,8055,1,john mccain is out right now. this means 49-50. one vote turned would be 50-49. so yes

8042,8058,1,that doesnt make it right
8043,8059,1,michael moore has no credibility.
8044,8060,1,but this takes away a tool she could have used in the fight against trump that we've all been waiting on her to start.
8045,8061,1,"but we didn't care about the emails because multiple investigations established that no crimes were being committed and they're was no evidence that national security was compromised.this may or may not be criminal, i honestly have no idea, but it seems pretty fucking intuitive that using an unsecured iphone in 2018 to discuss matters of national security and talk to world leaders is a gross security breach. "
8046,8062,1,would there be evidence?
8047,8063,1,and there will probably be more.
8048,8064,1,"he refused to concede for months after he lost the primaries.he even convinced his politically inexperienced followers he could still somehow flip the convention and win.all those months he double teamed with trump, attacking hillary."
8049,8065,1,"we know hillary would have appointed pro-choice judges.fewer unwanted pregnancies are a good way to reduce the abortion rate, which is why i believe there should be access to birth control and sex education.  however, birth control is not 100% effective.  there are lots of women who have gotten pregnant because it failed or because they forgot to take it one day.  the choice always needs to be there."
8050,8066,1,"the protocol told him to shut up. that was his third door he couldn't see. he broke the protocol twice with clinton and observed it with trump. he chose his role to be overseeing the process and defending the fbi, on the top of just investigating... i understand his frustrations, but he made some very consequential political mistakes."

8052,8068,1,i really liked the things she had to say.
8053,8069,1,vindicated! 
8054,8070,1,"at first i thought you were a concern troll, but you're being so *civil* so i guess not /s"
8055,8071,1,are you aware that tax payer money cannot legal go towards abortions? 
8056,8072,1,"while there is some truth to that, i'd like to point out that risk assessment isn't the strong suit of the republican party either. 9/11 memorials stand as a testament to that. but when 9/11 happened, the democrats didn't help it happen or block the president from doing something to prevent it. "
8057,8073,1,"hey, cool! i'll have to save this tweet. it's nice that you can add tweets to bookmarks now on twitter. don't have to dm myself everything :p"
8058,8074,1,"yeah, i saw this. since i'm an underemployed geoscientist, i loved it, naturally. i've been watching that red tide situation. how much longer can florida stay conservative with massive environmental problems? i dont understand it."
8059,8075,1,corey lewandowski makes fun of a 10 year old girl with down syndrome that was taken from her parents...are we finally allowed to say out loud these people are cruel heartless neonazis?if you ever wondered how the holocaust could happen: this is it.https://mobile.twitter.com/aravosis/status/1009232974913638400
8060,8076,1,"please tell me what exactly has he done ""well"" so far? and not the jobs cause that's obama we're seeing right now. so yeah. what has he done well?"
8061,8077,1,the problem is that the election was decided by an electoral college that is in no way recognizable to the spirit of what the college is supposed to be. the federalist papers describe a body that functions as a check against any unfit or foreign-influence candidates... far different from the math game its used as today that allows both parties to focus on campaigning in just a handful of states.
8062,8078,1,"cool story, bro."
8063,8079,1,this is not good
8064,8080,1,it's okay. i still haven't finished it either. i keep getting emotional and have to put it down for a while.
8065,8081,1,"yes i'm not denying he said any of those things. but those words are not him supporting identity politics... in fact, he uses them as a basis for dismissing identity politics. i mean, he claims he wants to see more latinos and african americans in government but then he immediately dismisses their identity as a factor when in fact he should consider that their identity plays a big role in their politics. he assumes that this lady, just because she identifies as latino and is a woman, doesn't care about economic issues. that's his fallacy there - he can't see that someone who is a woman and a minority can also address economic issues.>and even though you dont like bernie, he is more in favour of women rights, than sarah palin would have been as vice-president... so clearly i have to agree: being black, a latina/-o or a women is not enough.why are you bringing up sarah palin like she's someone i'm using as a litmus test? again, this is the problem with bernie and his die-hards - he uses identity as a litmus test. i supported hillary not just because she's a woman but because she's a woman who reflects progressive values for women and minorities and the population as a whole. i didn't support palin cause she was a woman. i don't admire condoleeza cause she was a woman. you guys need to stop conflating gender in this way and behaving like support for a woman or a minority is just down to the identity.and my problem with bernie is exavctly this - he rails against identity politics yet he's the one who reduces his opponents to their identities. he did with hillary and he's done it with other candidates he's run against in the past. and he's actively dismissed issues that concern women and minorities at the same time. so again, no one is saying that someone should be elected just because they're a woman or black or latino. only bernie is saying that."
8066,8082,1,"holy @*^%!i went to sleep with the news sharice davids had lost and now it turns out she won afterall..not only might she be the first ever native american woman in congress, she's also a lesbian woman and her record/ policies are super feminist.and whitmer won. "
8067,8083,1,"okay but no one is saying that. so what do you want exactly? it's like you're saying they shouldn't just be anti-trump and when we say ""they're not and mostly talk about other stuff"" it's now just ""well people aren't hearing them."" well, sorry. there's a narcissist with the office of the presidency and his own media empire. he's pretty good at getting attention. so yea people who don't pay enough attention only hear about trump. i just don't see how that has to do with democrats, their goals and their messages.hillary talked almost entirely about stuff other than trump but out of an hour long speech the media would grab the few lines opposing trump and play them endlessly. they do that because it gets ratings because people are infatuated with the narcissist. but unless you have a magic trick that fixes that problem i don't know what you want democrats to do about it.further, half this country thinks stand-up comedians are like the pr department of democrats so when they make jokes about trump they think all democrats talk about is trump. i hardly hear my senators mention trump's name unless they are taking specific actions to oppose a specific policy and they virtually always have an alternative. it's not their fault our media sucks. and there frankly isn't an obvious solution here. if there was people would be pursuing it."
8068,8084,1,mcconnell is trash. he's so deep in trump's pockets. total trash.
8069,8085,1,:( that's rough.
8070,8086,1,im eating my feelings.  i dont normally do this.  this might be the most impactful political day since the election.
8071,8087,1,it's his turn. 
8072,8088,1,"i have and they just double down. some of these posters dont even comment for days, so it feels like they come in here to astroturf and divide."
8073,8089,1,they put the trick in trickle down. 
8074,8090,1,"when people state hillary had no message, or think her campaign slogan was im with her, then i know they werent paying attention and dont have arguments based on reality. "
8075,8091,1,i've never liked score cards like these. i feel that it pushes reps to the extreme end of the spectrum \(if they're not 100&#37; then they fund a primary challenger\) and all compromise goes out the window. curious what others think about my concern? would you be willing to support a candidate with a score of 90 or 85?
8076,8092,1,didnt say she did nothing. 
8077,8093,1,my personal favorite was the /r/eldertrees thread that insisted she wanted to drug test every student in america.  bernie people fell for every bullshit hit piece about her hook line and sinker. 
8078,8094,1,"yeah definitely operating on different dimensions... specifically where you're talking about someone about whom you clearly have no idea about apart from hearsay and prejudiced propaganda/narrative. which is sad.the fact that you're reducing her career down to connections and ""list of favors"" proves your perception of her. you won't give her credit for her accomplishments because she was wife to bill. and also you make false claims to support your perception which is really disingenuous - to you the only reason she was senator was because she pulled strings... have you even taken a moment to look at what she did as senator of ny?and btw she did run against primary candidates - they lost the first time and even harder the second time because she served ny well. there's a reason they love her in ny.  you're insinuating a lot of things here... why don't you back them up with facts?and yes she did win handily in the 2016 primaries - she beat bernie by almost 3 million votes - that's not close at all. in 2008 she lost to obama by less than300,000 votes. so yes her victory in the 2016 primary was more than comfortable. if you disagree and want to imply it was rigged (like y'all usually do) then provide receipts instead of hurt egos.you might not like her but at least you should know some facts about her instead of resorting to the tired ""establishment"" bullshit. i don't like bernie and i can give you a list of facts why. you're even making up shit about her senate primaries now. that's ridiculous. at the least you should be able to justify your hate for her on actual facts.>the more left populists like osc win, the more people recognize they can win and succeed that way, until even the party can't fail to recognize it. yeah sorry but aoc winning in ny isn't an indication of the leftist populist movement across the country and that's been proven with a lot of primary wins.  the party isn't going to automatically endorse far left candidates accross the country because states like ny elect them. and regardless, populist candidates have been running and they've lost - why can't you accept that? bernie lost. and a lot of the candidates he endorsed lost as well. at the end of the day you can't look beyond the party when it's about your beliefs - sorry but there are democrats who are not ""far left"". and we're going to elect people who are not ""far left"". the label of ""socialism"" only matters to you guys cause we're for policies that are leftist and liberal. "
8079,8095,1,"well, i tried. the relationship between liberals and conservatives is probably the central political issue in this country, and by far the most divisive. you challenged me to get a discussion started, that was my topic - relevant to this interaction and relevant to the current state of our country and its future. also related to comments you already replied to. you responded like a troll. yes, i am lecturing you, and you need it. most people, conservatives included, agree on a pretty logical next step on most policy issues. there's not a big divide as far as needs and sense of morality. it's an issue of respect and appreciation of other people. you don't have it. also getting the feeling i've been going back and forth with a high schooler who hasn't been around long enough to develop a mature perspective on things. am i right?"

"
8149,8165,1,"you don't think bernie would have been smeared?  trump smeared all the other republicans in the primaries, he smeared hillary.  you can bet your ass he would have gone after bernie and that his cult would have as well.and for the record, hillary beat bernie by a few million votes in the primaries.  and i can't speak for all hillary supporters, but i hate bernie because he's basically a left wing version of trump - full of hatred and anger, has a huge cult that will go to great lengths to defend him, constantly trashing the establishment and corporations (politics is an expensive business and not everyone is like trump and can pay for it all themselves), trying to run for president in a party he wasn't involved with (and that bernie attacks every opportunity he gets), over the top plans that are unrealistic and that aren't fully detailed, want to be president despite never doing anything of substance in politics and seeming to be in it because they want the title and prestige more than anything.  bernie never did anything of substance in congress.  people like trump and bernie claim to hate the establishment, but what they really hated was that there were people who had more power than they do.  they complain about corporate donations, but like i said, politics is expensive and most people can't do it all themselves.  just don't let who gives you money direct what decisions you make."

8240,8257,1,thats perfect.
8241,8258,1,"also abortion isn't considered murder in the bible. if you believe god's word is the sole determiner of what does and does not constitute murder, god says the induced miscarriage of a fetus is not murder. literally old testament law prescribes a punishment for injuring a pregnant woman and causing a miscarriage: it's a fine.yet evangelicals want us to believe that god got it wrong, that somehow things changed and now abortion should be the same as murder.here's an easier explanation: they're an illegitimate heretical religion who, like the [""positive christians""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/positive_christianity) built their religion as an instrumentality for their political goals. anti-abortion politics came before the so-called ""moral opposition"" to it, not the other way around."
8242,8259,1,"well, there you go. the truth comes out. a black guy followed by a woman was just too much."
8243,8260,1,"deplorables \\\_()\_/ whenever trump says some outrageous shit, no one bats an eye because theyre so use to it.but hillary says one thing slightly non-pc and every single person in america knows about it."
8244,8261,1,one of the best statements over the past tweets over the past few days.
8245,8262,1,"you're playing tug of war. the other team is winning. you are cursing at the folks standing in front of you for not pulling hard enough and you've given up pulling with them out of spite.bill clinton was a centrist, hillary was always well to the left of him. "
8246,8263,1,i'm really glad that obama and clinton are stepping up their support for the democrats for the upcoming mid terms - the timing is not a coincidence. unfortunately the importance of their participation says a lot about how the direction of the democrats since nov 2016 - they capitulated to internal politics instead of building leadership. 
8247,8264,1,trump/bernie talk.the term identity politics in itself is racist af.
8248,8265,1,how does that contradict the article? they bred cynicism among democrats to cause them to not vote.
8249,8266,1,rosenstein to resign. screw that. make trump fire you. no doubt trump has someone in mind that will end the mueller investigation. this is the most crooked administration in the history of the united states.
8250,8267,1,"> i chose you but i was addressing all of you.don't do that. respond to my comment, i am not responsible for anyone else. >don't you think it's time to start pulling back to the left just a little bit?i just don't want any socialists. so i don't want aoc, or any other idiots from the dsa, to be the future of the democratic party. if the people choose socialists as the leaders of the democratic party then i will leave. pretty simple. i don't think i am alone in that. >don't you want these things? seriously. don't you?my dude, i want capitalism. i don't want socialists who don't understand the unemployment rate trying to tell me what is good policy. i like some of those things, i don't like some of the other things.like i said earlier, it would be easier to just respond to individuals instead of ranting at me like you know who i am. "
8251,8268,1,look at my history or i can show it i backed hillary like crazy! on this sub the whole primary seasons and presidency run. but its time for feinstein to go! she had to be pushed like crazy just to accept legal weed! when her own state passed it by a lot! shes not liberal at all. 
8252,8269,1,"and what is the status quo, when a minority of a population can garner more votes than a larger population/state? what is that status quo when african americans vote less in 2016 than in 2012? what is that status quo when people dont vote in general? and finally what is that status quo when congress is controlled by one party? and in a bigger picture the status quo against whom?"
8253,8270,1,"well, there you go. the truth comes out. a black guy followed by a woman was just too much."

8256,8273,1,"that evil kebbler elf. whenever someone uses ""liberty"" in a religious group they really mean the liberty to discriminate against others. very christian."
8257,8274,1,"it seems trumps shocking performance in helsinki was beyond the pale for **ryan**.https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/1018952179678400512https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17577256/trump-putin-meeting-paul-ryan-statement>of course, ryan is leaving congress at the end of his term, so he has more political freedom to lambaste trump. he **joins other republicans on their way out** of washington, like sen.jeff flake(r-az), who have had no problem going against the president.very tepid ""lambasting""!"
8258,8275,1,not before people got to enjoy the schadenfreude. 
8259,8276,1,here is a link to an article about how much money in heloc resets occurred between 2014 and 2017.  https://www.ezlandlordforms.com/articles/news/382/billions-in-helocs-due-to-reset-from-2014-2017-fueling-fears-of-a-coming-storm/.   111 billion dollars worth of heloc resets between 2014 and the end of 2017. but the first 50 plus billions in heloc resets occurred during obama's second term. in terms of geography. lets not forget that republicans won something like 90% or higher of the total land area of the united states. so trouble with heloc resets could have occurred in many republican leaning areas of the country.
8260,8277,1,"you're kidding right? obama set the economy up to do well, stop watching fox news idiot."
8261,8278,1,"a scotus nominee from hillary, or really anyone but trump, never would have gotten away with this."
8262,8279,1,"the moment ocasio steps out of their little box they will turn on her too.  they like women cheerleaders, not women leaders.  and if she doesn't step out of their box she will be as math-challenged as bernie."
8263,8280,1,"well, lets kavanaugh have his polygraph test too and see how well he does. "
8264,8281,1,"sure i guess some of those were mistakes. but a statistically insignificant drop in an ocean of people who did not vote for her is hardly a reason to hate somebodies guts or damn them to hell. by the way some of your claims about bernie not frequently or forcefully telling his voters to vote for hillary when he started campaigning for her are demonstrably not true. and even hillary said he was an effective and hardworking campaigner for her after the primary, in her book.oh and if bernie holding out for so long was so influential to her losing then why was she so far ahead of trump up until a few weeks before the election?"

8271,8288,1,"remember when barbara bush said [this](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/working-very-well-for-them/) about the victims of hurricane katrina?> and so many of the people in the arena were underprivileged anyway, so this is working very well for them.i know it's lately been fashionable on reddit to romanticize the bushes, and it's rude to speak ill of the dead - but she isn't dead yet.barbara bush was as smug, out-of-touch and indifferent to the plight of common americans as the rest of her clan. a direct line can be drawn from the corrosive bush dynasty, karl rove and their neocon cronies to the corrupt gop traitors that are occupying congress and the white house today. this family helped make a trump presidency possible."

8288,8305,1,"as a bernie supporter i agree, and a good start would be for people to stop rejoicing either side's defeats and focus on ideas instead of personalities because the r side (including libertarians) are firmly united under the orangutan (no offence to orangutans) on the basis of ideas. "
8289,8306,1,"agreed on both sides. we had bush, clinton, bush, clinton (running and lost), obama (obviously beat clinton), then we had both clinton and bush running (both lost) and ended up with trump. america isn't huge on long term dynasties but the bush and clinton family sure did give it a run. for 20 years we saw 1 of 2 names lead the country and then they still ran and personally i am glad both lost. i'd be happy if neither a bush or a clinton won another presidency.

8345,8362,1,"one of the reasons the obama administration may have seemed so ""corporatist and neoliberal"" in effect is that any policy remotely leftist was blocked by the gop congress.  remember, obama only had half of one term (heck, even less after the death of kennedy) to enact his policy changes, and in that time he was almost entirely focused on healthcare reform (with consumer protection being his other achievement).  you play the cards you're dealt.

8458,8475,1,"as much as i love her and sometimes i wish she would run for president again, she can't. people's minds are too poisoned against her, even those who agree with her policies, and that's not going to change. "

8460,8477,1,"it should also be noted that the investigation into benghazi lasted two years, clinton testified at, and resulted in zero indictments.it should also be noted that in the years before the attack obama asked multiple times to increase spending on embassy security and every single time the republican controlled congress refused."
8461,8478,1,"nobody is telling you what you should be concerned about. i'm telling you what i am concerned about, which is the left devolving into a competing tapestry of identity interest groups without any synergy, which is precisely what you are doing when you label me a ""white guy"", imply that i am ""telling [you] what [you] should be concerned about"", and assuming that i ""get mad at women for 'leading men on'"".actually, i'm extremely familiar with the problems that aggressive male sexual behaviour cause for women. i've listened to my partner describe harassment on the street and in public locations by men on a daily and weekly basis for as long as i have known her. the real question is how to improve the situation, and while i don't have a firm answer for that i know that addressing the question will be ten times harder with a republican president, house, and senate. by driving people away from voting democratic because they see us as a minority-interests voting bloc obsessed with identity politics we are, in the long run, preventing these issues from being addressed."
8462,8479,1,its crazy how different this whole political climate feels a year since the release of what happened. hillary made a lot of concessions in that book about the faliures of her campaign but now it all seems like miniscule problems compared to the corruption of this administration.

8464,8481,1,"i strongly disagree.  for one, the democratic candidate will only need to pick up pa, wi, and mi over what clinton won in 2016.  those states are already shifting back into our column.  it seems unlikely that unless we did something profoundly stupid (e.g. nominated sanders) that we would be at risk of losing any of the states that clinton won in 2016.next, your argument almost has to be that you think trump would beat any woman who runs. the candidates in the poll span the (democratic side of the) political spectrum.  sen. klobuchar is so moderate that in mn she has a >50% approval rating among men, women, democrats, republicans, and independents.  obviously warren is at the left side of the party, but she likely has a strong appeal in the midwestern states that went for sanders in the 2016 primaries.  then harris is (probably) somewhere in the middle, with the additional advantage of having only 4 years in the senate minoritythere arent a lot of votes to hold against her.if one of those three cant win, i dont know who can."

"
8480,8497,1,ny wouldn't be one of the bluest states without a progressive governor. nixon had progressive ideas and rhetoric but no track record. i'm sure ny voters would have taken her more seriously if she had done something like run for congress first. you can't call her a progressive governor based just on her rhetoric.  and this will be the trend everywhere - aoc was one high profile win but clearly democrat voters are not about electing candidates on populist rhetoric alone. 
8481,8498,1,"actually she won the popular vote in the 2008 primary but obama got 230 more super delegates.so the sequence is, ""win the popular vote but have a non-democratic entity give the win to someone else, run again, win both the popular vote and the non-democratic entity's vote on the second go round""."
8482,8499,1,"rump's intended consequences, as ordered by his russian masters, is to ruin everything in america that he possibly can, as fast as he can. and mess up anything else he can get his hands on along the way. it's the only explanation that makes any sense at all of the facts we see. 0_0"

8585,8602,1,> worrying overmuch about policy detail is actually sort of useless until that situation is on the horizon.actually worrying about policy detail is anything but useless and this where the problem lies at the moment.populist politics is extremely dangerous - we're seeing it with trump right now. we've seen it with the germans pre-wwii when their brand of populism failed and allowed extremists to take over. that's what is happening now.populism is dangerous whether its from the left or the right. there's no point in electing candidates on the basis of their rhetoric if they can't deliver once in office. populism feeds the masses without actually providing actual solutions. it's a power play tactic. if the voting public actually care about how laws are changed then they should care enough not to vote on rhetoric alone because we all know that fizzles out eventually. policy detail is exactly the thing we need to be thinking about in progressive candidates. for far too long we've had so called progressive candidates who have been elected on their rhetoric and then have failed to deliver once in office. you call it the establishment but they did exactly what people like aco are doing now to get elected.they use populist rhetoric to get elected and then stay in office for years without doing anything. this is exactly the thing we should be fighting against.i like her message. i want that message from a younger politician but i don't want it from someone who has no track record or experience of getting shit done.

8603,8620,1,"it may be winning but it's using politics of fear. and as much as it's about hillary, it's more about the right's fear of the most powerful person on the other side of the aisle. that's why they demonized obama for 8 years. they demonized al gore. hillary is the only one who persisted against them. they'll do the same to bernie and anyone else who ends up leading the democrats. it's naive to think otherwise and make this just about hillary.the only reason fox news is still obsessed about hillary is simply because despite her loss she is still the most powerful voice on the democrats' side. you want her to get out of the public eye? heck, even when she was out of it, they were obsessed about her. donald trump wouldn't have beaten any other candidate? you know that for a fact right? you know that cause bernie was scrutinized by the right and fox news? the truth, which is difficult for fox news, gop and bernie bros to accept, is that hillary's loss didn't reflect the will of the majority of the country. her loss was because of a flawed system. and at the end of the day, she stepped away, and took her time and no one has stepped up to take charge in an adequate way. so she's still the most powerful voice."

8613,8630,1,"bernie sanders took money from super pacs. he took money from people who worked for corporations. but for bernie you don't count that as ""corporation"" donations. when hillary got money who worked for corporations it's lumped in as ""corporate donation"". and there was $27 donation limit. $27 was a selling point. he got donations far more than that from individuals. i don't understand this revisionism. >because i give money to corporations in exchange for goods and services, i can't be against their use of whatever money they want influencing politics? no, that's just part of living in the us in 2018.no i'm sorry, you don't get to excuse it as ""living in the us in 2018"". you give money to companies and contribute to their profit. if these companies then use their profit to influence politics, you don't care? that's hypocrisy. if you're against ""corporate money"" then why do you contribute to it? you do realize your money is playing a part in all of this? "
8614,8631,1,"oh i agree, but shes got a good enough history of opposing trump that she can survive an abstain vote. if she makes the case that her abstention cancels out mccains and that its in the republicans hands, a lot of independents will be able to stomach that. especially given how much shes opposed the party recently.all just my opinion, but the overgrown scrotum that is the leader of the senate majority has an iron grip on his party. if shes openly opposing potential judicial nominees now without much backlash its because hes letting her.either one of two things happens, imo. shes either saying this because a moderate judge is already en route and she can take the praise from dems and flack from the hard right, or so that she can abstain if a hard right judge is nominated and let pence push it through."
8615,8632,1,and you are two goddamn years too late to still troll this sub
8616,8633,1,"she will ask the nominee, and the nominee will tell her what she needs to here. but every nominee is a member of the federalist society, so we already know they will vote to overturn. cya, susan. but we see you."

(him being a minority still plays into the identity politics argument of the article too, of course.)but it's painfully obvious when you look around that it's largely a misogynistic angle they take.  you have nancy pelosi, maxine waters, kamala harris, elizabeth warren, and even alexandria ocasio-cortez (who isn't even elected yet, but has become the right's go-to for attacking the left).  the amount of coverage waters/ocasio-cortez get given their relative political insignificance is astounding."

8790,8807,1,ive considered the nyt a fairly garbage outlet and completely out of touch with america for a long time now. they absolutely hated hilary and didnt even run a single interview with orcasio-cortez until two days after her upset win... and she lives in the fucking bronx.
8791,8808,1,the poster wasnt asking a question.
8792,8809,1,"i worked for hillary in 2016. the problem wasn't just the far left, it was a lack of energy for her supporters as well. i never had as hard of a time getting volunteers as i did for hillary, even her biggest supporters were so burnt out by the end of the elections that i couldn't squeeze more than one knocking shift out of them.  don't get me wrong, maybe she could've won if the far left came in from the cold, but the fact is that many other candidates would've won handily because of how they motivated their base. this last election shouldn't have been an issue, democrats should've won the presidency easily. "
8793,8810,1,"i read the article and it was poorly written and went all over the place.  a lack of empathy creates entitlement, thats human nature.progressive and liberals have a sense of empathy for the issues women and people of color have.  conservatives speak to the issues of white americans and have empathy for their issues.  the civil rights acts of 64 and 65 created this demographic shift, right or wrong thats the nature of the two parties.being called racist and sexist is what white men deal with within the democratic party.  i personally experienced at the county state and national level with other democrats that i would meet.  denying racism or sexism ive experienced is no different than denying racism or sexism anyone else experiences.democrats need to understand and address the issues white men experience to win elections across the country.  if they want to remain a party for the coasts of the us we are in for a long ride.labeling a white man as entitled without understanding his experience doesnt address the issue democrats face demographically but was a common tactic hillary supporters used and obama supporters did not.  thats why he won and she couldnt.is a homeless white man entitled?  is a working blue collar white man entitled? is a white male war vet entitled?i dont think so.is a wealthy white man who sits at the top of trump tower entitled?of course!  but it doesnt mean every white man is entitled.....

8794,8811,1,these guys look exactly how i would expect them to look. 
8795,8812,1,"true, everything is possible.besides it's really hard to succeed a president of your own party and it's very rare.trump was the new thing, but in 2020 he won't be an ""outsider"" how many people viewed him to be.but i wouldn't even care about him or other republicans and would rather focus on midterm elections."

8861,8878,1,"""qualifications"" are the sort of thing people only get excited about once they already agree with someone politically or want them to win badly for some other reason. then all of a sudden if they're well-qualified, it becomes the big obvious justification for why supporting them is objectively ""right"" and supporting anyone else is objectively ""wrong"" and ""stupid"".since there's never been a woman president, women who cared a lot about that assumed her qualifications would be a huge card to play against her male opponents. but nobody cared, that is, nobody who didn't already think she was a good fit for office based on their own political metrics. so now, like some sort of ptsd cases, her adherents are left insisting ""qualifications"" have always been the best thing to look for in candidates, and it's a big strange absurd farce that the most ""qualified"" candidate didn't win -- even though that happens at least half the time if not actually more.  jfk was less qualified than nixon. reagan was less qualified that carter. bill clinton was less qualified than ghwb. gwb was less qualified than gore."

8895,8912,1,one tweet says it all:https://mobile.twitter.com/angryblacklady/status/1054762053741633536
8896,8913,1,no idea...i only know one thing: these midterm elections might very well be the most important elections ever.even when trump fires mueller and the gop lets him: a blue wave can fix that.
8897,8914,1,"this was my first thought too.it's so complicated thoughthere are so many reasons people abstain from participating. some people feel hopeless, other people feel a false confidence that things will work out, some people think they're powerless and become a self-fulfilling prophecy.exactly what persuades all the non-participators to participate is really unclear to me.that said, i sure hope this helps. and it does seem more likely to encourage participation than discourage it, but that's just my feeling."
8898,8915,1,"how are there people in this country stupid enough to listen to trump drone on about how we couldn't verify iran's compliance with their deal to the point that he discontinued the damn thing, but now believe him when he says nk will disband their nuclear weapons without a single documented plan of how this will be verified?  "
8899,8916,1,"gun control is a superb fund-raising issue, as well as a particularly popular issue among black americans, as they're the ones disproportionately getting shot."
8900,8917,1,"oh really?so that one time mrs privileged left her 9 million dollar mansion to pose for the cameras constitutes doing more than the endless hours of canvassing, demonstrating, phonebanking, attending rallies and meetings most of us here do?i dont think so bud, i think youre sitting on your lazy ass and are projecting"
8901,8918,1,"lmao who cares about sully, he's just some pilot. maybe a good one, but any pilot ever would try to land their plane when it crashed. and the fact that he was a life long republican just makes it clear that he has spent most of his live voting to fuck over poor people, probably not a great guy. not sure why anyone pays any attention to the man."
8902,8919,1,thank you so much for being a reasonable voice through all the noise.
8903,8920,1,im proud i voted for hillary clinton despite some issues i have with her
8904,8921,1,"the only reason there are any car factories that haven't left the us yet is they are hoping this can't last. its impossible for them to be profitable with these tariffs. trump is fucking up us manufacturing for decades, because companies will be afraid to come back even when this is over, because they willl be afraid of paying the set up costs of setting up production only for another psycho coming along and doing this again."
8905,8922,1,we would need the majority. mcconnell plans to get this through before the midterms to ensure that even if that were to happen it will be too late.
8906,8923,1,when the media finds out its a different michael cohen wah wah wah 
8907,8924,1,two great ironies in this:1. comey was trying to protect the fbi's image.2. comey was trying to protect hillary's presidency by preempting complaints that she had won unfairly.
8908,8925,1,"okay but no one is saying that. so what do you want exactly? it's like you're saying they shouldn't just be anti-trump and when we say ""they're not and mostly talk about other stuff"" it's now just ""well people aren't hearing them."" well, sorry. there's a narcissist with the office of the presidency and his own media empire. he's pretty good at getting attention. so yea people who don't pay enough attention only hear about trump. i just don't see how that has to do with democrats, their goals and their messages.hillary talked almost entirely about stuff other than trump but out of an hour long speech the media would grab the few lines opposing trump and play them endlessly. they do that because it gets ratings because people are infatuated with the narcissist. but unless you have a magic trick that fixes that problem i don't know what you want democrats to do about it.further, half this country thinks stand-up comedians are like the pr department of democrats so when they make jokes about trump they think all democrats talk about is trump. i hardly hear my senators mention trump's name unless they are taking specific actions to oppose a specific policy and they virtually always have an alternative. it's not their fault our media sucks. and there frankly isn't an obvious solution here. if there was people would be pursuing it."
8909,8926,1,everything she said in 2016 about trump and the russians was the truth.america's demise will be how the right and left wings brainwashed us against her.
8910,8927,1,"pretty much everything she said during her campaign has been prophetic... and since we're talking about what she said during her campaign, let's talk about how the media ignored most of what she actually said and the lack of coverage her campaign speeches got compared to the uninterrupted live feed they gave trump & bernie. we should remember that when her speeches get brought up two years later,"
8911,8928,1,> do you not understand that the incumbent leadership has become an albatross around the neck of progress?seriously? even with trump rolling back all the progress the people who brought progress are the bad guys??? i mean this is the reason we have trump. such naive thinking.  you lot think it was ok to ditch whatever progress we had because it wasn't according to your pace even though it meant that we would go back to the start.  that's not progress!  amazing after all the shit trump's adminstration is doing that this kind of foolhardy naivety is still prevalent.
8912,8929,1,i hoped things wouldn't be as bad as i feared.  they've been worse.
8913,8930,1,im glad the clintons werent hurt when those devices were found.
8914,8931,1,"i agree, i guess i just fear that we're past the point of no return for warren too. "
8915,8932,1,what's outrageous is that she lost and people are still complaining about her as if she'd won.
8916,8933,1,"this is a must watch. sadly, she provides a lot of info that the media doesn't. https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/maddow-time-for-americans-to-face-worst-case-scenario-on-trump-1278891587866?playlist=associatedmy blog: www.thebeeaintsilent.com"
8917,8934,1,"**women are liars. you cannot trust an *ambitious* woman**no sexism to see here, folks!!!"
8918,8935,1,"you misunderstood my post completely.i deeply despise bernie exactly for this reason: when a dem wins the primary: you support that dem, period!in other words: i support ocasio-cortez and ridicule the assumption in the press that dems will lose the midterms because a socialist is running in a deep blue district.and if you really dont know why people hate bernie after all the shit that happened in 2016, you havent been paying much attention..."
8919,8936,1,"she got 3,000,000 million more votes than the clown we have right now. i'm sure plenty of people are interested in her thoughts or else we'd not be hearing about them. her ""previous statements"" are fake news btw. "
8920,8937,1,"i'm not trying to shut down anything. in fact, i am engaging in a discussion with you about these specific issues that you want to talk about, with the caveat that we need male voters in order to be able to get back into power in order to be able to do anything to help the people we want to help. what are your ideas to stem this problem? go ahead, i'm all ears. i bet that every single thing would be easier to do with a democratic president, and we need male voters to achieve that. ""blame men for mollie tibbetts' murder"" is going to drive them away. there are about a hundred less toxic ways to engage in a discussion about violence against women than starting it with ""blame men"", or trying to counter-troll the right's dumb claim that illegal immigration caused the murder. look, i know that journalists don't write their own headlines, that's fine, but someone chose to put that, and in my view it's utterly toxic. the left should be about uniting people, and bringing people together."
8921,8938,1,"sure use that excuse. when people like you go out of their way to post these kind of comments in this sub, just betrays a whole bunch of insecurity. go ahead."
8922,8939,1,new mueller indictments expected in 5 minutes...while that orange shitbag visits the queen
8923,8940,1,theyve been downplaying everything to the point that im not so sure that therell be a blue wave in november. 
8924,8941,1,why can't people adjust to a new voting location? it's not hard. you're implying that moving the location makes it difficult for democrats to vote.seriously? are they too dumb to figure out where to vote? too lazy? what's your reasoning behind this? 
8925,8942,1,">thestudy from researchers at ohio state universityfinds that fake news probably played a significant role in depressing hillary clinton's support on election day. the study, which has not been peer-reviewed but which may be the first look at how fake news affected voter choices, suggests that **about 4 percent of president barack obama's 2012 supporters were dissuaded from voting for clinton in 2016 by belief in fake news stories**.>the survey also notably doesn't measure what effect fake news might have had on **increasing trump's support**, instead only focusing on how it depressed clinton's. that could increase the shift. but even with this limited purview, it suggests it made a significant difference.>and it suggests **it may well have cost clinton the presidency**."
8926,8943,1,"a more perfect union is in the constitution which was ratified june 21, 1788."

8928,8945,1,"i am becoming a bit concerned with the democratic congressional camapagin committee and it's consistent mistakes. the same time we know this election is a fundamental matter of life and death. we are facing the crisis that we do because republicans  have been highly disciplined and organized. the democratic cause in this moment requires us to do the same. we need to be long-term, strategic, well-financed and well-aligned. we also must act at the local, state and national levels simultaneously and in sync, resolute in each forum in which power is contested: redistricting, legislative action, electoral work, leadership development. we have finally seen that for too long up close what happens when that power is uncontested. most especially here in texas where its considerable damage to our state has lay bear. right-wing control in a majority of states most especially texas has been exploited to draw congressional and state legislative district lines that perpetuate minority voting power to lock in a distorted majority in the u.s. house of representatives and shut democrats out of meaningful presence in state houses. yet at this pivotal moment in time the democratic party seems to have a awkward and disjointed game plan on recruited candidates and electoral strategy. with the myriad of polling recently showing the liar and chief strengthening and democratic candidates generic ballot shrinking something is not aligned correctly.the democrats cannot reclaim power or leadership until we can give voice to the widespread economic insecurities felt throughout america and deliver!! lies  drew some voters, to a con artist lying bastard like trump. however they were effective in the first place because democrats failed to connect, but when the lies and bs implode like we have seen voters will not just vote for dems,  (again recent polling) unless they believe we can deliver and i'm afraid we are potentially screwing ourselves out of yet another election that is ours to win. this is just frustrating sorry for the rant."

8997,9014,1,"max boot is a smarmy asshole who is decades late to the republicans-are-trash realization. he's a conservative because his parents fled an oppressive regime, and he happily ate up the gop promise that you get to be the oppressor this time. the handful of anti-trump conservatives do not deserve to be promoted to the head of the class.

9000,9017,1,"i question whether any of the stuff he advocates bleeds party constituents.the fact that he hasn't shown proper deference to the party organization obviously hurts him -- in the context of a primary, anyway."

9002,9019,1,fascism is what clinton would have brought you. obama spent $34 million a year to keep us in the dark. that is fascism. https://www.ap.org/ap-in-the-news/2017/obamas-final-year-us-spent-36-million-in-records-lawsuits

9004,9021,1,my educated guess is they exclude liberal voices because that is what their donors want. makes it easier for them to get the legislation hand-crafted for themselves. they pay people to come up with the plans for that exclusion. it's not like all of the gerrymandering that went on in 2011 was the result of the legislators thinking up those things themselves. the big money in this country pays people to do that kind of work and then the gop just makes it official.

""you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race.""and she was right. trump's clear anti-nato remarks have generally aligned with russia's sentiment about the organization; his expressions of admiration for putin have played right into the russian leader's hand.and then came the fated trump-putin summit, and trump's failure to condemn russia for the coordinated cyberattacks during the 2016 presidential campaigns. this was particularly bold given that just last week, the justice department announced the indictments of 12 russian intelligence officials for interference in the election. trump has, once again, proven that clinton's prediction was spot on.heck, there's even a #shewarnedus hashtag on twitter documenting all the times hillary told us how the trump presidency would pretty much unfold from the get-go.with trump's track record, there was no reason to believe trump would not, once again, take russia's side.after today's press conference, democrats and republicans are both speaking out against trump's comments, with house speaker paul ryan stating that ""there is no question that russia interfered in our elections,"" and acknowledging the need to recognize that russia ""is not our ally.""john brennan, the former cia director labeled trump's comments ""nothing short of treasonous.""as members of both parties distance themselves from the president's comments on putin and are largely still absorbing the shock of having an american president openly side with and embrace a known adversary of his country, the one glaring truth we must all accept is that it was possible to see this coming. and hillary clinton did.after witnessing the summit, clinton herself had tweeted a response to her initial question: ""well, now we know,"" the tweet read.she knew all along which team trump would play on -- and by now we should, too. cool people read before commenting "

9172,9189,1,"wait any criticism of them is an attack on women and minorities? look mate, i'm liberal as well, but saying clinton was not a good candidate does not by any means attack all females. likewise, if someone says, i didn't like obama because of ""policy x, policy y, policy z"", that doesn't attack all minorities. i'm a poc myself, and i'd rather have talks that discuss that strengths and weaknesses of all candidates, both past and current, than shy away from it. pointing out their faults does not detract from their accomplishments, obama obviously will go down in history, as will clinton for their strides in their fields, given that they do not match the traditional layout of a male, white politician. they're both accomplished individuals, but that does not make them perfect. those who don't observe history, are doomed to repeat it. i dislike trump, but i think looking at why clinton lost and understanding what happened is key to ensuring a candidate such as trump does not take office.

9890,9907,0,"that's because when leftists are talking about ""white"", they're talking about a specific philosophical approach in which there exists objective order to the universe and nature, in which can be derived through reason and logic. the principle behind science, is that the logos is true. in which the rational mind is simply just trying to understand. this is what many early priests and mystics declared the term, ""made in the image of god"", referred to.the leftists, are all disciples of the pharisees or rabbis. they believe that there is no objective order, but that everything is arbitrary and maintained by arbitrary power structures through material force. this essentially means that all mathematicians, scientists, etc, are all mystics similar to priests of  catholicism. this ""patriarchy"" is associated with white people, because it has been mainly cultivated by catholics and their offshoot denominations since it was a powerful philosophy in rome and greek philosophy. although the idea exists in china, india and many other places. outside of ""white"" nations, it was simply a philosophical idea that remained dormant in favour of emperor worship, or goddess worship and other ideas.

10042,10060,0,"all white males would be quite the sausage party.that being said, you say we can't group everyone into one basket. however, the sad fact is that we can group most people in a basket. we have the data that backs up my claim that legal immigrants vote overwhelmingly for democrats. the trend seems to be there, and it would be foolish to ignore it. why do you think democrats are so strongly pro-immigrant? it has been their plan for a long time to change the country demographically and have the votes to obtain permanent power. most people from the third-world have no tradition of real democracy. they either get cared for by the state or don't get cared for at all. they also come from overwhelmingly corrupt countries. i'm afraid that iraq falls into this category as well. unfortunately, the us intervention there made things dramatically worse in many ways even despite the fact that saddam was a monster. that doesn't mean iraq doesn't have some great individuals, but the country as a whole has obviously not been so great for many of the people who lived there.we can complain about identity politics all we want and try to change it. however, in the meantime, republicans are on course to permanent loss of power. too many immigrants benefit from identity politics and see no reason to give it up. i think it's totally cool that you have embraced american culture and vote to preserve it. the sad fact remains that most immigrants do not. we are apparently not smart enough to sort out those who want to preserve american culture (liberty, freedom, respect for the constitution, etc) from those who do not. until we can really do that, we need to put curb immigration and get our own house in order before we continue to open america's door. if we are going to have any sort of legal immigration, it needs to be a small number of people who can truly benefit america based on merit. not some chain migration mess that invites all the world's poor.

[he met with secret service today at 1 because of this video where he says it](https://youtu.be/mz8ebt4uek4). the courts are rigged all the way up to chief justice roberts to sell our patents to the uk privy council, the gov, and china, they purposely prevent any investigations into our electronic vote machines because those same groups (specifically the uk privy council (who also control soros in this regard)) are the ones that control them. the courts are 100% rigged to allow the election fraud. the most important part of america are our ideas, everything that you see, the world's entire reality is based on american ideas, but the supreme court are allowing them to be suppressed to the tune of 5000+ patents per year. the writ of mandamus above ties in the patent theft and rigged vote machines to foreign election meddling from uk privy council, china, and traitors within the us government. the patent theft ties in because the technology behind social media and the entire modern internet(web 2.0) was stolen from michael mckibbens leaders technology, which went all the way up to the supreme court in leaders technology vs facebook. the supreme court hearing was won by leaders tech in that they proved the tech was stolen by facebook  adn the us government but supreme court chief justice whom had a stake in facebook, ruled that facebook didnt have to pay leaders tech a dime, and gave the case to facebook. turns out all of social media was being predicted by the cia and uk privy council back in 1999 when leaders technology first applied for their patent. it later became the web 2.0 (modern social media internet) after getting partial source code stolen in 2003 (by their own dc patent lawyer). point being, the cia and uk privy council backed social media after stealing it from leaders tech for 2 specific reasons. one was to spy on everyone, and 2 was to manpulate elections!!!! this guy christopher stronk ties it all together in that writ of mandumus. read it & spread it!

[he met with secret service today at 1 because of this video where he says it](https://youtu.be/mz8ebt4uek4). the courts are rigged all the way up to chief justice roberts to sell our patents to the uk privy council, the gov, and china, they purposely prevent any investigations into our electronic vote machines because those same groups (specifically the uk privy council (who also control soros in this regard)) are the ones that control them. the courts are 100% rigged to allow the election fraud. the most important part of america are our ideas, everything that you see, the world's entire reality is based on american ideas, but the supreme court are allowing them to be suppressed to the tune of 5000+ patents per year. the writ of mandamus above ties in the patent theft and rigged vote machines to foreign election meddling from uk privy council, china, and traitors within the us government. the patent theft ties in because the technology behind social media and the entire modern internet(web 2.0) was stolen from michael mckibbens leaders technology, which went all the way up to the supreme court in leaders technology vs facebook. the supreme court hearing was won by leaders tech in that they proved the tech was stolen by facebook  adn the us government but supreme court chief justice whom had a stake in facebook, ruled that facebook didnt have to pay leaders tech a dime, and gave the case to facebook. turns out all of social media was being predicted by the cia and uk privy council back in 1999 when leaders technology first applied for their patent. it later became the web 2.0 (modern social media internet) after getting partial source code stolen in 2003 (by their own dc patent lawyer). point being, the cia and uk privy council backed social media after steling it from leaders tech for 2 specific reasons. one was to spy on everyone, and 2 was to manipulate elections!!!! this guy christopher stronk ties it all together in that writ of mandumus. read it & spread it!

""this is crazy!""in a tuesday interview with politico, lux said he received an email from someone sending a cure affidavit marked with the wrong date that included a florida democratic party email address. the email does contain the email address votes@floridadems.org, which is associated with the party.caroline rowland, an fdp spokesperson, brushed off the issue, saying the scott administrations election office was drumming it up as a distraction.""the courts have already forced rick scott to drop a lawsuit after false claims of fraud, and the florida department of law enforcement rejected his desperate attempts to interfere with the important work of counting ballots, she said in an email. now, scott is once again trying to divert attention and resources from a smooth and successful recount."""

""undervote"" is when a number of voters register their vote for a position in one party but not for another. there is a possibility the ballot mark was made by the voter but not read by the machine. on my ballot in duval county, florida, you fill in the little bubble, just like machine readable test forms in grade school. the manual recount would look for bubbles that were marked for a candidate but were not picked up by the machine. determining this is somewhat subjective, so there is a process to review them (this ties back to the same phenomenon in the ""hanging chad"" election, but in theory is not as prone to abuse. back then, they were arguing whether the voter meant to punch out the card if the little paper chad was still attached).for undervote, look at arizona. way fewer votes cast for mcsally as republican senator than for  republican governor. either there is something fishy here or the primaries made her severely damaged goods - it seems that republicans rejected her."

'far-right parties' only have 30% of voting intentions atm (article linked said they had 25% in august, so 5% increase), with le pen on 21%. macron's lrem has 20% of voting intentions.however, as there are many parties, there are also many left wing ones - the previous president (francois hollande) came from a party called the ""parti socialiste"" which are quite left wing. they are looking at around 6% of voting intentions atm.the european elections are coming up soon (for the european parliament) but the french presidential elections occur every five years (next in 2022), so for france's domestic policy, this doesn't mean too much (granted, a lot of their policy is influenced heavily by the eu).edit: typo"

12197,12219,0,"considering a number of mgtow are christians, myself included, i must entirely disagree with you. the bible itself even warns against foul women, which are in great number these days as many of them have abandoned christian values. it even talks about being wary of a woman who seems perfect, for she is like the rarest rubies. she doesnt exist. ive also met a number of men who later became christian or rejoined the faith after becoming mgtow. we actually had many of them taking about it on a post several days ago, maybe a week. theres nothing wrong with men protecting their assets either. nothing wrong with demanding women, in a world where they declare themselves equal (and above men in many cases) to men, pay for their own meals on a date. they work after all and are entitled to nothing of the mans. our court system sees it the opposite however, and will ruin a man to provide for a woman in a divorce. draining his financial assets, throwing him from his home and in some cases forcing him to sell his home and vehicles. these are the vast majority of divorces cases. divorce itself is at all time highs and most of them are not only initiated by women but, are initiated as no fault divorces. it should also be noted that marriage rates are at all time lows. men see how bad divorce is, how often good men are divorced by good women and have calculated the risks, deeming them to be far to high. this is all ultimately the result of feminism.

[he met with secret service today at 1 because of this video where he says it](https://youtu.be/mz8ebt4uek4). the courts are rigged all the way up to chief justice roberts to sell our patents to the uk privy council, the gov, and china, they purposely prevent any investigations into our electronic vote machines because those same groups (specifically the uk privy council (who also control soros in this regard)) are the ones that control them. the courts are 100% rigged to allow the election fraud. the most important part of america are our ideas, everything that you see, the world's entire reality is based on american ideas, but the supreme court are allowing them to be suppressed to the tune of 5000+ patents per year. the writ of mandamus above ties in the patent theft and rigged vote machines to foreign election meddling from uk privy council, china, and traitors wihin the us government. the patent theft ties in because the technology behind social media and the entire modern internet(web 2.0) was stolen from michael mckibbens leaders technology, which went all the way up to the supreme court in leaders technology vs facebook. the supreme court hearing was won by leaders tech in that they proved the tech was stolen by facebook  adn the us government but supreme court chief justice whom had a stake in facebook, ruled that facebook didnt have to pay leaders tech a dime, and gave the case to facebook. turns out all of social media was being predicted by the cia and uk privy council back in 1999 when leaders technology first applied fr their patent. it later became the web 2.0 (modern social media internet) after getting partial source code stolen in 2003 (by their own dc patent lawyer). point being, the cia and uk privy council backed social media after steling it from leaders tech for 2 specific reasons. one was to spy on everyone, and 2 was to manipulate elections!!!! this guy christopher stronk ties it all together in that writ of mandumus. read it & spread it!

14173,14198,0,"i was visiting the united states earlier this year in may, and while driving from pittsburgh, pa to nokomis, fl i saw a crazy guy do a break check on th i-95 just outside woodbine, ga, on a bridge across the satilla river. it was 8 pm, and very dark.the car in front of mine, on the right lane was occupied by a single middle age woman. she was forced to hit the brakes and steer right into the divider wall of the bridge, crossing all 3 lanes and hitting that wall at high-speed and what seemed to be a 60 angle.my brother was driving, i was in the passenger seat and my mom was in the back. we were was just 5 or 6 seconds behind her, so he was able to swerve and stop some 50 yards in front of her.as we were stopping i told him stay in the car, don't follow me until i call you. i feared that whoever was in the car might be dead or dying, and the incoming traffic did not slow down at all, those maniacs kept going at 80 mph or more.i jumped out of our car, and run as fast as i could on the shoulder of that bridge, with cars zooming by a few feet at my right. it was just a 50 meters distance, but i can tell you, it felt a lot longer. insanity.i approached the accident and had to momentarily step in the high-speed lane. the smell of a crashed car is awful, a mixture of gunpowder, coolant fluid, hot gases, and burnt rubber and plastic. the driver was awake, still recovering from the impact maybe 20 seconds earlier, needless to say she was in deep shock.lucky for her, i am a icu physician, and before that i worked in the er for 12 years. i performed the fastest diagnostics i ever did, and extricated her from the wreckage. no major wounds were evident. she did answer all my questions, with an initial gcs of 15/15.by this time, my brother had come to, and recognizing we were all in great danger, we left the woman, and started moving those road cones some 150 meters before the crashed car. scary stuff.2 other cars stopped on the right side of the road, and one of them was an off duty police officer who called the sheriff. the first emergency vehicle showed up 07:45 minutes after the crash (i timed it), which was just astonishing.as i did a recheck on her before the paramedics arrived, she went into shock. she started asking weird questions, making no sense at all. i was afraid it was a sign of brain trauma, but she was pretty much saved by the airbags, i feared i was missing something.in the end, it was just the fear setting in. i have attended a lot of injured people, but this was one of the very few cases were i saw the accident happen. that kind of fear and shock is hard to comprehend.the troopers arrived, and i calmed them down, letting them know she was ok, and needed an ambulance that was just pulling in. they cut the left lane, and started a little traffic jam, protected us as best possible by parking their cruisers way back, next to were my brother and i marked with the cones.the paramedics confirmed her vital signs, sat her in a big ambulance and, to my shock, the troopers interrogated her right there. i gave them a lengthy statement by writing as well, making sure to describe all her semiological data. i didn't see the assassin who braked check her, just his tail lights.all things considered, we were there for some 50 minutes, exhausted and unable to continue, we had to stop (unexpectedly) at the dirtiest motel 6 in existence, by the jacksonville airport north. i didn't take my shoes off.there is a happy ending, we got to nokomis the next day by noon, a super cute small town on the gulf coast, and we got to spend some 4 days there. visited myakka river state park, and saw many gators. wild stuff ja! ja! ja! ja!"

14280,14305,0,i he was a nk reporter he would have been dead by next morning.
14281,14306,0,"i love that one. science isn't a popular vote or a consensus; there's never anything such as ""settled science"" in science. in that case, then the earth is flat and at the center of the universe. given the best information available at the time, that was what the vast majority of scientists and philosophers all agreed at one point.furthermore, that so-called consensus was arrived at by a highly biased poll that was sent out via email by one woman to collect opinions from certain hand-picked climate scientists around the world that she decided she wanted to include. when she got responses, she additionally hand-picked most of the ones she liked to invent the ""consensus"". yet, so many still throw around those terms and incorrect conclusions from that one flawed, biased polling."
14282,14307,0,"strange, so why isn't brenda snipes and cuffs for violating the order of a federal court judge? why is nobody in cuffs for the on video voter fraud.in fact why is nobody being prosecuted for all the shit that we have found out about over the last 2 years.why because i guarantee if any of us had committed any of these crimes our asses would be in jail right now.we all know swampy sessions and rotten rosenstein we're backing the democrats and covering for hillary but they're supposed to be gone now so what's the holdup.frankly unless trump is able to get this wall built during the lame duck session this wall is not getting built. unless this voter fraud is taken care of with extreme levels of consequences for all who are involved trump is not winning in 2020, it will not matter how many people vote for him they will just flip the election and say ""oh we found some more ballots! fuck you he lost. oh and anyone else we want to lose has lost. because fuck you, what are you going to do about it?""i didn't want to trump is out of office they're going to put in whoever the fuck they want and that giant ass migrant caravan we see sitting outside our border is getting let in and they're going to drop them on every single red state in the union and guess what folks that's it at that point there won't be any more elections. oh we will have a show every few years a nice little round of theatrics. but the fact of the matter is they're going to have enough people to counteract our votes and what they can't counteract will have a much smaller gap they need to close with the fake votes.this is how it all goes down. this is the end game.trump was never supposed to win in 2016, and his victory has caused the establishment and the powers-that-be to panic and this is what their panic mode looks like just naked corruption voter fraud stolen elections and the complete destruction of any possibility of a fair election ever again.honestly if this shit doesn't get handled one way or another i'm just done i'm not voting anymore because there's no point i'm not going to waste my time doing the kabuki play as if anything i do or say or any of our votes will have any meaning whatsoever and aren't just going to be overturned by mass-produced fucking ballots loaded into trucks at 2 a.m from the back of democrat's cars."

14708,14735,0,"thanks for the response. i agree investment is essential, we can't expect a tribe to adopt capitalist ideals and become wealthy nor do i believe i have said anything to suggest that. my main gripe is the misuse of what communism is. it was the inspiration of governments under mao, stalin and such, but these governments followed barely any communist agenda. they were all socialist/fascist. in the same theme, people generalise the usa as the very embodiment of the free-market system. you probably know that it's quite from the truth, heavy regulations, the interest rate is determined, tariffs and protectionism is happening, anti-competitive tactics from companies. i guess i don't like these gross tribal mindsets that frame something in absolutes ""all trump supporters are fascists"" ""all communists are starving"" ""all nazi's supporters want to genocide jews"".   i also wouldn't say the nazi's were strictly national socialists. during times of world war 2, total war was implemented to great effect by countries like germany and great brittain. total war greatly enhances socialist aspects of a country as any and everything that might help win the war is seized indefinitely. so the nazi's have this guise of socialism when in reality, the birth of hitlers party as an autocratic state saw a heavily fascist regime but economically, a mixed socialist and capitalist system where a lot was nationally controlled but also a lot was fueled by hitler's ties to extremely rich german conservatives. its economy was definitely unique. remember hitler fucking hated communists and wanted to expand into russia for german living space. this is a good read https://www.nber.org/chapters/c9476.pdfi guess this is off topic, but i have studied artificial intelligence and automation to a degree. presuming that the next era of progress in humanity starts with the total integration of these forces (the automation era, where we can 3d print organs are a thing and every entity can be better controlled by a program than a human) would it make capitalism and socialism more viable in poorer countries? would we see a majority of civilians lose leverage (their labour) over the small % of people that own these technologies?"

14737,14764,0,"listen, i may disagree with your political views on a lot of levels, but what's going on right now isn't necessarily a bad thing for the country. the status quo needs to be disrupted and that's exactly what's happening and imo why so many liberals are going nuts, though i wouldn't call them snowflakes nor should trump supporters hate them as they are your brethren at the end of the day. with that said, i want you to understand that republicans are not the majority in the us, by a large margin. you need to understand and accept this so you can add that fact to your play book, as folks like the koch brothers have. republicans will need to play the long game in order to succeed, and the only issue i see with trump is that it's riling up liberals in such a way that any gains made right now might be too short sighted. i say this with hope you will continue to fight and stand by your convictions as a republican because the country needs people like you in it and always will."

15346,15374,0,"that's a half measure and is still very vulnerable to attack.  here's my $0.02(also public ledger implementation, but cuts out the risk of 51% attacks by requiring three factor authentication:  first thing that needs to happen is a federally uniform voter id, with a specific algorithm for id numbers.  in israel, our national ids(the id number is also printed in passports and driver licenses) are 9 digits long:  the first digit shows whether someone is an immigrant(3) or was born in israel(2).  digits 2 through 8 are generated according to whatever algorithm.  digit 9 is a check sum, meaning that if you sum the digits of all 8 previous digits, then sum them up until you are left with 1 digit, it will equal the 9th digit.  so the federal government would have a list of id numbers that are currently active, but not who it belongs to.after the above is complete, create a blockchain ledger that does some fuckery on that number to create a 64 character hash.  the 64 character hash will only be created if the algorithm receives confirmation that the id is valid(meaning it is in the federal government), and doesn't already exist on the blockchain.  an id number is assigned at birth(will contain say... 1 digit for citizen(1= citizen, 2 = immigrant), a 2 digit code for state, 2 digit code for congressional district, 12 digits for the id number itself, and a checksum digit), or at naturalization(structure should be functionally identical), by assigned i mean the hospital reports a live birth, and a number is generated in the system to keep that voter spot.  on a state level, to get your voter card, you will need to do a fingerprint scan and enter your national id number.  behind the scenes, the blockchain confirms that this national id is real, active, and doesn't have an id active yet.  so the 64 character hash of your national id, along with a hash of your fingerprint are summed, hashed again, and that hash(not your finger print or the national id) is saved on an rfid chip inside the card.  when it's time to vote, you stick your card in the machine, scan your finger, and enter the id number.  if the hash of the id number and the fingerprint matches the hash that is saved on the id card, the vote is recorded on the blockchain using the national id hash, and you can verify it almost instantly by accessing an app.  thus, voting is anonimized and fully open sourced.  edit:  the state and district thing doesn't change as a person moves to a different state, but instead what happens is that when someone moves to a different state, they update their address, and are issued a new voter id for the new district they are in, and that id is automatically removed from the rolls in the birth state.  alternatively, the state and district numbers are not included in the hash and check sum, and with every move, the district and state id is updated.  actually, if it's not a part of the hash, it could be visible publicly, and then, you can vote in the district you are registered to vote in from any polling station in the us, or abroad, as long as you come to an embassy"

15477,15505,0,">when you call communists fascists it lets them off the hook for being dirty communists by subtly suggesting...that somehow fascism is worse than communismfinally someone that understands this. the commie media complex has so controlled the narrative post-world war ii that even people on the right fall into it by using 'fascist' as an insult to even outed communists - as though communist isn't a bad enough distinction by itself.i'll say it outright, communists by and large have a far worse track record than fascists - and i'd take it further: they aren't any better than nazis. the nazi regime didn't even kill half the people stalin's regime did, and barely a fraction of the total deathtoll of communists worldwide - of course commies dismiss this as 'yes, but their intent was good! it wasn't based on hate!' really? the average nazi had good intent, too - go back and time and ask any nazi if his intent was 'based on hate' heck, even hitler had good intentions, they all do.another fallback argument is 'yes, but the nazi regime showed \*cue ominous music\* the 'dangers of racism' =\_=' - well, then, since their deathtoll was a fraction of the communists and their methods no less cruel, evidently the 'dangers of racism' are far less devastating than the dangers of radical communism."

15819,15847,0,what a crap take. anyone not voting because trump didn't fire sessions is a real mental midget.
15820,15848,0,"> republicans had the same reaction but in reverse. comey was seen as a hero for reopening the email inquiry on hilary shortly before the election. and when trump fired him they were mad and confused at first.only the ones not paying close attention.he overstepped in saying hillary ""had no intent to break the law"" (paraphrased) and implying that she shouldn't be prosecuted, all publicly.  he should have been fired that same day.intent for any regular federal employee or military member would only mitigate the level of punishment, not the prosecution for breaking the law.he could determine speculation as to intent, and should have included that in his report to doj, not played prosecutor and judge/jury.that kind of stunt was highly calculated to undermine lawful prosecution, knowing the government has a tendency to save face and issue a unified message.  in a just world, he'd be prosecuted as well.  as-is neither of them are likely to suffer any consequence, and that's less likely as time goes by.trump was 100% correct when he says this sort of shit has undermined the people's trust in these organizations, especially as mccabe also abused his position, plus all the leaks, conveniently deciding to end other investigations (eg vegas shooter), strozk and his woman, etc.i'm not even sure just putting in a great person at the head, doj and fbi chief, can get that back.  he'd have to do more than run it, he'd have to clean it the fuck out and whip them into action to demonstrate a renewed commitment to purpose.taking credit vicariously through local law enforcement and other offices for the sex abuse/trafficing busts isn't near enough to restore that lost trust.edit: that's not to say informed rep's weren't grateful that comey did do as much as he did.  same way we're grateful for pelosi, waters, and will be for alexandra ocasi no cortex.also: there's a time-line to consider.  hey may have been considered ""a hero"" early on eg right after starting the clinton investigation.  but for people paying attention, that should have changed as comey came out with what i noted above."

16380,16409,0,"there is no reasonable argument that can be made to say that the party switch changed the sides viewpoints on race. anyone who argues such is a fool. it really takes a fool to believe that the freeing of the slaves was because the north felt morally opposed to slavery and nothing else. the fact of the matter is that the north was arguably more racist than their southern counterparts. mistreatment of african americans by slaveholders was sparse. because they saw slaves as an investment. states without slavery did not see them as equals. far from it. the whole reason behind the civil war was that the north did not want slavery moving into the west and the south saw that as an attack on their livelihoods. but, the north's reasoning wasn't because they abhorred slavery. it was because they abhorred the people who were slaves. they refused to live in close proximity with african americans. at least, that was the case for the vast majority of the northern population. that's why tensions between white and black people increased dramatically after the civil war. southerners felt they had been robbed of their livelihood and northerners couldn't stand to be around them. that's what led to segregation and things like the jim crow laws. that's why you still see segregation in the north to this day. the north made it incredibly difficult for african americans to ever move into their neighborhoods. meanwhile, in the south you see far better dispersion of races throughout the community  you still see some small pockets of predominantly white or predominantly black communities but, they are typically smaller with less of a difference in crime and poverty levels.it really could be said that just like the main viewpoint of the republican party looking out for big business didn't change, the democrats views on african americans hasn't really change. the old democrats saw african americans as nothing other than a monetary expenditure they could use as a tool to accomplish their goals. that's still the case, but the ways they control those people have simply changed.

17561,17590,0,"while i can understand what you're trying to say, there's a point when on the carrot on a stick, the string will snap. expand too much, and the military will be spread too thin, which can lead to things like trade routes being compromised, people beginning to rebel as the country can't protect them properly, and then a whole downwards spiral.rome couldn't continue expanding forever, because internal problems are going to start popping up no matter what you do. the romans often had to deal with uprisings all through their expansion, which they had to deal with first, before they began to lose what they earned, either in territory or wealth. as they grew larger and larger, more and more uprisings started occurring, the corruption got worse, and romans lost their cause. there must be a fine balance between the two, i think. overcommitting aggressive behavior can leave you vulnerable to the threats lying inside. if you keep pushing the wall outwards without looking at what the people trapped inside are thinking, then you're going to have a problem eventually.

17750,17779,0,"the berlin wall stood as a harrowing barrier for nearly three decades, dividing east and west germans from their families and friends, and symbolizing the suffocating oppression of soviet-backed totalitarian regimes.  on world freedom day, we remember the struggle and sacrifice of those who braved severe hardships under communisms brutal reign, and we celebrate november 9, 1989, as the day when freedom-loving people on both sides of the wall came together to begin tearing down this hated obstruction to liberty.  we also honor the unwavering resolve of those who confronted the evils of corrupt despots and reaffirm our support for people around the world seeking to live in freedom and to enjoy the blessings of liberty.as of this year, germany has been reunified for longer than it was divided by the berlin wall, which imprisoned the people of east germany for more than 28 years.  while it stood, the berlin wall was both a physical barrier and a symbol of oppression.  few dared to dream of reunification.  the courageous and unwavering determination of those who dared to confront it and those who guarded it day and night, however, inspired millions to prove that freedom prevails over tyranny.  the fall of the berlin wall marked a major step in the disintegration of the iron curtain, paving the way to the liberation of eastern and central europe from the grip of communism and marking a decisive victory for freedom-loving people across europe.  many countries that lived under the shadow of communism emerged as new democracies and reclaimed their right to determine their own futures.  today, they continue to defend their cherished independence.unfortunately, we know freedom is repressed in too many places around the world, particularly where terrorism and extremism continue to pose grave threats.  americans have always held boldly and unapologetically to the truth that liberty is an inherent human right, and we reaffirm our commitment to keeping the light of freedom burning bright and shining out to the entire world.today, we pay tribute to the brave individuals who, despite all risks, have challenged injustice and fought for freedom, especially those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.  we stand in solidarity with those who still live under tyrannical governments and emphasize that the world will be better off when all governments respect the right of all people to live in freedom.now, therefore, i, donald j. trump, president of the united states of america, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the constitution and the laws of the united states, do hereby proclaim november 9, 2018, as world freedom day.  i call upon the people of the united states to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming our dedication to freedom and democracy.in witness whereof, i have hereunto set my hand thiseighth day of november, in the year of our lord two thousand eighteen, and of the independence of the united states of america the two hundred and forty-third. donald j. trump"

17817,17846,0,"whitaker is presently  only a very temporary stop gap , he will not be able to do anything of any consequence because he was not properly appointed and does not  qualify under the present laws to be appointed,he has not even been sworn in.this has been known for months by people who actually take a interest in politics not just believe everything they see on idiot book and will now soon become the focus of the left.if it was necessary to rush him in to keep a loyal eye on what is happening inside that is a bad sign, if he is there to make smooth transition for rosenstein leaving it is better ,but then shows how bad the long rumored  disloyalty within the dept is,there is really no other reason to sacrifice a loyal soldier this way as he will be attacked.lets be clear only people with no knowledge of politics did not see whitaker coming, he has been a major blip on the gop radar since he  was the co-chair of rick perry's 2012 presidential campaign.the president had sessions appoint him after he did a media sweep ""bird dogging"" (making his strong opinions known as a bargaining tool/threat).the president also made a point of  publicly singling him out for praise rather than sessions during his time under sessions and the president is well known months ago  to have had him on the short list for the white house counsel position such is the presidents admiration for his work.the president was urged again back when the rosenstein taping clusterfuck was exposed to use that to justifiably sack rosenstein ,using that as the premise to then legally qualify the appointment of  whitaker  which would then make the appointment legally binding under the laws.once again either the white house admin has fucked up or they chose to waste the opportunity of appointing him  the only proper way available to them (no way with his previous public stance the dems or rino's would confirm him)because rosenstein has flipped and needs to stay in position.sessions pre written and undated resignation letter (what is known as a top drawer poison pill, as that is where it is kept till needed in return for letting the subject fade away with no legal/investigation consequences, a common swamp and law enforcement  tactic) without rosenstein doing the same or being attacked at the same time imo comes down to 2 things, white house cluster fuck in dealing with a swamp critter or rosenstein has flipped which explains the change of language after the unusual air force one trip and abilty to blow off subpoenas with no consequence from the white house (remember sessions was allowed to do the same just days ago) ."

18449,18478,0,"you know, when the fake news complains president trump does not talk about the economy, they don't mention he talks about the#disgraceful way democrats and fake news media tried to destroy justice kavanaugh."

18463,18492,0,this is why you never donate to organizations that are not ironclad in their political stances. your money will be wasted on frivolous bullshit like this.
18464,18493,0,"americans are a dying breed, the [brain]dead are endless..."
18465,18494,0,pretty much what it was or should have been is a way to view math differently.  so for instance when trying to figure out what 11x22 you should first view the problem as 10x22 = 220 and then add the additional 22 to get 242.  pretty much breaking the problem apart in easy to do chunks.however the implementation of it is anything but simple

18485,18514,0,"it's not a big deal as in ""assault"", and the play is probably to make it seem that way and use the liberals own tatics against them.but from the whitehouse level they merely said that a reporter putting a hand on a woman doing her job is wrong.and there is where i think is the ""big deal"" enough to lose credentials.we all know the press game, where reports keep trying to ask questions and presidents moving on.  however, a reporter should never push away the arm of a woman trying to do her job to pass on the mic to the next reporter. that is what goes further than the normal press game and which i feel is enough to warrant him losing his credentials."
18486,18515,0,"yeah ive been called out for commenting here. i had inbox messages asking how much i paid for my account since it was 3 years old and had some karma and then being accused of being russian. you know, typical npc shit. "

18493,18522,0,i wasn't aware these even was a such a thing as a private fire fighting unit.
18494,18523,0,"the emasculation of the vic police force began when that nsw reject, the leftard  christine nixon became commissioner. whilst the people of her state were burning this cow was having a comfy diner with her good mates. couple this with the infestation of greens/socialists in local councils specifically in the inner city and subsequently in state politics, you've got a state whose populace is at the mercy of these civilisational vandals. none of them have to deal with the consequences of their batshit experiment, they're not the ones who live amongst the sudanese or muslims.it's easy to virtue signal from your homogeneously progressive shithole."

18496,18525,0,self-loathing.
18497,18526,0,his statement was a hell of a lot more enlightened and better framed than your juvenile diarrhea.
18498,18527,0,"i remember it clearly. it was the catalyst behind ben shapiro leaving breitbart and ultimately exposing himself for the neocon that he is. honestly, that was one of shapiro's stupidest moments.for the record, i like some of the things shapiro says and think he's undeniably a force for good in the world that the likes of cenk ogre or david pacman will never be. but shapiro's a neocon nonetheless, and his ideological framework doesn't exactly align with mine, nor with that of many of my fellow trump populists. but yeah, i'm glad lewandowski is still kicking it. and i'm glad that, as with kavanaugh, the truth prevailed and both men were vindicated from the duplicitous, vile, and baseless lies thrown at them by a hysterical mob and crooked media apparatus.
