0,1,"i really don ' t think she would win if she ran again .  if anything her running would energize the right all over again when that ' s the opposite of what you guys need ,  and she ' d further divide the left .  the right is too well versed on how to attack her and how to hit hard ,  it ' d be better to have a candidate whose fairly unknown and can ' t be smeared through the mud as much and turn off moderates or people who are wishy-washy about the whole thing .  historical precedence is not something to gamble four more years of trump against .  "
1,1,"i dont want to see that ,  and i wish dems would quit saying itdems are at a huge disadvantage financially against republicans .  if they dont take corporate money ,  they dont have a shot . we need laws to change .  best chance of that happening is getting a dem in office .  . "
2,1,"this is exactly what pains me .   the far right will hate any democratic candidate but there is an inordinate amount of lingering hate for hillary on the left .   i ' ll support whoever our candidate is ,  obviously ,  and would gladly vote for hillary again .   "
3,1,"this ,  exactly .  clearly there is an enormous segment of people who think she ' s just the devil in a pantsuit .  plus all the butthurt bernie bros  ( note: i mean just the crazies ,  not slandering everyone who supported him )  who *still* claim that bernie would have won the primaries if the dnc hadn ' t interfered . honestly ,  for her to even say this right now is in really bad form .  we need to begin to turn the tide on this government in the midterms ,  and anything that *anyone* on the left does to rile up the right is just fucking bad .  whether we get the ""blue tide"" next week or not ,  we will still need to focus as much attention on congress in 2020 as on the white house ,  so we need a candidate in 2020 that the entire left can get behind .  or at least as many of us as can ever be reasonable . "
4,1,"give me a break .  she literally lost to donald fucking trump .  i wish with all my heart i she would have won ,  but its not going to happen .  a large enough segment of the country hates her with every fiber of their being .  "
5,1,found the bernie bro .  .  . 
6,1,"because she has too much baggage and she ' d have the right frothing at the mouth to make sure that she doesn ' t win .  they would just *love* her to run so they can pull out their playbook again .  i also think there are things that they can hit her on that won ' t play well with people who would otherwise be sure votes - after metoo you can be sure that bill ' s history would be dragged up again ,  and she ' d be smeared for having supported him .  i ' d rather see a candidate that the right doesn ' t have reams of data on .  "
7,1,why does it have to be a woman ? 
8,1,why would you count michigan ? 
9,1,no it isn ' t .  she had her chance .  
10,1,"i agree ,  i guess i just fear that we ' re past the point of no return for warren too .  "
11,1,"unfortunately ,  hillary comes with a lot of baggage  .  .  . "
12,1,she won the popular vote by millions of votes and the only problem was complacency on the far left who thought she was a shoe in and they could protest vote rather than real vote . that won ' t happen next time . 
13,1,"what else are they going to attack her on ?  no one divided the left ,  and helped legitimize trump more than bernie .  the gop / trump hit machine will attack anyone that wins the nomination ,  and will use that to energize voters .  listen ,  i would like to see someone like kamala harris and chris murphy  ( or even beto )  win the primary ,  but im not going to tell hillary clinton to take a damn seat .  especially if bernie and biden run .  "
14,1,"beto just out raised cruz .  all small dollar donations .  i don ' t want politicians that are bought by corporations . i get your worry ,  but money has to be stripped out of politics .  it has to start somewhere ,  and our party is the one capable of making that change .  "
15,1,"how about you give me a break .  she literally won the popular vote by millions and since there ' s been many questions raised about russia ' s role in the electoral college outcome . if she runs again ,  it will happen .  a large enough segment of the country hates any powerful dem with every fibre of their being .  anyone winning that nomination for 2020 on the dem side will get the hate treatment and the  ' it ' s cool to hate them '  bot army against them on the internet . "
16,1,"baggage is what enemies make up out of thin air and put on anyone .   every candidate ""has to much baggage"" .   every ,  single ,  one .   this is a nonsense objection . "
17,1,"and won the popular vote every single time .   both presidential primaries and the presidential general .   and her popular vote lead gets bigger the second time every time  ( including her senate race  .  .  she won even bigger there the second time )  . you may not like her ,  but there are literally more of us who do .   its a democracy baby ! "
18,1,"whenever the hell did she say it was her turn ? that ' s how the far left demonized her ,  youre gonna pretend its something she actually said ,  youre a sexist and a liar . and bernie can go f*ck himself"
19,1,"man ,  then bernie is gonna have a *tough time*"
20,1,note that she said this after her campaign .  i think you hold a traditionalist view of what a president should be .  i personally think we need to view the role of the president differently but i can understand where youre coming from .  
21,1,"no ,  a huge part of the problem was also that a large number of people on the left *don ' t like her* .  i know that this isn ' t the most popular place to say that ,  but it ' s the truth and i ' m not going to deny it just because i like her .  combine that with the fact that she invigorates the right and i don ' t know why anyone who wants to win in 2020 would want her as a candidate .  "
22,1,"i worked for hillary in 2016 .  the problem wasn ' t just the far left ,  it was a lack of energy for her supporters as well .  i never had as hard of a time getting volunteers as i did for hillary ,  even her biggest supporters were so burnt out by the end of the elections that i couldn ' t squeeze more than one knocking shift out of them .   don ' t get me wrong ,  maybe she could ' ve won if the far left came in from the cold ,  but the fact is that many other candidates would ' ve won handily because of how they motivated their base .  this last election shouldn ' t have been an issue ,  democrats should ' ve won the presidency easily .  "
23,1,"all they need to do is drag up everything that they dragged up last time .  it worked ,  didn ' t it ?  it mystifies me that people would want to try something that has already failed once .  she deserved to win in 2016 but no ,  i don ' t think she ' s the best candidate for 2020 .  better to have a fresh face that people will be willing to flock to in comparison to trump .  "
24,1,"change it to  ' history '  ,  then .  the point is ,  she has a lot going on that the right can pull out to attack her on that still gets their base and more going ,  and i think that ' s a problem .  "
25,1,"agreed on both sides .  we had bush ,  clinton ,  bush ,  clinton  ( running and lost )  ,  obama  ( obviously beat clinton )  ,  then we had both clinton and bush running  ( both lost )  and ended up with trump .  america isn ' t huge on long term dynasties but the bush and clinton family sure did give it a run .  for 20 years we saw 1 of 2 names lead the country and then they still ran and personally i am glad both lost .  i ' d be happy if neither a bush or a clinton won another presidency .  "
26,1,"i ' m not advocating for her running again but your argument is the same regurgitated nonsense as always .  she lost pa despite campaigning there so heavily she may as well have been living there: pa was where the polls all had her comfortably leading throughout ,  she has roots there ,  the democratic convention was there ,  the had multiple big rallies including the final one with bruce springsteen ,  both obama ,  bill clinton ,  etc .  ditto florida for that matter .      in wi other democrats eg russ feingold who campaigned locally in wi lost by much more than she did .  with michigan ,  the state dems specifically asked her campaign to stay away ,  and wanted to run the game themselves despite mook trying to send money and resources .  of course mi was lost .    in all three states ,  there was enormous amounts of votes lost due to machines not ""working"" ,  voters removed from rolls ,  incredibly long lines  ( no early voting in pa )  .  she didn ' t not play the game - it was rigged against her .  "
27,1,"bernie is a fraud ,  nuff said . really dont feel like discussing him again on the hillary sub . "
28,1,"her staffers never said that her slogan was ""it ' s her turn . ""  unless you have a link proving otherwise ? "
29,1,"glad to see her still involved .   i also have appreciated her reminders for voter registration deadlines ,  etc . "
30,1,the death nail turning point was republicans desperate coward one term obama agenda .  
31,1,"calm down ,  i tried to watch it on my ipad and that ' s what it told me .  now i ' m on desktop and it ' s playing .  very strange ! "
32,1,"sorry !  !  can ' t be too careful on reddit ,  unfortunately - hope you understand ! "
33,1,alternative facts . 
34,1,how is that not like charles manson 
35,1,"i actually just read that the murderer was anti-trump .  he called him a tool of the jew .  which i wasnt expecting ,  because ,  lets face it ,  thats the first place your mind goes to when a minority community is targeted by a psychotic ,  pathetic loser with a  gun . this guy was just a full-on ,  hate-filled antisemite . "
36,1,"well this guy was avowedly anti-trump .  however ,  anyone can see that trump and other republicans are inciting this hate through their rhetoric ,  actions ,  and inactions .  the fact that the inciting reason for this shooting was an immediate fear of invasion from the refugee caravan lays the blame squarely at trumps doorstep .  yet within hours trump will be fear mongering about an invasion again if he hasnt already .  "
37,1,manson was much more intelligent than trump .  that ' s one difference .  
38,1,"he murdered because he actually believed the caravan heading for the us is funded by soros and that theyre about to invade the us . the whole hype about this caravan ,  the suggestion there are middle eastern terrorists in it ,  is spread by trump . those conspiracy theories which leads unstable people to murder are directly spread by trump /  foxnews . so it doesnt really matter whether or not this person is anti trump ,  the climate of hate and conspiracies is created by trump / fox . "
39,1,against the agenda that he thinks trump has  ( being a tool of the jews )  .  .  .  .  maybe but not anti-trumps actual agenda  ( white nationalism )  
40,1,where did you read that ? 
41,1,why the stickers on the van then ? 
42,1,what is your source on that ? 
43,1,ill give you that for sure 
44,1,billionaire trump isnt as smart as nazi charles manson .  your code is malfunctioning . 
45,1,wrong maniac .  the stickers-on-the-van guy was the mail bomber . 
46,1,billionaire trump .   ill believe it when i see some actual proof rather than the dreck that flows in chunks from his mouth . 
47,1,"ah ,  i meant where did he disavow trump .  i 100% believe he was full of multiple kinds of hate .  which makes it hard to believe that he disliked trump . "
48,1,"hm ,  i can ' t get back to an original source ,  but i appreciate you sharing what you saw . "
49,1,thats not denouncing trump .  
50,1,if you poke around a bit you can probably find the fb screenshots .  conservatives have been sharing them like wildfire thinking it completely vindicates the right .  
51,0,this is texas ' s fault .  they advertised in california for years .  
52,0,"""oh no ,  we ' ve fucked this place up ,  where would be a nice place to live ? "" "
53,0,"sf population is nearly a million .  61% of 46% of that is 280 , 000 people .  if 65% of these are liberals ,  that ' s a net export of 182000 libtards for texas .  conservatives better start having babies and instilling conservative values and guarding against libtard brainwashing .  "
54,0,"im from san jose ,  probably gonna move to texas"
55,0,"fuck that shit !  we should make a new law where when you move to a new state ,  youre not allowed to vote for at least 8 years ! "
56,0,no !  no !  no !  !  !  texas needs a law stating any new resident will pay the tax rate of where they came from to tx for 5 years . 
57,0,"they need to leave their california politics with them ,  they fuck up every state they move to .  "
58,0,"prepare for the ""refugee fallacy . "" they claim the want to escape something that ' s failed .  .  . then continue the same actions that led to its failure . "
59,0,"they will bring their politics though .  that ' s whats happening in new hampshire .  all the little massholes are moving to nh border towns ,  and voting blue .  .  . "
60,0,"quick ,  gregg .   make a law that says all incoming residents must own a gun . "
61,0,if there ever is another civil war in this country  ( god forbid i don ' t want or wish for one )  i would bet my left nut that it begins in texas
62,0,"no noooooooo ,  don ' t kalifornia my texas ! "
63,0,"it ' s literally an ideological virus .   it infects a host .   sometimes pretends to be something it isn ' t ,  sometimes hides in the shadows ,  sometimes overwhelms .   but it replicates in the host until it explodes .   then it spreads to healthy areas and repeats the process . "
64,0,"yeah ,  and there is literally nothing we can do about it .  "
65,0,fucking locusts 
66,0,"can california secede already ?  yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  youre the sixth largest economy blah blah blah  ( yet cant properly budget water ,  is perpetually on fire ,  and have people pooping in your streets )  . "
67,0,"we are having the same problem in florida with the influx of liberal puerto ricans who came after maria .  i don ' t blame them ,  they don ' t know any better because they have been brain washed by socialists .  we need more red pill dispensers .  conservative values classes should be mandatory in school .  the liberals already push their indoctrination anyway .  maybe the heritage foundation can come up with a curriculum .  "
68,0,"it ' s simply amazing to me that people who fuck up their states like california ,  oregon ,  illinois and others move to other areas and then continue ,  continue to vote for the same policies and have the same mentality that doomed their home state to begin with and it starts dooming the state they move to . it ' s a sickness of the mind .   "
69,0,"this is what happens when people are told that the problems and hardships in their lives are not of their own creation or responsibility . they are told that hardships and problems are created by their ideological enemies and that they are noble for spreading their forward ideas to these problematic parts of the country . san francisco isn ' t bad ,  it ' s the fault of the rest of the country .  once they bring progressivism to these backwoods hick towns then the problems and hardships will disappear . they are literally too stupid or zealous to realize that they ' ve ever done anything wrong or had a bad idea .  "
70,0,"the virus will spread to texas ,  and infect the entire region .   the usa will be a socialist / fascist country in less than 20 years . we had our chance with voter id .   now its only a matter of time . "
71,0,"if texas starts to turn blue because of cities and illegals ,  i have a feeling things will get very interesting down there .  the rest of texas isnt going to just take that lying down .   "
72,0,the democrat locus agenda in full effect .   texas should enact laws that you must live in the state for ten consecutive years before voting or running for any type of local or state office . 
73,0,"as a fed up ny state resident ,  i have plans of moving to tx ,  and so do many conservative new yorker ' s .  our governor says there is no place for conservative thought in ny anymore ,  we will keep tx red . "
74,0,the invasion started years ago .   california plates are a common sight in the major cities . 
75,0,when i see somebody in a car with california tags i tell him to stay the fuck out of my state they ' re not welcome here i don ' t care if they ' re red or blue or whatever just stay the fuck out you assholes ruined it now stay there and fuckin fix it
76,0,locusts .  
77,0,colorado and texas are the next californias .  this transition has been in progress for a while .  glad i got out of colorado when i did . 
78,0,texas needs to find a way to limit movement from cali .  .  . i dont want my texas turned into cali2 . 0
79,0,its like massholes who move to nh for the lower taxes and lower cost of living then start demanding all sorts of government services .  
80,0,can we just add onto the southern border wall ?  just wrap it around all the way please ok thanks ! 
81,0,leftists running away from their socialist policies they created themselves now taking them to tx
82,0,#s e c e d ethey are trying flood us out of our own home state .  fucking carpetbaggers ! 
83,0,this seems like the plot for a horror movie .  
84,0,a lot of things will change once the wall is finished and illegals start getting shipped out .  
85,0,is it possible many of them are republicans who are seeking conducive environment ?  
86,0,"yeah ,  let ' s leave one shithole and start another with the same bullshit policies .  fucking morons .  "
87,0,"need new law .  if you vote for policies ,  there ' s a 1% chance you are chosen to get deported to a country that is run using those policieslet ' s see how fast people start changing their tune when there are real and immediate repercussions for their decisions"
88,0,"i believe this is mostly bullshit .  people talk all the time about moving somewhere after an election ,  but most people dont .  still be on your guard ,  but it wouldnt surprise me if this just leftist posturing . edit: also lolpolling ,  as if polling has been accurate in the last few years .  im sure texas will remain the pedes . "
89,0,like a plague of locusts they leave destruction in their wake . 
90,0,"you know ,  those planning to move may also include conservatives who have given up on california wants to go to tx cause it suits their personal beliefs . "
91,0,"i ' m sure there are tons of conservatives in that mix .  i am a native san diegan ,  and although it ' s a military town ,  it ' s very liberal .  all the conservatives that i know are pretty quiet about it .  i ' ve been followed / harassed / flipped off on the road for having conservative stickers on my car ,  and had said stickers torn off my car .  now that sleazy newsom is in office ,  i see the state going downhill fast .  if i were to move ,  texas would be high on the list because of its *mostly* conservative reputation and less strict gun laws . while i would never want to live in san fran because i think it is a shithole city ,  it is where a lot of the great paying jobs are for people in the tech / digital industry .  that ' s attractive regardless of your political persuasions  ( i ' m in that industry .  )  i like to think that some of the people leaving sf are fed up with seeing a beautiful city go to crap under democratic rule ,  and they may be leaning more toward a moderate or conservative vote in the future .  "
92,0,"i believe a huge part of the problem is our banking system .   every american ends up in debt because of the fed - but they don ' t even feel it .  this creates perverse incentives to keep adding new social programs that liberals know we can never pay for - but they are very popular . even trump can ' t fix them - as a result we are hurtling towards disaster .  .   it ' s basically like maxing out all your credit cards and then getting new ones .  .  people like cortez want state paid healthcare ,  college and housing .  but its not really state paid - its debt paid .  "
93,0,headed our way ?  the first couple of waves are already here .  cruz v .  o ' rourke being empirical evidence of this . 
94,0,"most people moved to san francisco for a job and then found it to be too expensive ,  so they decide to move somewhere cheaper because the city has a lot of problems with housing and homelessness . theyre coming from all over the country and then going all over the country .  texas is a popular destination because its cheap and easier to raise a family ,  and if youre not making a fuckload of money you can still live very comfortably .  the comments here are really alarmist and over the top ,  but the reality is that rich land owners and shitty development laws made the place hard for average people to live .  they try ,  find that they cant afford it ,  and leave .  out of all the people ive met in sf ,  about 1 / 20 are actually from california"
95,0,theyre already here .  
96,0,"all i can hope for is that they can express their views in a non violent ,  constructive way .  i have no issues with other viewpoints ,  as long as the people giving it are respectful and have an explanation"
97,0,"hey guys ,  i had a sudden epiphany a few days ago while speaking with someone about technology stuff in texas .  this is **all intentional !  !  ! ** this invasion in texas is all about texas being #2 in tech .  this is a schmidt long game to wipe out silicon valley competition ! "
98,0,"time for some fact checking ,  boys . "
99,0,source of statistic ? 
100,0,"well ,  let ' s see ,  op .  .  .  there ' s rising standard of living ,  rising housing costs ,  and shifts in the technology sector of employment ,  with austin , tx being one of the top 3 cities in the u . s .  that are expanding so greatly in that . this has nothing to do with politics - this is business . you wanting to make this about ""leftists"" is abhorrent .  you ' re part of the problem . "
