0,0,1,"i voted for hillary in 2016 ,  and voted straight democratic today .  im listening to her book and playing video games .  i still feel so badly that somebody who was so qualified lost to someone who isnt .  "
1,1,1,"i can breathe .  barely ,  but i can . "
2,2,1,hey guys .  been a while .  i voted early so i won ' t be at the polls but i ' m rooting for us : )  
3,3,1,i think it is going to be a long time before election days don ' t give me 2016 flashbacks . 
4,4,1,whatever else happens at least kris kobach lost .  fucking hate that guy . 
5,6,1,"on tuesday ,  theres a chance for america to redeem itself ,  its been a long and difficult two years ,  but maybe we can find something to give us some hope in these midterms . "
6,9,1,today ' s the day .  gl to us all . 
7,10,1,democrats are on track to win back the house including picking up majority of clinton districts not to mention all the wins for minority and female candidates .  .  .  not bad at all . 
8,12,1,do you think we ' ll ever get some numbers on how much trump ' s campaign blitz is costing taxpayers ? 
9,14,1,"i think we lost most of the races the media really latched onto ,  and we didn ' t take the senate ,  but we did really fucking well when you start looking at the details .  obviously ,  we have the house and we can start to do more than tweet statements at the president .  and state by state we took a ton of power away from the gop . the amount of power the gop had  ( and still has )  at the state level is terrifying and we are starting to fix that in a big way .  "
10,15,1,"very mixed feelings about the outcome but very happy that so many women won . especially happy about sharice davids ,  lizzie fletcher ,  finkenauer ,  garcia ,  underwood and so on ! i hope no one can use the: let ' s run a guy cuz women cant win argument anymore . oh and good riddance to scott walker ,  rohrabacker /  putin and kobach !  ! "
11,16,1,also .  .  .  .  florida .  smh .  
12,17,1,"the first few times i heard a tv or radio head say ""governor-elect tony evers"" i felt like i had to pinch myself .  now it is starting to sink in and i am downright giddy every time he is interviewed or there is a story about his victory and plans . the asshole gop state assembly leader is saying he and his fellow grad ol '  partiers are going to move to put limits on gubenatorial powers before evers takes office .  what a mother-f\*cker .   all we ever heard from walker was ""elections have consequences"" but when the shoe is on the other foot ,  forget it .   i despise the wisconsin republican party deeply .   one thing for sure though ,  the state constitution guarantees veto power and no way they can take away that from evers and the democrats . "
13,18,1,"nancy pelosi interview on cnn on the top of the hour ,  cuomo prime time . "
14,20,1,great to see alexandria ocasio-cortez be the youngest women elected to congress !  i ' m looking forward to seeing her do great things and fight for progressive causes ! 
15,21,1,"one year ago today ,  i met hillary ! "
16,22,1,"my daughter still can barely discuss 2016 without choking up . i remember her telling me ,  the day after ,  how she and her husband broke the news to their boys ,  then 6 and 8 .  one of them ,  crying ,  said ,  ""but he ' s a bad man !  how can a bad man be president ?  ! "" indeed . "
17,24,1,the ptsd is real . 
18,25,1,i think it will be the rest of my life .  or at least until the republican party as we know it is ancient history . 
19,26,1,"if the results tonight are the same as 2016 ,  this country deserves anything and everything it gets .  i cannot imagine what more needs to be said and done to get people to vote .  if they don ' t want to vote ,  then fuck them .  let the gop fuck this country over ,  it ' s poetic justice at that point . "
20,28,1,and we got polis !  ! 
21,29,1,"i ' ve been carrying a 6 pack of new glaruss around with me waiting to celebrate .  don ' t live there but congrats ,  and the beer was good . "
22,32,1,"its pretty universal ,  even more well known people who never were very critical of bernie attack him now . what he said was also absolute nonsense: fl voted for obama twicehe ' s just pandering to white trump voters"
23,35,1,how sad .   / s
24,36,1,"now that he ' s lost the election ,  he can say it all he wants . "
25,37,1,what a scumbag !  boy byeeeee 
26,38,1,"karma ' s a bitch ,  ain ' t it jason ? "
27,39,1,love this .  .  .  .  . 
28,40,1,"""it was his job to be provocative on radio"" sure buddy ,  good locker room talk for your fucking radio listeners .  "
29,41,1,"tbh i ' m surprised this was enough for him to be defeated ,  considering some of the things others did who got elected"
30,42,1,too bad the shitbird needs a grand jury for that .  we don ' t indict people based on the whims of individual church-basement lawyers .  
31,43,1,"sadly ,  voter suppression and race-baiting seemed to work in florida and georgia .  .  . "
32,44,1,there needs to be a house select committee on voting rights and ballot access .  keep it in the news . 
33,45,1,yes
34,46,1,"i ' ve said before that the dems tend to be clustered ,  while the conservatives tend to be pretty scattered .   twelve million more votes were cast for dems in the senate races and the gop picked up seats .   let that sink in . "
35,47,1,again ?  [what the fuck is he doing here this time ? ] ( https: /  / i . imgur . com / mdhbut6 . jpg ) 
36,48,1,every  '  progressive '  bernie endorsed candidate in a contested area lost yesterday .  .  nuff said . 
37,49,1,there is nothing illegal about seeking asylum . 
38,50,1,"a few weeks ago they were a horde of invaders .  ""migrant caravan"" is several steps up and not technically inaccurate .  we don ' t even know whether they ' re all planning to seek asylum ,  or even get to our border to do so; right now they ' re just migrating ,  together ,  as though in a caravan .  i feel like we ' re going to have a hard time getting anyone to call them ""future bff ' s"" or something just because we ' d prefer to frame them as optimally as possible . "
39,51,1,"not one mention of the coup in honduras-- which is strange given the makeup of the ""caravan"" . "
40,53,1,"yeah pretty interesting that they point to reagan in the 80s and bill in the 90s but completely omit the specific crisis that led to this wave of refugees ,  the coup in honduras .  wonder why they wouldn ' t mention that our president and secretary of state backed that coup in 2009 .  "
41,54,1,theyve chosen to come to america which is their right  ( to seek asylum here )  
42,55,1,most of them do and will stop there .  
43,56,1,"that is not what asylum means .  .  .  . you can ' t seek ""economic refuge"" because you have no marketable skills .  .  . "
44,57,1,"thats a legal policy that eu member states have been allowed to institute since 2005 .  it is not ,  however ,  a law in the us . "
45,58,1,"thanks ,  i ' m aware of the apd .  being from the eu ,  i had to argue ""the first safe country"" with xenophobic right-wingers in europe all the time . what i meant is that in the absence of specific laws ,  a signatory country to international conventions and protocols must adhere to these .  i guess this must apply to the us as well . i hope this makes sense now . "
46,59,1,i guess hannity must have really good ratings .  $$$$ talks . 
47,60,1,just like all those people who are against abortion until their daughter has an unwanted pregnancy or are anti-lgbt until their kid comes out . 
48,61,1,no way . 
49,62,1,like all those now-former soybean farmers . 
50,63,1,"i often feel bad for the family members when things like this happen ,  unless they seem to be like the person who did these things .   they probably worry that it reflects badly on them and might feel a sense of betrayal as well . "
51,64,1,"furthermore .  .  . >  beierly rants about the collectively treachery of the girls in his high school .  beierly says at one point ,  there are whores in  not only every city ,  not only every town ,  but every village .  he argued that women who were in mixed-race relationships had betrayed their blood . >  i moved on her like a bitch .  but i couldnt get there .  and she was married .  then all of a sudden i see her ,  shes now got the big phony tits and everything .  shes totally changed her look . whatever your political affiliations ,  it seems to me only reasonable for the potus ,  the **first citizen** ,  the **princeps** ,  should be someone who tries to set a good example of how a person should behave . take mike pence .   i ' m a liberal ,  i cannot stand the mans policies .   however ,  after the #magabomber attacks he *immediately* came to the defense of the targeted victims .   he behaved with a degree of grace and dignity that made me respect him .   our retired potus 43 was ,  imo ,  a headache in office .   however ,  he behaved and *behaves* in a manner that inspires respect and emulation . our current potus is a toxic influence who inspires anti-semites ,  misogynists and racists to murderous and bloody action .   he **must** go ,  and swiftly ,  or ,  it seems to me ,  the u . s . a .  will descend into an even bloodier state of civil strife **that it is already in** . the gop has gone too far ,  and enough is enough . "
52,68,1,"because he has the full support of one  of the two major parties . you are right is it trumps words we are talking about ,  but the problem is much deeper at this point .  "
53,69,1,not difficult . 
54,71,1,"damn ,  glad to see you around here !  nice article ! "
55,72,1,"i ' m still nervous .   two years ago ,  we thought things could go well .   i don ' t think i ' ve had this much anxiety since the 2016 election . "
56,73,1,"thank you so very much .  first for your expertise in flying to which so many folks are forever indebted .  second for your understanding of the importance of protecting this great republic and to do what i hope and pray many will do as well .  historically we stand at a defining moment in our flight path we will either land on the hudson and all survive ,   or g-d forbid .  vermonters rock "
57,74,1,"lmao who cares about sully ,  he ' s just some pilot .  maybe a good one ,  but any pilot ever would try to land their plane when it crashed .  and the fact that he was a life long republican just makes it clear that he has spent most of his live voting to fuck over poor people ,  probably not a great guy .  not sure why anyone pays any attention to the man . "
58,75,1,yep .  the propaganda machine is running strong . 
59,76,1,"just got back from a weekend campaigning for his opponent ,  andy kim .  would be a huge victory in nj . "
60,77,1,"that ' s completely intentional .   destroy the institutions of american democracy from many angles ,  including by not having anyone to actually ensure it . "
61,78,1,its called obstructionism ! 
62,79,1,"they go low ,  kick em in the head"
63,80,1,">even though jerusalem is home to the three abrahamic religions ,  christianity ,  judaism and islam ,  christian fundamentalists seem determined to convert the entire region to christianity . >this view was supported by mark harris ,  a republican candidate for the house of representatives . "
64,81,1,"it ' s coming specifically from the contingent of people at charlottesville who trump labelled as ""very fine people"" . "
65,82,1,"unfortunately ,  it ' s coming from the racist faction in this country  whose flames have been fanned by the greasy human shitbag in the wh . "
66,83,1,this makes no sense . 
67,86,1,"honestly ,  do you think your post helps your cause ?  do you think this is or can be a major gotv issue ?  the other side has their caravan of fear motivating them ,  don ' t you think we need a more centralized coherent message ? "
68,87,1,"i was lucky that my college gave us excused absences if we had to miss class to vote and that my high school was closed on election day .    ( i didn ' t turn 18 until after i graduate ,  but that ' s still good for the kids who turned 18 before the elections .  )   "
69,88,1,everyone of those replies under her tweets was from a name######## account .  its so fucking obvious that theyre trolls .  and still posting fd up pics of pedophilia
70,89,1,those are some amazing women .   i ' ve read about several of them during this cycle and should learn more about the others . 
71,90,1,of course they do . 
72,91,1,>why can ' t the rest of those networks lick his balls like we donew fox news slogan
73,92,1,joseph goebbels would be proud of fox news . 
74,93,1,that is the definition of state tv . 
75,95,1,"actually ,  it ' s the definition of regime propaganda tv . "
76,97,1,a good way to celebrate journalists would be to elect people who don ' t consider them the enemy next week . 
77,98,1,">there is something else that mr .  trump does to facilitate violence against those he dislikes: he dehumanizes them .  these aren ' t people ,  he once said about undocumented immigrants suspected of gang ties .  these are animals . >research by dr .  cikara and others showsthatwhen one group feels threatened ,  it makes it much easier to think about people in another group as less than human and to have little empathy for them  two psychological conditions that are conducive to violence . >as dr .  fiskehas written ,  both science and history suggest that people will nurture and act on their prejudices in the worst ways when these people are put under stress ,  pressured by peers ,  or receive approval from authority figures to do so . >**so when someone like president trump dehumanizes his adversaries ,  he could be putting them beyond the reach of empathy ,  stripping them of moral protection and making it easier to harm them . **>if you still have any doubt about the power of political speech to foment physical violence ,  consider the classic experiment by the yale psychologist stanley milgram ,  who inthe early 1960sstudied thewillingness of a group of men to obey an authority figure . >subjects were told to administer electrical shocks to another participant ,  without knowing that the shocks were fake .  sixty-five percent of the subjects did what they were told and delivered the maximum shock ,  which if real could have been fatal .  the implication is that we can easily be influenced by authority to do terrible harm to others  just by receiving an order . >**now imagine what would happen if president trump actually issued a call to arms to his supporters .  scared ?  you should be . **"
78,99,1,that ' s one of the really scary ways in which trump really acts like hitler . if you ever wondered how in god ' s name people could murder 6 million fellow human beings: because the nazis spent years dehumanizing jewish people .  they werent thought of as people anymore but as vermin . if you dont understand the danger of foxnews stating the immigrants carry smallpox and other diseases: read up on what hitler said about the diseases jews carried .  .  . 
79,100,1,"i have a feeling that 50 or 100 years from now ,  the trump era is going to be talked about in history classes as one of the worst times in the history of this country . "
80,102,1,that ' s going to make for an awkward thanksgiving . 
81,103,1,"im really heartened by seeing a lot of family members denounce their candidate relations publicly this election cycle .  i think its awesome evidence that lots of people are more able to have empathy with all kinds of people ,  not just their blood kin .  overall it bods well for chipping away at racism and xenophobia .  "
82,104,1,"i ' ve always said that when your family can ' t stand by you ,  that shows that you ' re on the wrong side of things . "
83,105,1,brave children 
84,106,1,"its especially apparent in that video of him in a yamaca touching the western wall .  you can just see the *hatred* for his own daughter ,  stepson and grandchildren in his eyes .  "
85,108,1,why feel the need to lie
86,109,1,yeah there ' s no need to lie .  trump is an anti-semite .  definitely no need to lie . 
87,110,1,"thats my state .  its a vicious cycle .  im in the highest ranked college in west virginia and a local all my life .  im about to graduate and there is nothing here for me with my education and degree .  myself along with my classmates and people i graduated with move out so we actually have opportunities .  its incredibly unfortunate that its this way .  if west virginia has some staying power it would grow and prosper .  i might also add that im proud of my home state for not developing like the rest of the country .  economically its a disaster and dont think because im going to an expensive college that i grew up in the minority in west virginia .  my family was lucky to be considered upper lower class ,  my education is payed for with loans and scholarships .  the reason im proud is because this state is so wild !  its full of forests and wildlife .  no matter where you go you are best weld in between large trees and mountains full of beauty .  "
88,111,1,">  west virginia ranked poorest state in countryvoted 67 . 9% for potus 45 . >  experience keeps a dear school ,  but fools will learn in no other .  benjamin franklin"
89,112,1,"the state that gave trump his largest margin of victory ,  nonetheless . "
90,113,1,"those who live by the sword ,  die by the sword . "
91,114,1,i have never heard rachel ' s crew laugh that loud .  :d
92,115,1,i cannot wait for john oliver ' s take on this story ! 
93,116,1,the whole thing was bizaare . 
94,117,1,"""attack"" ?  we ' re pissing ourselves laughing here . i mean ,  here ' s someone genuinely so thick he *almost* deliberately got himself stomped flat by the fbi in order to .  .  . own the libs ? there ' s just nothing left to attack ,  he ' s taken care of every possible degree of humiliation himself .  only sheer joy left for us .  bless . "
95,118,1,attempting to accuse someone of sexual assault is a prank ?  hmm .  .  . 
96,119,1,its just a prank !  !  jesus guyys
97,120,1,what ' s really sad is that you screenshotted this very comment so you can go get high fives back at t_d .   
98,123,1,sure dont . 
99,125,1,she probably means knees . 
100,127,1,"palin is perhaps the saddest figure in the crypto-nazi republican party .   no longer the darling of the nazis ,  she has been utterly eclipsed by trump ,  a failed human being who allows his kamerads to feel superior to their leader ,  both morally and intellectually .   the bar has been set so low that even a meth-head can feel smart compared to 45 .   palin ' s a failed crypto-nazi .   tragic . "
101,128,1,"is she picturing a dodge minivan when she hears ""caravan"" ? "
102,130,1,"its pure anti-semitism ,  now we see how deeply its embedded in the gop .  . "
103,131,1,"since theyre walking .  .  .  and theres less than half left than what had started out .  .  .  . and its going to cost about $500 million .  .  . then we got genius ann coulter who thinks we should invade mexico over legal asylum seekers . republicans are retarded .  thats not meant as a slur ,  i have no other word to describe such delayed progress and attempts to hold back accomplishment . "
104,132,1,i often wonder how 08 might have played out had he picked .  .  . you know .  .  . not a half-witted nut job .  
105,133,1,agreed .  the moment she was made a mainstream political figure was the moment the tea partiers and like minded extremists got empowered and that ' s what we ' re seeing today . 
106,134,1,"people think the republican party was hijacked by racists and anti-semites .  the truth is most of the republican voters have always been these things ,  they finally have representatives that truly represent who they are .  moderates and independent voters need to step up and vote against the hate group .  "
107,135,1,agreed completely .  trump isnt the real problem: he is the logical result of years of racism and anti-semitism by mainstream republicans . 
108,136,1,"exactly ,  they used their code words on tv and in speeches but i ,  as a white man ,  was behind the curtain the whole time .  i was at the bar with the replubican voters ,  in the barber shop ,  at the park .  i heard everything ,  i knew who they really were .  the republican politicians that weren ' t racist and anti-semitic were willing to use the code words to win .  they had no idea the internet would empower the voters to shake loose of the pretenders and get true racists into office .  donald trump represents the republican voter that i have known my whole life .  he is truly what they have always been to me .  they finally have the representatives they ' ve always wanted .  this is who the republican voter has always been .  "
109,137,1,this should be the end for him . 
110,138,1,"being civil is recognizing the humanity of others .  we are fighting for civil rights while republicans are literally dismantling the civil right act .   ( i also agree with hillary ,  but the above is just another was of looking at it .  ) ""in recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings ,  we pay ourselves the highest tribute . "" - thurgood marshall "
111,139,1,"trump has made me forget how a leader is supposed to sound .  congrats us ,  you played yourself . "
112,140,1,i finally actually agree with her .  she is exactly right .  democrats need to stop being civil and point out that one side is virtually a hate group at this point .  it appears she has learned her lesson from the election after all .  
113,141,1,im so glad the lil lady has learned her lessons and is acting just the way you want her to now !  
114,142,1,"she made a joke ,  which not one poc finds offensive but racists are oh so upset"
115,143,1,"dykt the context of a joke matters ,  not only where and when it is said but also who is saying it and who they say it to and their background history and what they have done in their lives and what the people they ' re joking about previously feel about them and what the joke is actually about and who the actual target of the joke is and thus telling a joke is actually an exercise in social skillswhat i ' m saying is ,  if you can ' t tell the difference between an ""all black people look alike"" joke where the target of the joke is the person making the mistake ,  not black people themselves ,  then you ' re being purposefully obtuse or you lack social skills"
116,144,1,hillary clinton is like black folks watching a scary movie .  
117,145,1,someday i hope she flat out says that she called all this . 
118,149,1,"""crippling effects"" ?  since you ' re so full of imagination why don ' t you share what you imagine the crippling effects clinton would have had ?  or are you one of those deplorables who goes around echoing vague talking points you ' ve been fed ?  since you ' re posting on this sub ,  show the receipts otherwise you ' re kinda pathetic . "
119,150,1,"he unifies the hateful ,  the fearful ,  the racist . "
120,151,1,what a steaming pile of horseshit . 
121,152,1,til; muslims are body snatchers .  
122,153,1,fox has gone from faux news to fascist news . 
123,154,1,"i ' m listening to thom hartmann as i am reading this .   a caller into the show said he tried to record a hannity show on his dvr and got message that ""this receiver is not authorized to record this show"" .   this means you cannot document hannity ' s outrageous statements .   hartmann also mentioned that fox is free to most users ,  but msnbc is considered a premium channel which costs more .   he discussed structural reasons that make fox  more accessible to people .   yes ,  i would boycott their advertisers . "
124,157,1,yes !  !  !  absolutely !  !  ! 
125,158,1,yea i agree
126,159,1,it should
127,160,1,the fuck ?  youre welcome to leave the country
128,162,1,"i voted for her without reservations ,  defended her throughout and in the aftermath .   i honestly just don ' t want to see her go through this again .   i ' ve got a bernie bro acquaintance who ,  to this day ,  will still waste more breath talking shit about hillary -- and defending trump / trump supporters .   there are people who will refuse to budge .   it ' s going to be a crowded field of candidates as it is .   i love her but i hope she doesn ' t go through this again . "
129,163,1,the only one that can call trump putins puppet to his face .  shes the only one that can take him on 
130,164,1,"imo ,  hillary can do whatever the fuck she wants .  no one in the media is telling bernie ,  biden ,  romney and / or kerry not to run ,  but everyone is telling hillary to take a seat and keep quiet .  she got the 2nd most votes in the history of our country ,  and the presidency was stolen from her ,  so if she wants to take another shot ,  good for her .  let the voters decide if they want to nominate her again ,  and not a bunch of pundits on tv .  "
131,165,1,"i wish like hell she ' d become president in 2016 .  i don ' t see that she ' d be a viable candidate in 2020 .  love ya hill ,  but it ' s time for new blood . "
132,166,1,i believe she is the best person for the job .  
133,168,1,she can do what ever the hell she wants .   she has earned it .   
134,169,1,"with merkel exiting the stage ,  clinton in 2020 would be .  .  .  too good to be true . "
135,170,1,i can ' t even allow myself to get my hopes up .  she is truly the only fully qualified person for the job . why would she put herself through that again . 
136,171,1,"eh ,  i think it ' s a smart move .  if events unfold such that she is the best bet to get a democrat in office in 2020 she should run .  i don ' t think that scenario is that likely ,  but she may as well leave the door slightly ajar . "
137,172,1,run hillary run ! 
138,173,1,"love her ,  but i really hope not .  they need to find a candidate that energizes the left .  "
139,174,1,still with her !  always with her .  it ' s time for a woman to lead .  
140,177,1,"i never bought into the anti-hillary propaganda that portrayed her like the devil incarnate .  she was robbed of the presidency ,  but outright cheating ,  but her time has come and gone .  "
141,179,1,"no ,  thanks .  "
142,180,1,"i love hillary ,  but i think she needs to go away .  too divisive ,  unfortunately .   ( not because she is actually divisive herself ,  but between bernie fanatics ,  republicans ,  and russian trolls ,  plus a huge fraction of the american electorate is *really* stupid .  ) i actually feel the same about warrentheyve been working to smear her for years . and bernie ,  though im not much of a fan of his . i would vote for any of them in a general election ,  but id rather see harris or duckworth or someone else who the republican party hasnt yet demonized . and i think there should be plenty of good candidates ,  but now is not the time to worry about it .  we need to push as hard as we can with the midterms and start worrying about 2020 next year . "
143,181,1,maybe someone should remind her she lost to an umpa-loompa . 
144,182,1,"i hope she does ,  because the prize is worth it .  not just for herself ,  but for the nation and for history .  the us is at a fragile turning point ,  probably the most momentous for it since the civil war ,  and we need a dem to win in 2020 for our future .  i fully believe clinton is the best candidate to win .

145,183,1,"there is no other human being on the planet who can do the job as well as she can .   she ' s got heart ,  grit ,  and brains .   if she is willing to sacrifice her golden years for us we will be lucky to have her . "
146,184,1,"thank you ,  and exactly .  people don ' t realise there is a lot of historical precedence for this .  -andrew jackson won the 1824 popular vote but lost the election ,  then came back and won four years later in 1828 . -grover cleveland won the 1888 popular vote but lost the election ,  then came back and won four years later in 1892 . -richard nixon barely lost the presidential election of 1960 ,  then decided to run for president again and won in 1968 . so not only is there precedence for a candidate who won the popular vote running again and winning ,  but there ' s also precedence for someone who already ran for president and lost running again and winning . and in fact ,  *every* person who won the popular vote for president and lost the election who then ran again *all* won the next time .  of presidential candidates who won the popular vote but weren ' t elected president ,  there are only those who won on their next run  ( jackson ,  cleveland )  and those who just didn ' t run again  ( samuel tilden ,  al gore )  who nevertheless would ' ve had strong cases if they ' d wanted to run again . "
147,185,1,"i ' d like to see the democratic party rally behind politicians who don ' t accept pac money and corporate income .  that ' s the simple reason why i want her to not run again .  that said ,  if she runs again and is again the best candidate ,  then i will vote for her again .  i get the frustration ,  since progressives want the current politicians to shift further left ,  but i agree that no one should tell her not to run .  "
148,186,1,"i ' m just tired of clinton derangement syndrome ,  i ' d love like hell for her to be president but i ' m not sure i could handle that media environment *again* . "
149,187,1,"i disagree .  i think she ' s the most viable candidate .  i know that ' s not the popular opinion but if you think it through it is .  she has already gone through an election against trump and had *everything* thrown at her possible .  they have nothing left to throw at her but rehash .  and we know she ' s strong enough to take it and strong enough to weather republicans hating her and russia doing everything it can to take her down including trying to craft a narrative that everyone hates her ,  despite the fact she won more votes than donald trump and the second-most votes in u . s .  history . what people aren ' t realising is that russia and the gop hate machine won ' t go away if hillary doesn ' t run again .  they are priming for anyone who wins the dem nomination .  biden ,  harris ,  duckworth ,  booker ,  sanders ,  whomever ,  once they ' re the dem nominee they will be just as hated and just as maligned online by an army of bots making it seem real and cool to hate them and the gop will make them the devil incarnate like they did hillary . this gop hate machine didn ' t even start with clinton .  it started with obama ,  they made him the devil incarnate for the conservative base .  but obama was lucky that russia didn ' t deploy all their evil plans to give the presidency to his opponent and now we are dealing with not only a deranged gop but a hostile foreign interference to tilt our elections . personally i feel clinton is the one most ready to go up against this army and win for 2020 . "
150,188,1,"agreed ,  it seems pretty obvious she ' s joking !  she ' s saying she doesn ' t want to run again ,  but wishes and / or feels she *should* be president right now .  and she ' s not wrong ! "
151,189,1,found the trump supporter . 
152,190,1,"i ' m the left and she energizes me . all we need is for the misogynists on the left to sit down ,  shut up ,  and stop calling everyone energized by her ""vagina voters"" and other slurs . and this time we will make them shut up .   no hiding in secret facebook groups this time .   loud ,  proud ,  public .   "
153,191,1,"why ? the left refuses to even give warren ,  let alone harris a chance .  . "
154,193,1,"gillibrand would probably pose similar issues as hillary with her being unable to really motivate the liberal wing of the party because of her back and forth between conservative and liberal during the early part of her career ,  harris would probably be the better choice in my opinion .  but i ' m no expert here so i could be wrong . "
155,195,1,"third time ' s the charm ,  baby . "
156,196,1,"> i actually feel the same about warrentheyve been working to smear her for years . expect to see this with any female politician who is getting presidential candidate buzz .  i think were past those point of no return with hillary  ( sadly )  ,  but its important to fight the smear tactics rather than give into them .  "
157,197,1,it ' s not really losing when your opponent stole the election .  
158,198,1,"did she ?   we know she won millions more votes ,  but we don ' t know if the results in places like michigan ,  georgia ,  pennsylvania ,  and wisconsin are legitimate .   "
159,200,1,"i really don ' t think she would win if she ran again .  if anything her running would energize the right all over again when that ' s the opposite of what you guys need ,  and she ' d further divide the left .  the right is too well versed on how to attack her and how to hit hard ,  it ' d be better to have a candidate whose fairly unknown and can ' t be smeared through the mud as much and turn off moderates or people who are wishy-washy about the whole thing .  historical precedence is not something to gamble four more years of trump against .  "
160,0,1,"i really don ' t think she would win if she ran again .  if anything her running would energize the right all over again when that ' s the opposite of what you guys need ,  and she ' d further divide the left .  the right is too well versed on how to attack her and how to hit hard ,  it ' d be better to have a candidate whose fairly unknown and can ' t be smeared through the mud as much and turn off moderates or people who are wishy-washy about the whole thing .  historical precedence is not something to gamble four more years of trump against .  "
161,1,1,"i dont want to see that ,  and i wish dems would quit saying itdems are at a huge disadvantage financially against republicans .  if they dont take corporate money ,  they dont have a shot . we need laws to change .  best chance of that happening is getting a dem in office .  . "
162,2,1,"this is exactly what pains me .   the far right will hate any democratic candidate but there is an inordinate amount of lingering hate for hillary on the left .   i ' ll support whoever our candidate is ,  obviously ,  and would gladly vote for hillary again .   "
163,3,1,"this ,  exactly .  clearly there is an enormous segment of people who think she ' s just the devil in a pantsuit .  plus all the butthurt bernie bros  ( note: i mean just the crazies ,  not slandering everyone who supported him )  who *still* claim that bernie would have won the primaries if the dnc hadn ' t interfered . honestly ,  for her to even say this right now is in really bad form .  we need to begin to turn the tide on this government in the midterms ,  and anything that *anyone* on the left does to rile up the right is just fucking bad .  whether we get the ""blue tide"" next week or not ,  we will still need to focus as much attention on congress in 2020 as on the white house ,  so we need a candidate in 2020 that the entire left can get behind .  or at least as many of us as can ever be reasonable . "
164,4,1,"give me a break .  she literally lost to donald fucking trump .  i wish with all my heart i she would have won ,  but its not going to happen .  a large enough segment of the country hates her with every fiber of their being .  "
165,6,1,"because she has too much baggage and she ' d have the right frothing at the mouth to make sure that she doesn ' t win .  they would just *love* her to run so they can pull out their playbook again .  i also think there are things that they can hit her on that won ' t play well with people who would otherwise be sure votes - after metoo you can be sure that bill ' s history would be dragged up again ,  and she ' d be smeared for having supported him .  i ' d rather see a candidate that the right doesn ' t have reams of data on .  "
166,9,1,no it isn ' t .  she had her chance .  
167,10,1,"i agree ,  i guess i just fear that we ' re past the point of no return for warren too .  "
168,12,1,she won the popular vote by millions of votes and the only problem was complacency on the far left who thought she was a shoe in and they could protest vote rather than real vote . that won ' t happen next time . 
169,14,1,"beto just out raised cruz .  all small dollar donations .  i don ' t want politicians that are bought by corporations . i get your worry ,  but money has to be stripped out of politics .  it has to start somewhere ,  and our party is the one capable of making that change .  "
170,15,1,"how about you give me a break .  she literally won the popular vote by millions and since there ' s been many questions raised about russia ' s role in the electoral college outcome . if she runs again ,  it will happen .  a large enough segment of the country hates any powerful dem with every fibre of their being .  anyone winning that nomination for 2020 on the dem side will get the hate treatment and the  ' it ' s cool to hate them '  bot army against them on the internet . "
171,16,1,"baggage is what enemies make up out of thin air and put on anyone .   every candidate ""has to much baggage"" .   every ,  single ,  one .   this is a nonsense objection . "
172,17,1,"and won the popular vote every single time .   both presidential primaries and the presidential general .   and her popular vote lead gets bigger the second time every time  ( including her senate race  .  .  she won even bigger there the second time )  . you may not like her ,  but there are literally more of us who do .   its a democracy baby ! "
173,18,1,"whenever the hell did she say it was her turn ? that ' s how the far left demonized her ,  youre gonna pretend its something she actually said ,  youre a sexist and a liar . and bernie can go f*ck himself"
174,20,1,note that she said this after her campaign .  i think you hold a traditionalist view of what a president should be .  i personally think we need to view the role of the president differently but i can understand where youre coming from .  
175,21,1,"no ,  a huge part of the problem was also that a large number of people on the left *don ' t like her* .  i know that this isn ' t the most popular place to say that ,  but it ' s the truth and i ' m not going to deny it just because i like her .  combine that with the fact that she invigorates the right and i don ' t know why anyone who wants to win in 2020 would want her as a candidate .  "
176,22,1,"i worked for hillary in 2016 .  the problem wasn ' t just the far left ,  it was a lack of energy for her supporters as well .  i never had as hard of a time getting volunteers as i did for hillary ,  even her biggest supporters were so burnt out by the end of the elections that i couldn ' t squeeze more than one knocking shift out of them .   don ' t get me wrong ,  maybe she could ' ve won if the far left came in from the cold ,  but the fact is that many other candidates would ' ve won handily because of how they motivated their base .  this last election shouldn ' t have been an issue ,  democrats should ' ve won the presidency easily .  "
177,24,1,"change it to  ' history '  ,  then .  the point is ,  she has a lot going on that the right can pull out to attack her on that still gets their base and more going ,  and i think that ' s a problem .  "
178,25,1,"agreed on both sides .  we had bush ,  clinton ,  bush ,  clinton  ( running and lost )  ,  obama  ( obviously beat clinton )  ,  then we had both clinton and bush running  ( both lost )  and ended up with trump .  america isn ' t huge on long term dynasties but the bush and clinton family sure did give it a run .  for 20 years we saw 1 of 2 names lead the country and then they still ran and personally i am glad both lost .  i ' d be happy if neither a bush or a clinton won another presidency .  "
179,26,1,"i ' m not advocating for her running again but your argument is the same regurgitated nonsense as always .  she lost pa despite campaigning there so heavily she may as well have been living there: pa was where the polls all had her comfortably leading throughout ,  she has roots there ,  the democratic convention was there ,  the had multiple big rallies including the final one with bruce springsteen ,  both obama ,  bill clinton ,  etc .  ditto florida for that matter .      in wi other democrats eg russ feingold who campaigned locally in wi lost by much more than she did .  with michigan ,  the state dems specifically asked her campaign to stay away ,  and wanted to run the game themselves despite mook trying to send money and resources .  of course mi was lost .    in all three states ,  there was enormous amounts of votes lost due to machines not ""working"" ,  voters removed from rolls ,  incredibly long lines  ( no early voting in pa )  .  she didn ' t not play the game - it was rigged against her .  "
180,28,1,"her staffers never said that her slogan was ""it ' s her turn . ""  unless you have a link proving otherwise ? "
181,29,1,"glad to see her still involved .   i also have appreciated her reminders for voter registration deadlines ,  etc . "
182,32,1,"sorry !  !  can ' t be too careful on reddit ,  unfortunately - hope you understand ! "
183,35,1,"i actually just read that the murderer was anti-trump .  he called him a tool of the jew .  which i wasnt expecting ,  because ,  lets face it ,  thats the first place your mind goes to when a minority community is targeted by a psychotic ,  pathetic loser with a  gun . this guy was just a full-on ,  hate-filled antisemite . "
184,36,1,"well this guy was avowedly anti-trump .  however ,  anyone can see that trump and other republicans are inciting this hate through their rhetoric ,  actions ,  and inactions .  the fact that the inciting reason for this shooting was an immediate fear of invasion from the refugee caravan lays the blame squarely at trumps doorstep .  yet within hours trump will be fear mongering about an invasion again if he hasnt already .  "
185,37,1,manson was much more intelligent than trump .  that ' s one difference .  
186,38,1,"he murdered because he actually believed the caravan heading for the us is funded by soros and that theyre about to invade the us . the whole hype about this caravan ,  the suggestion there are middle eastern terrorists in it ,  is spread by trump . those conspiracy theories which leads unstable people to murder are directly spread by trump /  foxnews . so it doesnt really matter whether or not this person is anti trump ,  the climate of hate and conspiracies is created by trump / fox . "
187,39,1,against the agenda that he thinks trump has  ( being a tool of the jews )  .  .  .  .  maybe but not anti-trumps actual agenda  ( white nationalism )

195,47,1,"ah ,  i meant where did he disavow trump .  i 100% believe he was full of multiple kinds of hate .  which makes it hard to believe that he disliked trump . "

"
392,92,0,"i believe a huge part of the problem is our banking system .   every american ends up in debt because of the fed - but they don ' t even feel it .  this creates perverse incentives to keep adding new social programs that liberals know we can never pay for - but they are very popular . even trump can ' t fix them - as a result we are hurtling towards disaster .  .   it ' s basically like maxing out all your credit cards and then getting new ones .  .  people like cortez want state paid healthcare ,  college and housing .  but its not really state paid - its debt paid .
