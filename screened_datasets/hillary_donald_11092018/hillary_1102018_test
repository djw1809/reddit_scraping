"I really don't think she would win if she ran again. If anything her running would energize the right all over again when that's the opposite of what you guys need, and she'd further divide the left. The right is too well versed on how to attack her and how to hit hard, it'd be better to have a candidate whose fairly unknown and can't be smeared through the mud as much and turn off moderates or people who are wishy-washy about the whole thing. Historical precedence is not something to gamble four more years of Trump against. ",codeverity,e8ofkgr,hillaryclinton
"I don’t want to see that, and I wish Dems would quit saying it

Dems are at a huge disadvantage financially against Republicans. If they don’t take corporate money, they don’t have a shot.

We need laws to change. Best chance of that happening is getting a Dem in office..",mercfan3,e8olpon,hillaryclinton
"THIS is exactly what pains me.  The far right will hate any democratic candidate but there is an inordinate amount of lingering hate for Hillary on the left.  I'll support whoever our candidate is, obviously, and would gladly vote for Hillary again.  ",GethsemaKneejerk,e8ofc6o,hillaryclinton
"This, exactly. Clearly there is an enormous segment of people who think she's just the devil in a pantsuit. Plus all the butthurt Bernie Bros (note: I mean just the crazies, not slandering everyone who supported him) who *still* claim that Bernie would have won the Primaries if the DNC hadn't interfered.

Honestly, for her to even say this right now is in really bad form. We need to begin to turn the tide on this government in the Midterms, and anything that *anyone* on the Left does to rile up the Right is just fucking bad. Whether we get the ""blue tide"" next week or not, we will still need to focus as much attention on Congress in 2020 as on the White House, so we need a candidate in 2020 that the entire Left can get behind. Or at least as many of us as can ever be reasonable.",TheCheshireCody,e8o21l1,hillaryclinton
"Give me a break. She literally lost to Donald Fucking Trump. I wish with all my heart I she would have won, but it’s not going to happen. A large enough segment of the country hates her with every fiber of their being. ",That_Guy381,e8o99nh,hillaryclinton

"Because she has too much baggage and she'd have the right frothing at the mouth to make sure that she doesn't win. They would just *love* her to run so they can pull out their playbook again. I also think there are things that they can hit her on that won't play well with people who would otherwise be sure votes - after MeToo you can be sure that Bill's history would be dragged up again, and she'd be smeared for having supported him. I'd rather see a candidate that the right doesn't have reams of data on. ",codeverity,e8ofv9z,hillaryclinton

"She won the popular vote by millions of votes and the only problem was complacency on the far left who thought she was a shoe in and they could protest vote rather than real vote.

That won't happen next time.",Mrs_Frisby,e8oi62x,hillaryclinton
"What else are they going to attack her on? No one divided the Left, and helped legitimize Trump more than Bernie. The GOP/Trump hit machine will attack anyone that wins the nomination, and will use that to energize voters. Listen, I would like to see someone like Kamala Harris and Chris Murphy (or even Beto) win the primary, but I’m not going to tell Hillary Clinton to take a damn seat. ESPECIALLY if Bernie and Biden run. ",king-schultz,e8oxbbe,hillaryclinton
"Beto just out raised Cruz. All small dollar donations. 

I don't want politicians that are bought by corporations.

I get your worry, but money has to be stripped out of politics. It has to start somewhere, and our party is the one capable of making that change. ",OhLookANewAccount,e8olwck,hillaryclinton
"How about you give me a break. She literally won the popular vote by millions and since there's been many questions raised about Russia's role in the electoral college outcome.

If she runs again, it will happen. A large enough segment of the country hates any powerful Dem with every fibre of their being. Anyone winning that nomination for 2020 on the Dem side will get the hate treatment and the 'it's cool to hate them' bot army against them on the internet.",blitheobjective,e8oawu1,hillaryclinton
"Baggage is what enemies make up out of thin air and put on anyone.  

Every candidate ""has to much baggage"".  

Every, single, one.  This is a nonsense objection.",Mrs_Frisby,e8oil6h,hillaryclinton
"And won the popular vote every single time.  

Both presidential primaries and the presidential general.  And her popular vote lead gets bigger the second time every time (including her Senate race .. she won even bigger there the second time).

You may not like her, but there are literally more of us who do.  Its a democracy baby!",Mrs_Frisby,e8oit3n,hillaryclinton
"Whenever the hell did she say it was her turn?
That's how the far left demonized her, youre gonna pretend its something she actually said, youre a sexist and a liar.

And Bernie can go f*ck himself🙄",Danie2009,e8ofl2h,hillaryclinton
"Man, then Bernie is gonna have a *tough time*",FlyingChihuahua,e8p49ol,hillaryclinton
Note that she said this after her campaign. I think you hold a traditionalist view of what a president should be. I personally think we need to view the role of the president differently but I can understand where you’re coming from. ,hollidays24,e8pbxbq,hillaryclinton
"No, a huge part of the problem was also that a large number of people on the left *don't like her*. I know that this isn't the most popular place to say that, but it's the truth and I'm not going to deny it just because I like her. Combine that with the fact that she invigorates the right and I don't know why anyone who wants to win in 2020 would want her as a candidate. ",codeverity,e8oyy34,hillaryclinton
"I worked for Hillary in 2016. The problem wasn't just the far left, it was a lack of energy for her supporters as well. I never had as hard of a time getting volunteers as I did for Hillary, even her biggest supporters were so burnt out by the end of the elections that I couldn't squeeze more than one knocking shift out of them.  


Don't get me wrong, maybe she could've won if the far left came in from the cold, but the fact is that many other candidates would've won handily because of how they motivated their base. This last election shouldn't have been an issue, democrats should've won the presidency easily. ",I_am_ur_daddy,e8p0zj1,hillaryclinton
"All they need to do is drag up everything that they dragged up last time. It worked, didn't it? It mystifies me that people would want to try something that has already failed once. She deserved to win in 2016 but no, I don't think she's the best candidate for 2020. Better to have a fresh face that people will be willing to flock to in comparison to Trump. ",codeverity,e8oza0n,hillaryclinton
"Change it to 'history', then. The point is, she has a lot going on that the right can pull out to attack her on that still gets their base and more going, and I think that's a problem. ",codeverity,e8oizoh,hillaryclinton
"Agreed on both sides. We had Bush, Clinton, Bush, Clinton (running and lost), Obama (obviously beat Clinton), then we had both Clinton and Bush running (both lost) and ended up with Trump. America isn't huge on long term dynasties but the Bush and Clinton family sure did give it a run. For 20 years we saw 1 of 2 names lead the country and then they still ran and personally I am glad both lost. I'd be happy if neither a Bush or a Clinton won another Presidency. ",A1A5KA,e8p110c,hillaryclinton
"I'm not advocating for her running again but your argument is the same regurgitated nonsense as always. She lost PA despite campaigning there so heavily she may as well have been living there: PA was where the polls all had her comfortably leading throughout, she has roots there, the Democratic Convention was there, the had multiple big rallies including the final one with Bruce Springsteen, both Obama, Bill Clinton, etc. Ditto Florida for that matter. 
  
  
In WI other Democrats eg Russ Feingold who campaigned locally in WI lost by much more than she did. With Michigan, the state Dems specifically asked her campaign to stay away, and wanted to run the game themselves despite Mook trying to send money and resources. Of course MI was lost.
 
 
 
In all three states, there was enormous amounts of votes lost due to machines not ""working"", voters removed from rolls, incredibly long lines (no early voting in PA). She didn't not play the game - it was rigged against her. ",kantmarg,e8omk0b,hillaryclinton

"I actually just read that the murderer was anti-Trump. He called him a “tool of the Jew”. Which I wasn’t expecting, because, let’s face it, that’s the first place your mind goes to when a minority community is targeted by a psychotic, pathetic loser with a  gun.

This guy was just a full-on, hate-filled antisemite.",Corporation_tshirt,e8lnbl9,hillaryclinton
"Well this guy was avowedly anti-Trump. However, anyone can see that Trump and other Republicans are inciting this hate through their rhetoric, actions, and inactions. 

The fact that the inciting reason for this shooting was an immediate fear of “invasion” from the refugee caravan lays the blame squarely at Trump’s doorstep. Yet within hours Trump will be fear mongering about an “invasion” again if he hasn’t already. ",GlenCocoPuffs,e8lyjhy,hillaryclinton
Manson was much more intelligent than Trump. That's one difference. ,bigwhale,e8lxgll,hillaryclinton
"He murdered because he actually believed the caravan heading for the US is funded by Soros and that theyre about to invade the US.
The whole hype about this caravan, the suggestion there are middle eastern terrorists in it, is spread by trump.

Those conspiracy theories which leads unstable people to murder are directly spread by Trump/ FoxNews.

So it doesnt really matter whether or not this person is anti trump, the climate of hate and conspiracies is created by trump/Fox.",Danie2009,e8m0b6n,hillaryclinton
