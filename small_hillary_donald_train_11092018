1	i voted for hillary in 2016 ,  and voted straight democratic today .  im listening to her book and playing video games .  i still feel so badly that somebody who was so qualified lost to someone who isnt .  
1	i can breathe .  barely ,  but i can . 
1	hey guys .  been a while .  i voted early so i won ' t be at the polls but i ' m rooting for us : )  
1	i think it is going to be a long time before election days don ' t give me 2016 flashbacks . 
1	whatever else happens at least kris kobach lost .  fucking hate that guy . 
1	all-in-all ,  i ' ll take it .   we ' ve got some actual power for the first time in 2 years . 
1	on tuesday ,  theres a chance for america to redeem itself ,  its been a long and difficult two years ,  but maybe we can find something to give us some hope in these midterms . 
1	i ' m going to be honest ,  i ' m really nervous about the results tonight and i feel like it ' s going to be 2016 all over again .  i ' m just trying to stay optimistic ,  if worst comes to worst i have so much self-care activities planned tonight . 
1	regardless of how this night turns out ,  i ' m really impressed to see so many people vote this year . 
1	today ' s the day .  gl to us all . 
1	democrats are on track to win back the house including picking up majority of clinton districts not to mention all the wins for minority and female candidates .  .  .  not bad at all . 
1	oh wow ,  you guys started doing weekly roundtables !  yay !  will check this more often ! 
1	do you think we ' ll ever get some numbers on how much trump ' s campaign blitz is costing taxpayers ? 
1	been a while .  i voted .  early returns are looking as good as can be expected . 
1	i think we lost most of the races the media really latched onto ,  and we didn ' t take the senate ,  but we did really fucking well when you start looking at the details .  obviously ,  we have the house and we can start to do more than tweet statements at the president .  and state by state we took a ton of power away from the gop . the amount of power the gop had  ( and still has )  at the state level is terrifying and we are starting to fix that in a big way .  
1	very mixed feelings about the outcome but very happy that so many women won . especially happy about sharice davids ,  lizzie fletcher ,  finkenauer ,  garcia ,  underwood and so on ! i hope no one can use the: let ' s run a guy cuz women cant win argument anymore . oh and good riddance to scott walker ,  rohrabacker /  putin and kobach !  ! 
1	also .  .  .  .  florida .  smh .  
1	"the first few times i heard a tv or radio head say ""governor-elect tony evers"" i felt like i had to pinch myself .  now it is starting to sink in and i am downright giddy every time he is interviewed or there is a story about his victory and plans . the asshole gop state assembly leader is saying he and his fellow grad ol '  partiers are going to move to put limits on gubenatorial powers before evers takes office .  what a mother-f\*cker .   all we ever heard from walker was ""elections have consequences"" but when the shoe is on the other foot ,  forget it .   i despise the wisconsin republican party deeply .   one thing for sure though ,  the state constitution guarantees veto power and no way they can take away that from evers and the democrats . "
1	nancy pelosi interview on cnn on the top of the hour ,  cuomo prime time . 
1	just wanted to say i love you all ,  and that today was a good day . 
1	great to see alexandria ocasio-cortez be the youngest women elected to congress !  i ' m looking forward to seeing her do great things and fight for progressive causes ! 
1	one year ago today ,  i met hillary ! 
1	"my daughter still can barely discuss 2016 without choking up . i remember her telling me ,  the day after ,  how she and her husband broke the news to their boys ,  then 6 and 8 .  one of them ,  crying ,  said ,  ""but he ' s a bad man !  how can a bad man be president ?  ! "" indeed . "
1	to all the people protesting please stay safe
1	the ptsd is real . 
1	i think it will be the rest of my life .  or at least until the republican party as we know it is ancient history . 
1	if the results tonight are the same as 2016 ,  this country deserves anything and everything it gets .  i cannot imagine what more needs to be said and done to get people to vote .  if they don ' t want to vote ,  then fuck them .  let the gop fuck this country over ,  it ' s poetic justice at that point . 
1	lol .   that is the cure for any anxiety i was feeling here on election eve . 
1	and we got polis !  ! 
1	i ' ve been carrying a 6 pack of new glaruss around with me waiting to celebrate .  don ' t live there but congrats ,  and the beer was good . 
1	we lose senate seat after senate seat ,  does anyone ever say schumer has to go ? no lets attack the woman who made it possible we took back the house
1	that is good beer .  
1	its pretty universal ,  even more well known people who never were very critical of bernie attack him now . what he said was also absolute nonsense: fl voted for obama twicehe ' s just pandering to white trump voters
1	exactly !  and i ' d like to see these fresh reps who pledged not to vote for pelosi swim among the sharks . 
1	there needs to be a house select committee on voting rights and oversight has to watch the 2020 census setup like a hawk . 
1	how sad .   / s
1	now that he ' s lost the election ,  he can say it all he wants . 
1	what a scumbag !  boy byeeeee 
1	karma ' s a bitch ,  ain ' t it jason ? 
1	love this .  .  .  .  . 
1	"""it was his job to be provocative on radio"" sure buddy ,  good locker room talk for your fucking radio listeners .  "
1	tbh i ' m surprised this was enough for him to be defeated ,  considering some of the things others did who got elected
1	too bad the shitbird needs a grand jury for that .  we don ' t indict people based on the whims of individual church-basement lawyers .  
1	sadly ,  voter suppression and race-baiting seemed to work in florida and georgia .  .  . 
1	there needs to be a house select committee on voting rights and ballot access .  keep it in the news . 
1	yes
1	i ' ve said before that the dems tend to be clustered ,  while the conservatives tend to be pretty scattered .   twelve million more votes were cast for dems in the senate races and the gop picked up seats .   let that sink in . 
1	again ?  [what the fuck is he doing here this time ? ] ( https: /  / i . imgur . com / mdhbut6 . jpg ) 
1	every  '  progressive '  bernie endorsed candidate in a contested area lost yesterday .  .  nuff said . 
1	there is nothing illegal about seeking asylum . 
1	"a few weeks ago they were a horde of invaders .  ""migrant caravan"" is several steps up and not technically inaccurate .  we don ' t even know whether they ' re all planning to seek asylum ,  or even get to our border to do so; right now they ' re just migrating ,  together ,  as though in a caravan .  i feel like we ' re going to have a hard time getting anyone to call them ""future bff ' s"" or something just because we ' d prefer to frame them as optimally as possible . "
1	"not one mention of the coup in honduras-- which is strange given the makeup of the ""caravan"" . "
1	truth .  drug war .  gang organization .  corruption .  
1	yeah pretty interesting that they point to reagan in the 80s and bill in the 90s but completely omit the specific crisis that led to this wave of refugees ,  the coup in honduras .  wonder why they wouldn ' t mention that our president and secretary of state backed that coup in 2009 .  
1	theyve chosen to come to america which is their right  ( to seek asylum here )  
1	most of them do and will stop there .  
1	"that is not what asylum means .  .  .  . you can ' t seek ""economic refuge"" because you have no marketable skills .  .  . "
1	thats a legal policy that eu member states have been allowed to institute since 2005 .  it is not ,  however ,  a law in the us . 
1	"thanks ,  i ' m aware of the apd .  being from the eu ,  i had to argue ""the first safe country"" with xenophobic right-wingers in europe all the time . what i meant is that in the absence of specific laws ,  a signatory country to international conventions and protocols must adhere to these .  i guess this must apply to the us as well . i hope this makes sense now . "
1	i guess hannity must have really good ratings .  $$$$ talks . 
1	just like all those people who are against abortion until their daughter has an unwanted pregnancy or are anti-lgbt until their kid comes out . 
1	no way . 
1	like all those now-former soybean farmers . 
1	i often feel bad for the family members when things like this happen ,  unless they seem to be like the person who did these things .   they probably worry that it reflects badly on them and might feel a sense of betrayal as well . 
1	furthermore .  .  . >  beierly rants about the collectively treachery of the girls in his high school .  beierly says at one point ,  there are whores in  not only every city ,  not only every town ,  but every village .  he argued that women who were in mixed-race relationships had betrayed their blood . >  i moved on her like a bitch .  but i couldnt get there .  and she was married .  then all of a sudden i see her ,  shes now got the big phony tits and everything .  shes totally changed her look . whatever your political affiliations ,  it seems to me only reasonable for the potus ,  the **first citizen** ,  the **princeps** ,  should be someone who tries to set a good example of how a person should behave . take mike pence .   i ' m a liberal ,  i cannot stand the mans policies .   however ,  after the #magabomber attacks he *immediately* came to the defense of the targeted victims .   he behaved with a degree of grace and dignity that made me respect him .   our retired potus 43 was ,  imo ,  a headache in office .   however ,  he behaved and *behaves* in a manner that inspires respect and emulation . our current potus is a toxic influence who inspires anti-semites ,  misogynists and racists to murderous and bloody action .   he **must** go ,  and swiftly ,  or ,  it seems to me ,  the u . s . a .  will descend into an even bloodier state of civil strife **that it is already in** . the gop has gone too far ,  and enough is enough . 
1	politician ?   why not just name trump ? 
1	politicians like trump . 
1	pence thinks the only good jews love jesus ,  and may be wearing human skin for a mask .  but still a better human than trump .  
1	because he has the full support of one  of the two major parties . you are right is it trumps words we are talking about ,  but the problem is much deeper at this point .  
1	not difficult . 
1	are you sure im fine
1	damn ,  glad to see you around here !  nice article ! 
1	i ' m still nervous .   two years ago ,  we thought things could go well .   i don ' t think i ' ve had this much anxiety since the 2016 election . 
1	thank you so very much .  first for your expertise in flying to which so many folks are forever indebted .  second for your understanding of the importance of protecting this great republic and to do what i hope and pray many will do as well .  historically we stand at a defining moment in our flight path we will either land on the hudson and all survive ,   or g-d forbid .  vermonters rock 
1	lmao who cares about sully ,  he ' s just some pilot .  maybe a good one ,  but any pilot ever would try to land their plane when it crashed .  and the fact that he was a life long republican just makes it clear that he has spent most of his live voting to fuck over poor people ,  probably not a great guy .  not sure why anyone pays any attention to the man . 
1	yep .  the propaganda machine is running strong . 
1	just got back from a weekend campaigning for his opponent ,  andy kim .  would be a huge victory in nj . 
1	that ' s completely intentional .   destroy the institutions of american democracy from many angles ,  including by not having anyone to actually ensure it . 
1	its called obstructionism ! 
1	they go low ,  kick em in the head
1	>even though jerusalem is home to the three abrahamic religions ,  christianity ,  judaism and islam ,  christian fundamentalists seem determined to convert the entire region to christianity . >this view was supported by mark harris ,  a republican candidate for the house of representatives . 
1	"it ' s coming specifically from the contingent of people at charlottesville who trump labelled as ""very fine people"" . "
1	unfortunately ,  it ' s coming from the racist faction in this country  whose flames have been fanned by the greasy human shitbag in the wh . 
1	this makes no sense . 
1	i swear ,  she ' s one of the few public figures who actually cares . 
1	yeah cause that what she said right ?  i guess this humanitarian crisis shouldn ' t get any attention ,  right ? 
1	honestly ,  do you think your post helps your cause ?  do you think this is or can be a major gotv issue ?  the other side has their caravan of fear motivating them ,  don ' t you think we need a more centralized coherent message ? 
1	i was lucky that my college gave us excused absences if we had to miss class to vote and that my high school was closed on election day .    ( i didn ' t turn 18 until after i graduate ,  but that ' s still good for the kids who turned 18 before the elections .  )   
1	everyone of those replies under her tweets was from a name######## account .  its so fucking obvious that theyre trolls .  and still posting fd up pics of pedophilia
1	those are some amazing women .   i ' ve read about several of them during this cycle and should learn more about the others . 
1	of course they do . 
1	>why can ' t the rest of those networks lick his balls like we donew fox news slogan
1	joseph goebbels would be proud of fox news . 
1	that is the definition of state tv . 
1	"""in the end ,  everybody knew what had to be done . ""this was the last line in something i heard on npr a long time ago .  it was a woman who was a young adult in hitler ' s time ,  i don ' t remember the exact context .  it was the end of one of those progressive statements ,  like the one that begins ""first they came for the socialists .  .  . "" and ends with "" .  .  .  and then they came for me ,  and there was no one left to speak for me"" . she was talking about how at first they listened to every thing the fuehrer said ,  and then i don ' t remember the middle part ,  but the last line ""in the end ,  everybody knew what had to be done , "" has stuck with me .  in the end the fuehrer didn ' t need to speak ,  people did what they believed was his bidding because they knew ""what was in his heart"" . "
1	actually ,  it ' s the definition of regime propaganda tv . 
1	the link gives me a 404 error .  
1	a good way to celebrate journalists would be to elect people who don ' t consider them the enemy next week . 
1	>there is something else that mr .  trump does to facilitate violence against those he dislikes: he dehumanizes them .  these aren ' t people ,  he once said about undocumented immigrants suspected of gang ties .  these are animals . >research by dr .  cikara and others showsthatwhen one group feels threatened ,  it makes it much easier to think about people in another group as less than human and to have little empathy for them  two psychological conditions that are conducive to violence . >as dr .  fiskehas written ,  both science and history suggest that people will nurture and act on their prejudices in the worst ways when these people are put under stress ,  pressured by peers ,  or receive approval from authority figures to do so . >**so when someone like president trump dehumanizes his adversaries ,  he could be putting them beyond the reach of empathy ,  stripping them of moral protection and making it easier to harm them . **>if you still have any doubt about the power of political speech to foment physical violence ,  consider the classic experiment by the yale psychologist stanley milgram ,  who inthe early 1960sstudied thewillingness of a group of men to obey an authority figure . >subjects were told to administer electrical shocks to another participant ,  without knowing that the shocks were fake .  sixty-five percent of the subjects did what they were told and delivered the maximum shock ,  which if real could have been fatal .  the implication is that we can easily be influenced by authority to do terrible harm to others  just by receiving an order . >**now imagine what would happen if president trump actually issued a call to arms to his supporters .  scared ?  you should be . **
1	that ' s one of the really scary ways in which trump really acts like hitler . if you ever wondered how in god ' s name people could murder 6 million fellow human beings: because the nazis spent years dehumanizing jewish people .  they werent thought of as people anymore but as vermin . if you dont understand the danger of foxnews stating the immigrants carry smallpox and other diseases: read up on what hitler said about the diseases jews carried .  .  . 
1	i have a feeling that 50 or 100 years from now ,  the trump era is going to be talked about in history classes as one of the worst times in the history of this country . 
1	>trump is the enemy because he is a liar and a crook and a thug ,  and he sits in a position of the highest power . >the idea of american history as an uneven forward march toward greater democracy ,  despite occasional setbacks and errors ,  is flatly untrue . >immediately after the civil war ,  black men were granted suffrage and were able to hold office ,  in a multiracial democracy .  a successful campaign of terror ,  permitted by a compliant national government and supported by intellectuals ,  stripped the freed people of their rights and kept them in subjugation for most of the following century .  **the country went backwards ,  savagely and enthusiastically ,  and stayed there for generations . ** the fourteenth amendment was a set of words on paper ,  with no power to protect peoples rights or their lives against the racist laws and policies that had been put into effect .  **the results were so brutal and effective that by the 1930s ,  the nazis werestudying them as an   exaple of where a country might be able to go . **
1	that ' s going to make for an awkward thanksgiving . 
1	im really heartened by seeing a lot of family members denounce their candidate relations publicly this election cycle .  i think its awesome evidence that lots of people are more able to have empathy with all kinds of people ,  not just their blood kin .  overall it bods well for chipping away at racism and xenophobia .  
1	i ' ve always said that when your family can ' t stand by you ,  that shows that you ' re on the wrong side of things . 
1	brave children 
1	its especially apparent in that video of him in a yamaca touching the western wall .  you can just see the *hatred* for his own daughter ,  stepson and grandchildren in his eyes .  
1	how can anyone question that after this weekend ' s events ? 
1	why feel the need to lie
1	yeah there ' s no need to lie .  trump is an anti-semite .  definitely no need to lie . 
1	thats my state .  its a vicious cycle .  im in the highest ranked college in west virginia and a local all my life .  im about to graduate and there is nothing here for me with my education and degree .  myself along with my classmates and people i graduated with move out so we actually have opportunities .  its incredibly unfortunate that its this way .  if west virginia has some staying power it would grow and prosper .  i might also add that im proud of my home state for not developing like the rest of the country .  economically its a disaster and dont think because im going to an expensive college that i grew up in the minority in west virginia .  my family was lucky to be considered upper lower class ,  my education is payed for with loans and scholarships .  the reason im proud is because this state is so wild !  its full of forests and wildlife .  no matter where you go you are best weld in between large trees and mountains full of beauty .  
1	>  west virginia ranked poorest state in countryvoted 67 . 9% for potus 45 . >  experience keeps a dear school ,  but fools will learn in no other .  benjamin franklin
1	the state that gave trump his largest margin of victory ,  nonetheless . 
1	those who live by the sword ,  die by the sword . 
1	i have never heard rachel ' s crew laugh that loud .  :d
1	i cannot wait for john oliver ' s take on this story ! 
1	the whole thing was bizaare . 
1	"""attack"" ?  we ' re pissing ourselves laughing here . i mean ,  here ' s someone genuinely so thick he *almost* deliberately got himself stomped flat by the fbi in order to .  .  . own the libs ? there ' s just nothing left to attack ,  he ' s taken care of every possible degree of humiliation himself .  only sheer joy left for us .  bless . "
1	attempting to accuse someone of sexual assault is a prank ?  hmm .  .  . 
1	its just a prank !  !  jesus guyys
1	what ' s really sad is that you screenshotted this very comment so you can go get high fives back at t_d .   
1	you ' re so desperate you try to troll a mostly dead sub .  not a lot going on in your life ,  is there ?  maybe you should try canvassing . 
1	these peoples brains are broken .  
1	sure dont . 
1	a woman testified under oath putting her entire life on the line .  where is this evidence of fabrication you speak of ? 
1	she probably means knees . 
1	thats when the country went to hell: when mccain chose this dumbf*ck as his vp candidate
1	palin is perhaps the saddest figure in the crypto-nazi republican party .   no longer the darling of the nazis ,  she has been utterly eclipsed by trump ,  a failed human being who allows his kamerads to feel superior to their leader ,  both morally and intellectually .   the bar has been set so low that even a meth-head can feel smart compared to 45 .   palin ' s a failed crypto-nazi .   tragic . 
1	"is she picturing a dodge minivan when she hears ""caravan"" ? "
1	>i suspect they were funded by left-wing billionaires who are trying to make our fine president ,  donald trump ,  look incompetent . shes talkin about the dude who cant work an umbrella 
1	its pure anti-semitism ,  now we see how deeply its embedded in the gop .  . 
1	since theyre walking .  .  .  and theres less than half left than what had started out .  .  .  . and its going to cost about $500 million .  .  . then we got genius ann coulter who thinks we should invade mexico over legal asylum seekers . republicans are retarded .  thats not meant as a slur ,  i have no other word to describe such delayed progress and attempts to hold back accomplishment . 
1	i often wonder how 08 might have played out had he picked .  .  . you know .  .  . not a half-witted nut job .  
1	agreed .  the moment she was made a mainstream political figure was the moment the tea partiers and like minded extremists got empowered and that ' s what we ' re seeing today . 
1	people think the republican party was hijacked by racists and anti-semites .  the truth is most of the republican voters have always been these things ,  they finally have representatives that truly represent who they are .  moderates and independent voters need to step up and vote against the hate group .  
1	agreed completely .  trump isnt the real problem: he is the logical result of years of racism and anti-semitism by mainstream republicans . 
1	exactly ,  they used their code words on tv and in speeches but i ,  as a white man ,  was behind the curtain the whole time .  i was at the bar with the replubican voters ,  in the barber shop ,  at the park .  i heard everything ,  i knew who they really were .  the republican politicians that weren ' t racist and anti-semitic were willing to use the code words to win .  they had no idea the internet would empower the voters to shake loose of the pretenders and get true racists into office .  donald trump represents the republican voter that i have known my whole life .  he is truly what they have always been to me .  they finally have the representatives they ' ve always wanted .  this is who the republican voter has always been .  
1	this should be the end for him . 
1	"being civil is recognizing the humanity of others .  we are fighting for civil rights while republicans are literally dismantling the civil right act .   ( i also agree with hillary ,  but the above is just another was of looking at it .  ) ""in recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings ,  we pay ourselves the highest tribute . "" - thurgood marshall "
1	trump has made me forget how a leader is supposed to sound .  congrats us ,  you played yourself . 
1	i finally actually agree with her .  she is exactly right .  democrats need to stop being civil and point out that one side is virtually a hate group at this point .  it appears she has learned her lesson from the election after all .  
1	im so glad the lil lady has learned her lessons and is acting just the way you want her to now !  
1	she made a joke ,  which not one poc finds offensive but racists are oh so upset
1	"dykt the context of a joke matters ,  not only where and when it is said but also who is saying it and who they say it to and their background history and what they have done in their lives and what the people they ' re joking about previously feel about them and what the joke is actually about and who the actual target of the joke is and thus telling a joke is actually an exercise in social skillswhat i ' m saying is ,  if you can ' t tell the difference between an ""all black people look alike"" joke where the target of the joke is the person making the mistake ,  not black people themselves ,  then you ' re being purposefully obtuse or you lack social skills"
1	hillary clinton is like black folks watching a scary movie .  
1	someday i hope she flat out says that she called all this . 
1	we listened fine .  a lot of us just want to end things like birthright citizenship and common decency .   ( or we value tax cuts more .  ) 
1	it could ' ve been worse had trump not have been voted in .  imagine the crippling effects clinton would have had .  phew ,  we dodged a bullet there . 
1	i ' m a far leftist progressive but i fucking love hillary .  i ' m one progressive that like to say i ' m sorry for doubting you .  i voted for you and campaign for you but didn ' t put in my 100% and never spoke up for you when other progressives were trashing you .  we fucked up  .  .  .  . big time .  
1	"""crippling effects"" ?  since you ' re so full of imagination why don ' t you share what you imagine the crippling effects clinton would have had ?  or are you one of those deplorables who goes around echoing vague talking points you ' ve been fed ?  since you ' re posting on this sub ,  show the receipts otherwise you ' re kinda pathetic . "
1	he unifies the hateful ,  the fearful ,  the racist . 
1	what a steaming pile of horseshit . 
1	til; muslims are body snatchers .  
1	fox has gone from faux news to fascist news . 
1	"i ' m listening to thom hartmann as i am reading this .   a caller into the show said he tried to record a hannity show on his dvr and got message that ""this receiver is not authorized to record this show"" .   this means you cannot document hannity ' s outrageous statements .   hartmann also mentioned that fox is free to most users ,  but msnbc is considered a premium channel which costs more .   he discussed structural reasons that make fox  more accessible to people .   yes ,  i would boycott their advertisers . "
1	long past time ! 
1	i dont need medicare funded catheters anyways . 
1	yes !  !  !  absolutely !  !  ! 
1	yea i agree
1	it should
1	the fuck ?  youre welcome to leave the country
1	as soon as we revise the 2nd amendment too . 
1	i voted for her without reservations ,  defended her throughout and in the aftermath .   i honestly just don ' t want to see her go through this again .   i ' ve got a bernie bro acquaintance who ,  to this day ,  will still waste more breath talking shit about hillary -- and defending trump / trump supporters .   there are people who will refuse to budge .   it ' s going to be a crowded field of candidates as it is .   i love her but i hope she doesn ' t go through this again . 
1	the only one that can call trump putins puppet to his face .  shes the only one that can take him on 
1	imo ,  hillary can do whatever the fuck she wants .  no one in the media is telling bernie ,  biden ,  romney and / or kerry not to run ,  but everyone is telling hillary to take a seat and keep quiet .  she got the 2nd most votes in the history of our country ,  and the presidency was stolen from her ,  so if she wants to take another shot ,  good for her .  let the voters decide if they want to nominate her again ,  and not a bunch of pundits on tv .  
1	i wish like hell she ' d become president in 2016 .  i don ' t see that she ' d be a viable candidate in 2020 .  love ya hill ,  but it ' s time for new blood . 
1	i believe she is the best person for the job .  
1	"i think this is the media jumping the gun  a bit - listening to this interview it really doesn ' t sound to me like she ' s thinking of running - she said ""no"" pretty clearly .  to the question .   i think she ' s more saying she wishes she had become president  ( of course she does ,  as do i !  )  and believes she ' s qualified to be president  ( which she is )  .   she might be genuinely interested in another stint as secretary of state however ,  given her point about reminding the world ,  currently confused by trump ,  what america stands for . "
1	she can do what ever the hell she wants .   she has earned it .   
1	with merkel exiting the stage ,  clinton in 2020 would be .  .  .  too good to be true . 
1	i can ' t even allow myself to get my hopes up .  she is truly the only fully qualified person for the job . why would she put herself through that again . 
1	eh ,  i think it ' s a smart move .  if events unfold such that she is the best bet to get a democrat in office in 2020 she should run .  i don ' t think that scenario is that likely ,  but she may as well leave the door slightly ajar . 
1	run hillary run ! 
1	love her ,  but i really hope not .  they need to find a candidate that energizes the left .  
1	still with her !  always with her .  it ' s time for a woman to lead .  
1	i hope she runs again 
1	i love hillary ,  but maybe she should instead endorse a candidate like kamala harris or kirsten gillibrand 
1	i never bought into the anti-hillary propaganda that portrayed her like the devil incarnate .  she was robbed of the presidency ,  but outright cheating ,  but her time has come and gone .  
1	no .  she had two chances already and lost both times .  
1	no ,  thanks .  
1	i love hillary ,  but i think she needs to go away .  too divisive ,  unfortunately .   ( not because she is actually divisive herself ,  but between bernie fanatics ,  republicans ,  and russian trolls ,  plus a huge fraction of the american electorate is *really* stupid .  ) i actually feel the same about warrentheyve been working to smear her for years . and bernie ,  though im not much of a fan of his . i would vote for any of them in a general election ,  but id rather see harris or duckworth or someone else who the republican party hasnt yet demonized . and i think there should be plenty of good candidates ,  but now is not the time to worry about it .  we need to push as hard as we can with the midterms and start worrying about 2020 next year . 
1	maybe someone should remind her she lost to an umpa-loompa . 
1	i hope she does ,  because the prize is worth it .  not just for herself ,  but for the nation and for history .  the us is at a fragile turning point ,  probably the most momentous for it since the civil war ,  and we need a dem to win in 2020 for our future .  i fully believe clinton is the best candidate to win . 
1	there is no other human being on the planet who can do the job as well as she can .   she ' s got heart ,  grit ,  and brains .   if she is willing to sacrifice her golden years for us we will be lucky to have her . 
1	thank you ,  and exactly .  people don ' t realise there is a lot of historical precedence for this .  -andrew jackson won the 1824 popular vote but lost the election ,  then came back and won four years later in 1828 . -grover cleveland won the 1888 popular vote but lost the election ,  then came back and won four years later in 1892 . -richard nixon barely lost the presidential election of 1960 ,  then decided to run for president again and won in 1968 . so not only is there precedence for a candidate who won the popular vote running again and winning ,  but there ' s also precedence for someone who already ran for president and lost running again and winning . and in fact ,  *every* person who won the popular vote for president and lost the election who then ran again *all* won the next time .  of presidential candidates who won the popular vote but weren ' t elected president ,  there are only those who won on their next run  ( jackson ,  cleveland )  and those who just didn ' t run again  ( samuel tilden ,  al gore )  who nevertheless would ' ve had strong cases if they ' d wanted to run again . 
1	i ' d like to see the democratic party rally behind politicians who don ' t accept pac money and corporate income .  that ' s the simple reason why i want her to not run again .  that said ,  if she runs again and is again the best candidate ,  then i will vote for her again .  i get the frustration ,  since progressives want the current politicians to shift further left ,  but i agree that no one should tell her not to run .  
1	i ' m just tired of clinton derangement syndrome ,  i ' d love like hell for her to be president but i ' m not sure i could handle that media environment *again* . 
1	i disagree .  i think she ' s the most viable candidate .  i know that ' s not the popular opinion but if you think it through it is .  she has already gone through an election against trump and had *everything* thrown at her possible .  they have nothing left to throw at her but rehash .  and we know she ' s strong enough to take it and strong enough to weather republicans hating her and russia doing everything it can to take her down including trying to craft a narrative that everyone hates her ,  despite the fact she won more votes than donald trump and the second-most votes in u . s .  history . what people aren ' t realising is that russia and the gop hate machine won ' t go away if hillary doesn ' t run again .  they are priming for anyone who wins the dem nomination .  biden ,  harris ,  duckworth ,  booker ,  sanders ,  whomever ,  once they ' re the dem nominee they will be just as hated and just as maligned online by an army of bots making it seem real and cool to hate them and the gop will make them the devil incarnate like they did hillary . this gop hate machine didn ' t even start with clinton .  it started with obama ,  they made him the devil incarnate for the conservative base .  but obama was lucky that russia didn ' t deploy all their evil plans to give the presidency to his opponent and now we are dealing with not only a deranged gop but a hostile foreign interference to tilt our elections . personally i feel clinton is the one most ready to go up against this army and win for 2020 . 
1	agreed ,  it seems pretty obvious she ' s joking !  she ' s saying she doesn ' t want to run again ,  but wishes and / or feels she *should* be president right now .  and she ' s not wrong ! 
1	found the trump supporter . 
1	"i ' m the left and she energizes me . all we need is for the misogynists on the left to sit down ,  shut up ,  and stop calling everyone energized by her ""vagina voters"" and other slurs . and this time we will make them shut up .   no hiding in secret facebook groups this time .   loud ,  proud ,  public .   "
1	why ? the left refuses to even give warren ,  let alone harris a chance .  . 
1	why should she endorse an inexperienced person who lacks the credentials and chops to do the job ? the only other women even remotely qualified for the potus right now are pelosi and duckworth .   and neither are as qualified as clinton  ( who is the most qualified person ,  not the most qualified woman )  .   put harris or gillibrand in the cabinet for 8 years or so to prepare and then lets talk about them .   pelosi and duckworth have leadership experience that they lack . 
1	gillibrand would probably pose similar issues as hillary with her being unable to really motivate the liberal wing of the party because of her back and forth between conservative and liberal during the early part of her career ,  harris would probably be the better choice in my opinion .  but i ' m no expert here so i could be wrong . 
1	"actually she won the popular vote in the 2008 primary but obama got 230 more super delegates . so the sequence is ,  ""win the popular vote but have a non-democratic entity give the win to someone else ,  run again ,  win both the popular vote and the non-democratic entity ' s vote on the second go round"" . "
1	third time ' s the charm ,  baby . 
1	> i actually feel the same about warrentheyve been working to smear her for years . expect to see this with any female politician who is getting presidential candidate buzz .  i think were past those point of no return with hillary  ( sadly )  ,  but its important to fight the smear tactics rather than give into them .  
1	it ' s not really losing when your opponent stole the election .  
1	did she ?   we know she won millions more votes ,  but we don ' t know if the results in places like michigan ,  georgia ,  pennsylvania ,  and wisconsin are legitimate .   
1	the problem with hillary is that she cares about policy and running the country more than anything else so unless people change the way they look at our leaders ,  then hillary or someone like her is set up to fail .  
1	i really don ' t think she would win if she ran again .  if anything her running would energize the right all over again when that ' s the opposite of what you guys need ,  and she ' d further divide the left .  the right is too well versed on how to attack her and how to hit hard ,  it ' d be better to have a candidate whose fairly unknown and can ' t be smeared through the mud as much and turn off moderates or people who are wishy-washy about the whole thing .  historical precedence is not something to gamble four more years of trump against .  
-1	now this is spicy .  also ,  super speedy sticky ! 
-1	**we will fight it and we will win . **-rick scott last night ,  on the democrat attempts to cheat the election . 
-1	"*we will never surrender americas sovereignty to an unelected ,  unaccountable global bureaucracy . ""*   - president trump"
-1	honestly ,  this is the first meme i ' m having trouble even laughing at .   this whole thing is infuriating ,  saddening ,  that thing where you feel every emotion at once and aren ' t sure what to do about it .   this is not america if we just allow it to happen . 
-1	whew mods that was fast . 
-1	the hillary clinton of broward county
-1	they ' re currently stealing florida and texas . edit !  arizona not texas !  
-1	she looks more like ursula to me . 
-1	noticing that democrats are trying to steal elections is a threat to our democracy ! 
-1	#don ' t forget the bullshit happening in arizona as well !   
-1	tried ?  sounds like they are getting away with it in fl and maybe even az right now . 
-1	we should have been prepared for this .   after all the shit the dems pulled ,  all the way up to trump ' s inauguration ?   they have no doubt been preparing to steal each and every election they could ,  all across the country . 
-1	florida pede here .  i voted for desantis and scott .  i ' m closely watching this recount .  i know i won ' t stand for the dems stealing the election .  i just wonder other floridians will stand with me to drive out this evil corruption in our state .  if so ,  then who would ' ve thought that civil war 2 would start in florida ? 
-1	since djt bcecame president the left has not been able to contain itself ! every dirty ,  crafty ,  underhanded scheme is being exposed because they dont like losing !  !  !  !  ! 
-1	"this piece of shit has already been caught tampering with ballots in the past ,  she should have been removed long ago !   unchecked corruption is the problem .   it ' s not enough to ""investigate"" people ,  we need to fucking remove them .  "
-1	literal troll .  
-1	you ' re a crooked dirty jockey and you drive a crooked hoss ,  mrs .  grinch , 
-1	i like how you could use her hair as is . 
-1	let ' s see if it ' s  ' tried ,  '  or  ' succeeded .  '  the gop was inexcusably caught flatfooted .  snipes is a pro at stealing elections; she may yet succeed .  
-1	this picture makes my balls want to crawl up my anus for some reason .  .  . 
-1	hoping to see some handcuffs come out this time
-1	she is one dumb ,  ugly motherfucker .  this is actually a major improvement . 
-1	she said she only had 600k votes in broward county .   now they have another 300k they need to count ?   the clinton mafia brought them in with trucks .   shut it down ! 
-1	one thing that i thought this morning while on the crapper:  what if trump knew he had to flush their corruption this cycle ?  ?     the dems always use corruption in key locations ,  broward ,  philly ,  durham ,  to win key states .    this may end up being the best example ever of 4d chess .    the dems may have completely exposed their rue .    
-1	i ' d rather fuck that than the actual person . 
-1	related to wesley ?  *they all look the same ! *
-1	#lock 
-1	well it seems to be working wish our republican reps would come together and talk about this a little more .  
-1	> marcel ,  burn it down . 
-1	##meesa salti leebrall
-1	not just florida but arizona too
-1	dont worry pedes .  awan bros just found two more boxes of ballots in pakistan .  they did not check contents because they did not want to tamper with them .  everything is fine .  
-1	i hear that snipes found a few thousand votes for al gore .  .  .  . 
-1	that picture is raysis !  ! 
-1	what do you mean tried ? she ' s already stolen the ag race and republicans won ' t do anything about it
-1	by all accounts ,  trying and succeeding .  now isn ' t the time for mockery .  it ' s the time for action . 
-1	this grinch needs to see the inside of a prison cell .  federal offenses need to be dealt with by the new acting ag .  
-1	remember that time crooked tried to secretly meet with brenda snipes to steal the presidential election but someone happened to be there to take a picture of it ?  that was awesome ! 
-1	low iq maxine waters ugly twin sister 
-1	i wish this movie had a sexy co-star .

-1	shits too serious . 
-1	voter card with picture and number that can only be used once with a record of your vote 
-1	this is almost as convincing as the smash bros .  grinch leak from a month ago lol
-1	she in jail yet ? 
-1	i  firmly believe that anyone found guilty of undermining our democracy the way she has should be publicly hanged .  if that doesn ' t make you an enemy of the united states of america ,  i don ' t know what does . 
-1	we did what we were supposed to do .   if republicans want to continue to get walked over by lawlessness then they made their bed and have to lay in it . 
-1	well so far shes doing it ,  don ' t sound like there ' s anything happening
-1	this shit going on in fl and az is making so mad .   i ' m feeling disgusted .  i usually read t_d to cheer myself up but its not working . 
-1	this is why we need an online secure voting system that can only be accessed via fingerprint ,  voter id and social security number .  all results tallied by our federal government .  
-1	i need a glass of milk
-1	eyes glossed over from loathing ,  lying ,  drinkin '  .   the reptile brain has taken over . 
-1	and she is getting caught red handed ! 
-1	sure hope so .  getting a little nervous about the onslaught of cheating that the demonrats are doing .  
-1	*we will never back down .   we will fight for you the american people .  and we will win ,  win ,  win . *
-1	i feel you !  it ' s that feeling of dread and utter helplessness that you just can ' t get over no matter how hard you try .  i won ' t be able to sleep well at night until this thing is finally over .  
-1	the feeling of helplessness in the face of injustice .  and they wonder why we love and protect the 2nd
-1	we need more real stickies of fl because this will last months with judges and probably won ' t be finished even by january .  we don ' t need stupid unfunny memes . 
-1	finally .  getting worried there  .  . 
-1	we have the best mods ,  don ' t we folks ? 
-1	pretty much every politician in broward county is hitlery . 
-1	"the two lost tx u . s .  house seats were lost because those suburban districts are prime ""kill zones"" when a retarded charismatic snake oil salesman like o ' rourke drives out the turnout .  if it were actual widespread fraud they would have bagged 5 or 6 house seats . "
-1	same ! 
-1	cnnpc probably
-1	az is doomed .  we actually have hope for fl since the potus tweeted about fl and not the other states . 
-1	folks in arizona have a life-altering choice to make if the dems succeed in stealing the election .  
-1	arizona is already lost . 
-1	i wouldn ' t count florida out just yet .  rick scott is still the governor and will exhaust every resource available to him to fight this thing  ( he ' s also rich and can afford some very good lawyers )  .  that doesn ' t mean we ' ll win ,  but we certainly won ' t go down without a fight .  arizona ,  however ,  looks to be doomed .  it ' s very sad . 
-1	i am praying that trump and all have something .  proof etc of cheating .  .  .  . snipes is deep state appointed by jeb bush years ago .  she is paid for  .  .  . broward is corrupt so they cover for her . 
-1	fl pede here too ,  all 4 in our family voted de santis /  scott .  i will stand with you ! 
-1	please make this a main post ! 
-1	catapult this fat bitch into the atlantic
-1	after being busted the first time ,  she should have never been allowed near another election again and jailed .  this is what happens when there is no consequences to what they do .   
-1	i know me too .  .  . we kept being told to .  . wait .  .  .  .  . but enough is enough ! 
-1	sorry .   the mangy dog who smells bad character is played by debbie wasserman-shultz . 
-1	are you q idiots done now ? 
-1	he need some milk !  wheres our spicy bot ? 
-1	real cows milk
-1	i need this bitch in prison 
-1	exactly ,  and now they are trying this crap in every district they can .  this is an infiltration that is getting more and more efficient .  by 2020 the fraud election machine will get better if things stay this way .  
-1	i meant with all these bullshit recounts .  arizona now gone ,  florida about to be gone .  .  . 
-1	disagree- the illegals aren ' t evenly distributed . 
-1	serious question .  are the veritas videos not proof of cheating ? 
-1	> this is what happens when there is no consequences to what they do . but it ' s even worse than this .  .  .  she was left in her position on purpose .   she is there to help democrats steal elections ,  so the real question for me is who is the person that has allowed her to stay in her position ?   it ' s just too convenient that she ' s always there in every election to help the democrats cheat .  
-1	what if it was soy milk ?  
-1	always an interesting post from you sir . 
-1	nope .  fl was likely barely saved last night . 
-1	yes but what happens .  .  . nothing ! in broward co nothing happens as those above snipes cover for her ,  courts /  judges etc .  it is corrupt central in broward .  isn ' t broward always in the news ? 
-1	cultural appropriation detected
-1	would soy milk even work against such spice ? 
-1	great .  now make sure they don ' t steal fl and az .  otherwise we have a 52-48 majority yet again depending on murkowski ,  collins ,  and romney .

-1	anything the president does these days is automatically met with legal challenge anyway . this is a step in the right direction .   also ,  if they move to have immediate hearings and assign the additional judges ,  this could be a good thing . 
-1	tent city is ready to house them .  expedited assylum judges on standby for claims .  there is nothing saying we have to process 5000 in a day .  we can do 100 a week .  forcing them to stay at border in an orderly process means we do it on our terms .

-1	with the mississippi runoff at the end of the month well be at 54
-1	it ' s infuriating that democrats want these illegals to come over .  it ' s beyond disrespectful to law-abiding ,  good people that applied and waited legally such as yourself . 
-1	lol how far we ' ve come when that could knock someone out of a race .

-1	pardon me for expecting that the link would not go to a nov .  1 transcript . 
-1	that is counting the theft of fl and az
-1	you are right .  not happening if we hang onto az and fl . 
-1	it ' s happening right now if we don ' t stop it
-1	even with ms ,  if democrats get fl and az ,  we will be 52 .  the latter 2 states are supposed to push us to 54 . 
-1	there was none ,  i was watching fox news ,  couldnt find a link
-1	from my understanding ,  if they enter the country illegally ,  they are no longer able to apply for asylum .  .  they have to apply legally through a port of entry .     
-1	hot happening
-1	i saw this story on nbc news !   .  .  . *said no one ever*
-1	we must treasure and protect the 2nd amendment at all costs .  we do not want to become the uk or sweden . 
-1	bet the offender will be back on the streets in short order ,  unfortunately .  hopefully another great citizen like this one is there to stop him next time as well
-1	is this the tyranny our founders were concerned about ?  
-1	the active operation by the democrats to steal the election is of tantamount importance .  but so is preserving 2a .  we can walk and chew gum . 
-1	but that one woman cried and said she wanted gun control !  we should tear up the constitution ! 
-1	i don ' t carry to protect other people and be a hero ,  in an active shooter situation i ' m running ,  hiding ,  unless i ' m cornered .  that said ,  the sound of a woman screaming for help is something you can ' t ignore .  well ,  except those crazy bitches in kenzo who get too high and start freaking out in the middle of the street .  what i ' m trying to say is ,  this guy is a hero . 
-1	the amount of shit i hear going on in california these days is crazy .  people i know that still live there are telling me they ' re getting followed home from work .  others have had their front doors kicked down and houses robbed in broad daylight .  another got jumped in a parking lot by four guys and got robbed .  luckily haven ' t heard anyone i know there being raped yet .  stay safe pedes ,  the news isn ' t reporting this shit ,  only shootings to take away gun rights .  
-1	i wonder if the guy played red dead 2 .  if so he was well trained for this lol
-1	ive done something very similar but it just never made headlines .  many times the stories about how guns saved lives dont .  
-1	"the left to women: ""sorry ,  you ' re just going to have to accept being raped .  if you don ' t manage to attract help from your screams ,  just accept that it ' s going to happen .  you ' re not allowed to arm yourselves to protect yourselves .  just call the police after ,  if you ' re still alive ,  and report it"""
-1	whats wrong with the uk or sweden ? 
-1	"lots of things .  sweden has a serious rape problem ,  the uk has seen an upswing in acid attacks and young girls being groomed by gangs of ""asians"" into sexual slavery and there is nothing anyone can do about it .  talking about it in the uk can end up with imprisonment . "
-1	"yeah .  too many people are reporting rape in sweden .  and trump introduced ""stop enabling sex traffickers act"" in the us because it never happens here . "
-1	these people vote in the people and policies that ruin their home ,  then run because it ' s impossible to survive there .  then will come to my home and do the same thing there .  .  blows my mind . 
-1	texas is going to be ruined 
-1	i met one last night at 7-11 .  .  .  a leftist ,  not a commiefornian .  this was a white guy .  older ,  he wanted beto to win .  i was shocked that in texas you had people openly supporting that guy .  but then again ,  dallas is a blue city .  whats even more strange about dallas is tha ,  its like a socialism experiment in real time .  the city of dallas  implemented heavy taxes on business and seemingly overnight ,  downtown dallas became a gohst town filled with empty building ' s of business that vacated dallas to go to to cities surrounding dallas while dallas contracts and chokes on its own socialist blood . 
-1	san francisco ,  the poop capital of america ,  why would they want to leave the paradise they created ? 
-1	california is the primary tumor .  and now it ' s metastasizing . 
-1	fucking locusts .  destroy everything then move on
-1	damn .  .  . there are already 500 people each week moving into austin . 
-1	npcs are a plague ,  they infect an area and spread dumb policies and group think
-1	texans need to be vocal to transplants media campaigns ,  flyers ,  word of mouth .  tell them not to import their political views ,  remind them what made texas a state they wanted to come to in the first place .  show them what values texas represents . 
-1	quick ,  someone pass right to life laws and policies that say trans is a mental illness lmao
-1	exactly why ca house votes should be recounted .   not just because of sf peeps ,  but i suspect many californians feeling the bitter .   hollyweird is not the majority in ca ,  remember - they are only 1% . 
-1	the locusts are swarming 
-1	i live in austin and couldnt believe how many people voted to raise their taxes - 65-70+% !  !  the one proposition that failed was one requiring a third party audit of the citys business - failed by 58% ?  dfuq ?  you agree to borrow almost $900million and then dont want somebody ensuring it is spent well ?  i dont get it .  
-1	texas ,  i recommend walling off the whole state . 
-1	we have survived forever with no wall to the south .   where we need a wall is to the west and northeast to stop these leftist morons from moving here .  don ' t california my texas .  
-1	then they ' ll vote for the same things that killed san fran / 
-1	like a flock of shitbirds leaving their shitnests ,  randy . 
-1	texas pede here - can confirm ,  see more and more cuckifornia plates every day here in the san antonio area . 
-1	when its all said and done ,  california will be composed of rich people ,  overpaid government employees and poor people .  just like a 3rd world country . 
-1	time for states to put a massive entrance tax for residents of california ,  make it impossible for them to move there
-1	locusts .  
-1	they are like gypsies .  shit all over the place and move to the next location 
-1	well the cost of living is so high .  who blames them for wanting to move to texas ?  they want to benefit from conservative policies but not give up their ideologies .  thats where i have issues .  
-1	california knowingly infecting texas with hiv .   
-1	historical dem plan .  get state .  make state so shitty it needs you .  make it more shit so people get tired and leave .  people leaving know nothing but how to vote dem .  make new state shit .  repeat .  edit: this made me think .  if i moved somewhere by choice that was awesome .  i hope i would vote in a way locally that would support that states history .  
-1	they took california .  they also have new york .  all they need is texas and the rest will be forced to bend the knee .  
-1	as always ,  it ' s not about race .  it ' s about overall behavior .  a bunch of alabama folk moving to new york would change that culture  ( probably for the better )  and new yorkers would protest it .  
-1	the need to keep on going south to mexico and beyond .   .  my home is already compromised enough . 
-1	those that are moving out ,  are most likely people who hate it there already because they are in the minority .  probably some pedes tired of san franscisco .  at least thats what i hope . 
-1	"in san francisco ,  ""texas"" means ""austin"" . "
